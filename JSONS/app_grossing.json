      "Evidently Tinder has its own scoring system for profiles which may make it more difficult to get matches. For instance the more you swipe right, the less likely you are to be matched. What's the point, Tinder? Are you going to go into our profiles and decide which information is arbitrarily appropriate for a match as well? How about the number of times we swipe right? What's the criteria for determining all of this? Let users judge for themselves if they want to match with someone or not.",
      "Good profiles but the app is full of bugs, the most annoying being: - from time to time, the app needs to be restarted because new messages are not displayed or the profiles' pictures are endlessly loading; - messages are not sent; - with the \"Golden profile\", if you chose \"Control who sees you - Only People I've Liked\", I get no single match, because my likes are not shown to those people; please fix this bug because the option \"Only People I've Liked\" is now useless;",
      "Got shadow banned. Twice. When I first started on my second account I was regularly getting matches and messages. After about 3 weeks it stopped working almost entirely. It seems impossible to get matches unless they're bots. Tinder is a good concept but when its shadowbanned me and numerous others for unclear reasons I cant help but dislike it. If you guys (tinder) could figure out how to resolve this issue youd earn my support, use, and possibly money. Until then it's a no.",
      "Terribly moderated and no $ = no profile views. Half of the matches I've gotten have been prostitutes, a quarter of the people I see in the app are bots or catfishes or \"looking for a plug.\" What's more is I've noticed that the only times that I get likes or matches is when I JUST SO HAPPEN to PAY for a boost, which are $8 a pop. Day 1 they reel you in by giving your profile top priority. I got 10 likes the first day, but since then, only when I pay. Its predatory.",
      "The app is great honestly. Meeting new people is always so peculiar and exciting. Sometimes people dont answer back immediately and that's okay. It cycles people over again sometimes but not as much as you'd think. Most often than not there are plenty of faces and so many exceptional opportunities if you just allow yourself to be a good human being instead of a creeper. If you are having a hard time matching with someone, dont fall to critical! Just be sincere, that's what people like."

      "Good quality and a pretty decent interface, but the ads are ridiculous. Most streams force you to watch a 30 seconds ad before you can actually start viewing what your use the app for. From there, it just gets worse. I've frequently been subjected to SEVEN straight ads of 15 to 30 seconds in duration. That means a few full minutes of interruption, which always come at the worst time of the steam and they aren't skippable in any way. Oh, and you'll see the same handful of ads over and over.",
      "Was good starting out. But now I can't see certain people for whatever reason. I can go to other streamers and see them just fine, but for one group which I also follow on YouTube as well as Twitch, I can hear them, but not see them. This is really irritating because I used to be able to see them, but after an update it leaves me with a black window. The streamers belive its because they're using iPhones and I'm using a Samsung, but that seems like a really stupid reason. Please fix.",
      "Great behind the scenes and you can multitask with a background window, which many will love. Also extra points go to this app cause this can livestream certain games others can't. The only reason that it doesnt have five stars is that it has a certain delay and its missing some features other apps have but if does i will be glad to fix this rating to five stars",
      "So the content is great. App works okay, if you sit your phone up, don't touch it, and preferably stream only audio. If you go into pop up, it will lag and sometimes just stop. It will lag and stutter all the time, no matter the stream. It loses your place in VODs for channels you're subscribed to while you're watching then if *anything* else happens on your phone, and now, it's been playing BLARING ads over top of streams I'm subscribed to. I'd love to list more issues but I'm out of space.",
      "Update on Feb 24 (recent) killed audio only and background audio play on my s8. It was working fine for months/years until the update yesterday. Hopefully some bug they can fix quik. Already tried reinstalling the app and nothing. Other than that it's been working fine. Will update when fixed. And yes background audio is enabled."

Im considering cancelling my subscription.",
      "The HBO app constantly kicks me out of the video saying they can't play the video, forces me to go back to then relaunch the video. I watched a movie where I had to do this about 50 times no joke, this is the most annoying Thing of this app. It would be one thing if it didn't happen on every show but it happens every single program I've ever watched and HBO since the moment I installed this app. I hope HBO has a fix for this because I can't believe I'm the only one that this is happening to",
      "Worst streaming service. Every interaction is frustrating. Too bad your burying good content with terrible ux. Rewind is frustrating. Navigating is frustrating. Getting kicked out is frustrating. Video quality is really bad. Loads forever. None of my other streaming apps do this I have solid fiber connection.",
      "I'm paying $25 a month so that ten minutes into a movie the app can stop working. Permanently. Turn the console off, uninstall the app, switch to a computer, it doesn't matter, the playback ends and won't go past the marker it first buffered at. And yes, it's across all my devices. I can watch Netflix, Hulu and Prime all in 4K but HBO, the most expensive one, crashes constantly. According to the help line, my internet download/upload and latency is more than DOUBLE what HBO requires to playback HD video. Their solution? To email me later when the \"app developers\" think of something. So answer me something. Why am I paying a monthly rate that is bonkers expensive compared to other streaming services for an app that quite actually has more buffering than a movie streaming site that will show me this title for FREE? The only thing this app has going for it is the original content which, while great, you can find anywhere else online with less buffering. And that doesn't cost you $25 a month.",
      "Frustrating interface that is not intuitive. No movie information page is available, it just immediately plays the movie with any touch, useless. Category organization is not employed unless an alphabetical only listing of every movie is the only category. Chromecast functionality appears to work."

      "This app only delivers an OK experience. It gets the job done. But there are many shortcomings. First of all, the UI takes pretty much space. Secondly, there is no night mode. In addition to these, this app lacks customization options. It constantly asks you to install Messenger. The story bar is huge. It stays open on background even if you force stop it.",
      "Once in a blue moon this app works properly, it's great when it works... But when you get an update for it, you always seem to have problems with it. Tech support seem to take ages to fix any problems on the app and they hardly ever answer back on your problem reports. I have just updated my phone with the new update and I wish I hadn't done it. It's been over a week now and still no fix on my problem and no replies or confirmation regarding my reports. Still waiting 😠",
      "Do remember to login at least one time within three months. If you forget to do, your account will be lock and unable to login anymore even you have correct ID and password. Although you can request for account recovery, but there will be no reply to your registered email inbox of whether your application is successful or fail. You can submit multiple time as you like, but you will never recover your account simply because customer service is not available.",
      "Last month I closed a page I had on FB in favor of my personal page. When switching, I was given only 2 ways to confirm my identity, one of which was unfeasible as it looks like a scam, the other was uploading my ID. Fast forward a month, still no help or response- it is impossible to get any help or customer service. I'm locked out of Facebook, locked out of Messenger, and there's no way to contact them for help when you're locked out! What an absolute garbage platform.",
      "Like the new features. Hate some things though. Well mostly one. Losing your messages or writing when connection is lost. It happened so much. It is not managed well. Offline work and caching and management should be well done. And no data should be lost. You are Facebook before anything. And Big five. I hope I.m gonna see that. Love too the Facebook react team hhh"

      "Hi,  I just downloaded Tango, 2 weeks ago. Previously I was a bigo user.. This Tango App. Is amazing.  I tried several times to purchase coins through Gpay but it came with an error      \"payment/Card declined\".. Whereas it is my same Visa Debit card through which I do purchasing of diamonds on bigo.. Please suggest me any other mean or way through which I can do purchasing of coins in tang other than Gpay",
      "The support system is too bad, I've been trying to contact them for two days and no response. So you really have a support system ? Also this app now has a lot of scammers and still now I didn't get any support for the support team as well. Update : 09/03/2020 I've just put a comment here complaining against there support system and they are asking me to contact the support team again. What a joke. Do you hire clowns to work on your support system?? Guys don't waste Money on this app"

      "There is some critical bug (or by design) which withholds the matches in the match queue. Have been using the app for weeks, not a single match in the queue. Then all of a sudden I wake up to 50+ matches in the queue overnight? How long have these been there? This wouldn't happen overnight. Something is broken here. Then after a few hours, the 50+ vanishes? Also, superswipe doesn't seem to make any difference, especially if they show inactive profiles. Spend your romantic efforts elsewhere.",
      "You subscribe for a month you get 6 months. Probably the worst thing in our immediate imagination and yes we've imagined hell before, bumble is no different. It's like if God went to hell. This app is everything it's not a Useless good-for-nothing app. I wouldn't download it again if it was the last thing on Earth. I'll take my chances on my own to prevent scums like these from taking advantage (exploiting) of the people it's supposed to bring together.",
      "Notification alerts on this app are really buggy. Every few hours I'll get a notification telling me that Mrs. X sent me a message, but when I open up the app it's an old message. And then again in a couple hours I'll get another notification for the same stupid old message. I think the developers are doing that just so people will be constantly engaging with the app but it's so annoying I'm about ready to uninstall it.",
      "Great premise, just rarely get matches. I love the idea of girls messaging first but I can't tell you how many times I've had a match expire even after extending it. Whether it was someone who doesn't check the app much or if they just decided they weren't into me is unknown but it still feels like kind of a waste of space in my phone. I prefer tinder still. As a huge plus there arent any bots on this app though.",
      "Terrible app. I started an account, went premium because the blurred prospective matches was frustrating. I would get notis constantly for the same thing. So I deleted my account to try to fix it on my own (since customer service is no help) and then I find out I can't even restore my purchase. So now they essentially stole my money. Great app if you just want to exercise your thumb from side to side."

      "I used Turbo tax for the very first time i done my taxes by myself. It was a little harder that i expected but i got it done. Having to wait now because i didnt print them off right away ( i used my cellphone to file instead of computer) , it said it needed some kind of attached voucher when i printed it off. I ended up calling DOR and they gave me a number to put in the memo. Still waiting for my return and that means still waiting to purchase diff vehicle.... :((",
      "Worked fine last year, not this year. I filed my taxes on the 16th of February and received my confirmation. More than a month later, I still haven't received my tax return. I call the IRS they show no status. I call TurboTax they show the same. Long story short, I found out today that I was lied to, had to pay $150 for a deluxe(even though it said upgrade for $50)I didn't need last year. I will never use TurboTax again. Edit: Don't have social media. App keeps closing for live help.",
      "The app cost $150 for what I can get everywhere else for less than $20. Plus the app has become cumbersome and deceptive, with adds after every section. I used TurboTax for years but no more. The response I got was a form response and doesn't remove any fees. In fact it only highlighted their deceptive fee practices. I want to be clear that the service I required that took my bill to $150 was the form for my student loan repayment. I used another service and it was free.",
      "I would gladly recommend TurboTax, but not the app. This year I used the app instead of filing on a computer like I normally do. I was not happy with the app. It made the experience much more stressful by randomly saving and forcing you to go back to the beginning of a section and only to click through everything all over again and to add insult to injury, it repeatedly throws an upgrade for some Max service each time it makes you restart. I'll keep using TurboTax, but just not the app.",
      "The real free version is hidden! If you make less then like 60k, you qualify for a truly free version. The app will ask you pay (and not show the IRS free file option) if you have one of the many pretty common tax situations. The IRS free file version through tubo tax is through there web interface ONLY and it's far inferior to the app. You can, however, start on the app and when it tells you to pay, you can convert using the web version and continue with the info you already entered."

      "Was on it for about 30 minutes before it kicked me off. Tried to log back in multiple, multiple times. Changed emails. Still nothing. I was in mid conversation. Never in my life have I had to deal with this from an app, a fairly popular one at that. Was fine while I was able to use it, I guess I'll never be able to use it again lmao. The 30 minutes was fun while it lasted though. Really crappy of the developers to see all these comments about the same thing and not fix it. Very disappointed.",

The other main problem I see is the actual people, 500 characters is not enough to describe everything but the app has potential needs some work.",
      "Was using the app when I was suddenly logged out and now it is saying my email is blocked. Have sent an email to support with no reply yet, I would like to get this figured out asap please. UPDATE- They stated my account was deleted due to \"violating terms of service\" despite making the account at 5am, promptly falling asleep, and using the app for a whopping 1 full hour while I was awake. Whatever, it's nowhere near as good of a site as it used to be. Don't waste your time with this app.",
      "I have been a member since 2007 and I was logged on today and all of a sudden it force logs me out. It asked me to change my password and I did but it still keeps saying invalid login info. I just spent actual money to purchase coins and now have basically no way of getting in my account and dont know why or have any way to contact support to find out why.",
      "I usually like this app, but I'm been asked to establish my username a couple of times. But now I was kicked out and I can't use my password even though it was the exact one I use for my email. I sent requests for the password renewal confirmation code to my email but I haven't been receiving it. I seriously dont know why I was booted from the app but I just wanna know"

I've tried to clear the cache, I've tried reaching out on Twitter a couple of time, and sent quite a few feedback reports, and nothing has been fixed, nor have I heard back from anyone. I just want my Drive fixed.",
      "I cannot access the files that I made available offline easily. They can't be managed by other apps. Folders cannot be downloaded to be used by other apps (files can be). Audio player tries not to be an audio player. Has no advantage over the other suite apps like Sheets. In other words I need to play audio files in order, but it doesn't do it well and doesn't let other apps do it. I don't want to download everything just because I might need them. So yeah, this app is a joke that is not funny",
      "I loved the app, until the problem appeared. I lost the comments on the pdf files. I think those were saved offline on my phone, and when they synchronized with the drive instead of sending comments to drive it seemed that they were overwritten by a file with no comments in it. So now comments are lost. Also, I couldn't add screenshots of the problem in the feedback tool, as you have only the option to add screenshot of the place from where you opened the feedback tool (a bit strange)",
      "Really love Google Drive. Keeps photos in touch whenever I accidentally delete them in my actual Gallery. I always take screenshots so it's really nice that I have separate folders for separate years because it's very organized just the way I like it. This isn't the only app I use to keep photos but it does get the job done and it makes me happy. It's not difficult to share or download whatever is in my drive unless you aren't a geeky kind of gal like me then I don't know how others use this.😅",
      "I think it's a good app it's pretty simple to use but I am having issues. I try to get rid of photos and folders and so i put them in the trash then i delete the trash; but when i find more things to get rid of and go to the trash all of my stuff is still there and now theres so much i have to buy storage even though i continuously try to get rid of the trash.

      "I use it mostly for backing up photos from my phone. I have a samsung and the automatic backup only saves the camera roll, not downloaded pics, or whatsapp pics/videos. So you have to manually upload those to dropbox. And then they don't integrate smoothly. They don't show up in the main photos tab, and when you find your photos, they appear out of order. Using the app is fine, moving to folders is fine, but the backup feature isn't great",
      "54% increase without confirmation, really this is another case of tech companies screwing Australians over! In a global crisis btw. I never once gave consent for such a massive price hike for such a stupid amount of data that I don't need and definitely don't want. Yes this is probably hidden within pages of small print that you know nobody reads, but to actually hike your prices up over 50% in one hit is below the belt to say the least. And customers in other countries only received 20% more.??",
      "The website streams videos wonderfully. I can skip around a video without issue. But I had to get the app because you can't watch longer than an hour on the site. The app is horrible. On either wifi or 5g, it lags regularly, and if you try to skip to a different point in the video it will stop and buffer for 20-25 minutes. Website has no buffer and plays instantly. Fix your app. Edit: (2 months later, no better. Streaming a video is still abysmal even on version fios high speed net)",
      "Would have given zero stars if possible. Purchased the Dropbox Plus 30-day free trial but found it to be not useful. So cancelled the Plus subscription on the Dropbox app. However, the subscription continued because I did not cancel it via the Play Store. Only realized this after receiving credit card statement. However, both Google Play support and Dropbox support refused to process my refund. Both parties pushed the responsibility to refund to each other. Google Play claims to just be a store front and cannot process \"third-party\" refund. Dropbox claims that they do not have access to Google Play payment platforms and all purchases made via the Play store cannot be refunded via Dropbox itself. USELESS and beware when you get the free trial.",
      "I have been a PAYING 10TB customer for years and I'm done!!! this app and it's latest updates (updates over the last year) are horrendously GARBAGE! None of my pics that I take will ever sync up to my DB account unless I go in and manually push them there. The PC application once installed freshly is fine until the first time I connect my phone to it and then i get the infamous error \"smart sync is experiencing an issue\" and will never go away from there. If I uninstall the PC app, uninstall it off my phone, reinstall it all, it's fine UNTIL i connect my phone back to the account at which point same ignorant error message appears. Until about 6 months ago I NEVER had an issue with my phone synching to my dropbox account, now it's nothing more than a piece of junk! I WILL NOT RENEW MY ACCOUNT AGAIN.."

      "I've been using iheart for a little over a year with all access and it's great if you want to listen to an album from almost any band or musician, I like to create custom playlists too. the reason for the 2 stars: say I start listening to a custom radio station, I give some songs a thumb up and some a thumb down. They will continue to play the same songs, on top of that they will play songs that I gave a thumbs down to. When you do give a thumbs down they will continue to play the song.",
      "I have a very good experiance with this app. I love how you can can choose from different geners of music. There is not much ads eithier. You can also have this app open and play a game and the music will still play. You can also play different radio stations. There are in app purchases than Can be made but its not nesaccary. Over all this is a GREAT app and i love soo much. Listen to your favorite music today and dowload this :) :)",
      "Why does it want to play from the newest pod cast to the oldest. Always having to manually choose the next cast. Also. I dislike when you are listen to a cast and you want to close all apps and the cast stops. This doesn't happen with other radio apps. They still play and you can access the controls from the pull down menu. I have enjoyed many pod cast. But wish there was a way to make a play list.",
      "App really sucks. I listen to Rover's Morning Glory and there are nothing but CONSTANT problems loading the pod cast. I am a few days behind listening to the main show so trying to catch up with the pod cast is damn near impossible. My most recent problems include the sloooow motion talk (although the commercial you play, plays flawless) and it doesn't save your place when it just closes itself out. I have a galaxy s9 if that matters. You guys really need to fix this",
      "Nice app but it does have the usual ads, however, if there has to be ads, I wish they would at least be in a language I understand. That is pretty annoying though the ads aren't all that often. The search feature works for searching for a specific station or podcast as long at you know the name but doesn't seem to search descriptions so it's not all that helpful. Otherwise this is a good app. Low data usage considering the nature of the app which is great for someone living in rural Canada."

      "I can't change my photo, it still shows me 169 days streak and it's always crashing and freezing. I reinstalled the app - didn't help, so I deleted my account and created new one and I am still experiencing the same issues. In the past it didn't take so much data, but now it takes about 700MB monthly just because of some useless features. This app has been ruined down in the present. The simplier was the app the better it was. Please, give us back our old good MyFitnessPal. (1 year experience)",
      "So, I'm confused about how the diary is supposed to work? I click diary complete and then it shows the projection, but then I can only X out, which brings me back to the diary and I am still able to \"complete diary\" and/or add food/water/exercise to the day. How does that work? The UI is really odd. Otherwise it seems to be working fine.",
      "This app has been great for me. It finds a lot of foods that aren't exactly the norm and has a scanner. For some reason though, it doesn't seem to recognize when I've entered info and it will send me reminders to input meals during the day that are already in the program. Overall.... Highly recommend. I'm on day 10 and am down 4 lbs.",
      "I am just using the free version but still very helpful in keeping track of what I eat and how much cals i have left. There is a search capability you can just input the name of the food (even name of the dish) and you will be provided several choices where you choose the quantity and the corresponding calories for that. May I suggest that maybe you can incorporate letting us change the daily calorie goal in the free version. Thank you.",
      "Really good to keep track of everything. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the stuff hidden behind paywall. But I understand that I guess. Love how you can track your macros and other nutrients in the app. I also wish it was a bit easier to see multiple days at a glance but it's not too hard. Overall great and I use it every day."

It does not always work though. I am unhappy because this platform has been unstable for a couple years. I have had the app on different phones and still it malfunctions",
      "The app is absolutely worthless unless you pay for their (rather expensive) monthly premium. You cannot see who is interested in you, who has liked your profile, etc...Basically the only thing that this app lets you do is play its incomprehensible mini game included with it. Waste of time and phone storage, darling. Maybe you'll be worth something someday though, hm?",
      "I like this app but is problem is my keyboard wont open when I want to make now text post on my phone i don't understand why you ask for tickets when people explain a problem when you can actually ask yourself why is it happening? I have to constantly tap where the keyboard should appear and I've only experienced this issue here I can tap for a very long time before the keyboard appears and that's a hit and miss because it doesn't always work",
      "This is the best app out there if you're looking to get spammed with nothing but bots. I'm not sure I've seen 1 legitimate human so far. Within the first 24 hours I have 88 bots, and a constant stream of spam/scam messages keeping me up well into the night. The app is more like a game vs an actual serious dating app. Don't consider this app if you're actually trying to be serious with your life.",
      "When you pay for premium account, they still show you ads when they specifically advertise that you won't see any. . they are double dipping by charging people for premium and also getting the money by showing these premium users ads. 🤷🏾‍♂️😔 Update :I contacted support a few times they just generic responses thanks for feedback type response and close the ticket.

I was on the phone on hold (supposed to be 20 minutes) for over an hour no never receive any answer or assistance. They took my money out for payment. Why can't I log in on my tablet or o my android.

When I try to play app on my TV it doesn't load completely and when i can finally get to the show I'm looking for it won't load to play now. Been working okay fir a while but now i can't watch anything! So frustrating that I give up! Oh and no closed captioning?! Not cool at all! Please help!",
      "App immediately takes me to create account screen where I'm stuck in a loop. I put in my email and password and of course it says an account already exists with that email. When I try to back out it gives me a message saying I've already paid but if I want to access content I have to input my information. There are no other options on this screen.",
      "The app certainly gets the job done, however it's far from the smoothest experience. It can be difficult to find new things of interest to watch, particularly without proper genre browsing and no recommendations. As well, streaming to a Chromecast is finicky. There's no option to skip intros or recaps and there's no autoplay for watching episodes back to back. Episodes also occasionally start in the wrong language. Hopefully these things will get fixed in the future.",
      "I wish they would give an option to disable autoplay...this is a common feature on streaming apps! At least play videos from my playlist! There's a lot of older content too. I probably won't renew at the end of my subscription period. The app also uses over a gigabyte of storage...why? Netflix uses 212mb. Disney+ uses 345mb, and prime uses 627mb...smh"

      "in my experience of using this app, it was great. their stories and content were great and it's easy to use. but my problem is the coins. can you try use a different methods to get some free coins like watching an advertisement to get some free coins, play a mini game to get some prize, and etc. sorry if this is too much but this is my opinion. if you exceed my expectations, i'll give you 5 stars. hope you understand.",
      "If you're a fan of web comics this is a must have. Webtoon has a massive collection of high quality comics that update regularly. It's kind of refreshing to be able to stumble across a comic and not find out the artist went on a permanent hiatus a month ago. While I have a lot of praise there is also a number of issues with this app. The app is buggy and the coin system (whether you agree in a paying system or not) is not designed well. Let's say you pay for the next 4 episodes now you either have to continue paying every week to receive the most recent episode or you're going to have to wait four weeks for you the next episode to become free. To me that sounds more like a trap then a purchasable service. Finally my biggest issue and the reason I'm writing this in the first place is the lack of communication between the app and the website. If I've been reading a comic using the website on my computer and the go catch a train or something I cant just bring up the app and go from where I left off I have to spend half my time working out my most recently read page because the app only remembers from the last time I was on my phone. This app has a lot of potential I hope these issues get fixed in the future.",
      "I really liked all these content that had been created and that I get to read them, but I would like my \"read\" status for each episode to maybe sync to cloud like the rest of the data? Like subscriptions. It is kinda annoying to have to scan through some of the episodes to find out what I have and haven't read. It would have been a 5 star if that was a feature",
      "I absolutely love the app, tons of amazing stories and easy to operate, but I have a Samsung and when I read a comic sometimes the page gets stuck then glitches back to the main screen and it can happen over and over again on the same EPISODE, I thought it was just my old phone, but now I have a new one I know it's not the phone it's the app, I really hope you can get it fixed so I can read and enjoy all of the amazing stories y'all publish!",
      "Love the comics (glad they are translated). I'm so impatient, so I do cave to purchase the coins once I binge read the comic. However, if you don't want to purchase coins you have to wait a certain amount of time to pass before able to view. However, all the creators out there works hard on their stories. Some great stories. Sub Zero, Drawn to you, True Beauty, Freaking Romance, Let's Play, Magical Forest, Midnight Poppy Land, Dangerous Session and many more amazing reads!! There are some bugs."

      "This CBS media streaming app does what it is supposed to: stream content, both free and subscription-based. I started using it on a Moto G7 and now on a Samsung A50, both running Android 9, and it works just fine. Do I wish there weren't any ads? Sure. Did I know what I was signing up for? Yes. Yes I did. So, unless something legitimately wrong or bad happens, I'm going to give it 5 stars.",
      "I have to say that I really have enjoyed Star Trek Picard and Discovery, but I have an issue that needs attention please. We need a way to access the \"Full screen\" mode. Laptops are not like televisions, so the \"widescreen\" mode you have is reducing the Laptop screen size. We appreciate your assistance with this problem. Can we have an option please to exit \"widescreen\" and go to \"Full screen\" mode in the Future? A small request hopefully, as we do pay for the streaming service. Thank you!",
      "This app is not the same as it was the first time I tried it.The first time there were not as many ads as there are now, and it played and casted better than it does now. The show I try to watch has problems casting, when it does work it disconnects then I start it again and instead of starting where it left off it starts at the beginning. By the time you get the program back to where you were it cuts off again. Very aggravating! Thinking about canceling this app just not worth the aggravation",
      "The free access is bogus. I signed up for the free trial & I'm supposed to have limited commercials. I don't. I have constant commercials just like before. False advertising to lure people in. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Cancelling trial since no sense in having it when everything is the same as the free app. Just when I think this app can't get any worse it did. Trying to watch the young & the restless & for the past 45 min I've been watching nothing but commercials which I hate.",
      "I just did your new update and its horrible. Cant even watch my soap. It keeps stopping for long periods! It was fine before, dont fix what isnt broken!!! Now its 3/19/2020 and its doing it again after doing your app update. All i get is a circle in the middle of the screen going around. No other apps have that problem!!! You need an update to fix the update!!! 3/20/2020, I still cant watch Y&R!!!! I get circle going around in middle of screen! It stops for a second, cant understand to 2 words."

It the application was opened, it basically takes you too it, but if not, absolutely nothing happens. Direct share works with other apps, though!",
      "What's wrong whith this app?! Messages can't be sent on my screen, while others see my messages and it doesn't showing me that. My messages are sent but not delivered or seen. And my chat list isn't loading. It happens to me every day and resetting end reinstalling isn't working. Fix this Facebook. It's annoying. 🙄 It started 3-4 weeks ago.",
      "Text works great. But when I call people it seems like the voice and video calls don't always work here in Cleburne TX. When I call people on the other side of the world it works fine but here in my town the calls don't always go through or get dropped or bad quality. Maybe the internet availability needs improvement in my town.",
      "Messenger recent update is bugged and I have tested it already on all 3 devices of mine, both android and iOS. Whenever I am trying to share something through messenger (be it a YouTube video, a photo, or an audio clip I have recorded in my phone's internal app), it will only pull up the Messenger app as if I am not sharing anything!!",
      "messenger sucks anymore.....have not been able to share and send articles to my friends as I did before, by clicking on share, then messenger and then name used to come up and I would click send next to their name, but will not and has not done for three going on four days today and do not know why! Is there something wrong with messenger? Can you please fix this problem and asap, thanks!"

      "At first, it seemed like a really fun, cool app with tons of free features. Then it began having issues. Half the time, my settings won't load and my profile won't refresh. The microphone randomly cut off and never came back on even after an hour of waiting. They're constantly bombarding you to pay for a pro version. Why would I do that when the app seems like it's still in beta with all the constant errors? I'll likely be uninstalling.",
      "The app works great and at first I loved it. As it gets more difficult (which it should), the loss of hearts is irritating. Hearts are essentially the number of mistakes you are allowed. If you run out of hearts, you can't do anything with the app for hours. You can get more hearts with gems, but they run out too. The only way around this is to pay for the premium edition and poof..... the \"free\" app isn't free anymore.",
      "Feels like a video game. It was great after I figured out how to turn off sound effects. The speaking exercises are pretty buggy. The app always thinks I'm done talking if you pause for more than half a second. The app will say that I got it wrong because I failed to say the rest of the words. I was getting to them! Can I breathe for half a second between words? I want to learn how to speak by sounding out the words slowly, but Duolingo won't let me do that :-(",
      "There are plethora of languages to learn and the approach is natural, progress is easy. However, a few cons : not enough audio of sentences, and most are of poor quality. Example in Vietnamese when the woman speaks, sound is terrible. It would be better if on the tablet the text blocks were bigger. Also, the new heart system makes the app really useless for too long. It was better before. Those who cannot afford to pay will just end up losing interest.",
      "Great app! I would love it if they would add a course for English speakers to learn Thai though. Also, once you complete a language it would be cool if you could re-activate the checkpoints so you could keep raising your levels, but without having to do each lesson individually. Finally, I would love to have the Groups/Clubs feature brought back. The social aspect of the app is really lacking. Overall though, it is my favorite language app so far."

      "The \"Watch\" tab does not work. I am logged into my television subscription through the ESPN app. But I get the dreaded spinning wheel indefinitely. This used to work many months ago. I cannot find an answer as to what changed. The rest of the app works fine for regular sports news to read. But the video \"Watch\" tab is a big letdown.",
      "Tech nightmare. Half the time, I click on videos and they never play. It's like I'm not even clicking on the video. You can still scroll though the categories and everything but when you click on a video it doesn't play, it stays on the main menu. The streaming is inconsistent even on wifi. Video plays for about 1 minute then buffers for 30 seconds then plays again. This happens about 1/3 of the time I try to watch or stream anything on the ESPN+ side.",
      "I detested the idea of paying for cable and an additional sub to the content provider itself. Reluctantly, bit the bullet and subscribed. After a few docs there appeared to be a noticeable delay between the video/audio on mobile devices. Saw reviews that ESPN ignores issues/feedback reported. Sent them a message anyway. Of course the generic response back, 'Were aware of the issue and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible' ...any chance it gets fixed before I cancel?",
      "Can use more upgrades and better features. Doesn't contain a dark mode and some links are suspect after you open it. Reduce the ad content, its overkill. And Autoplay videos can burn through your data like a wildfire. ESPN is a flagship sports network, how about doing the same for the app. 🤔🤔🤔",
      "I don't know if it's just my phone or if the app sucks, but i have had problems with using this app over 2 phones. Extremely slow and laggy, don't expect to be able to scroll well at all. Also takes forever to open the app and notifications, and can't open videos that have a notifications. The only reason it gets 3 stars is because it does have good content and it's a great app when it works, but very buggy and poorly designed."

      "I love the app's content, but find certain aspects of the UI to be frustrating. Definitely needs a search function and I can't understand why this hasn't already been resolved. It is hard to find the things I know I've saved and they seem to disappear completely at times. This leads me to be more anxious and frustrated as I sometimes search for ages for a specific story, meditation, or class and then ultimately give up using the app or just pick something that I can't fully delve into.",
      "This is one of the most well-done and educational apps I have come across, and I have been so helped by the guidance and the less guidance etc variety of selections they have. Do yourself a favor and get it. I want to give it a five; however, the user interface could be organized a bit better and there are sometimes (often enough to be stressful) glitches in audio cutting out. It would be great to not only have fav meditations but also be able to organize a \"my library\" of fav series w/ folders",
      "The enormous selection of content (music, sleep stories, meditations, etc.) allow me to remain calm and comfortable throughout my daily routine. I suffer from social anxiety disorder and in my short time of using Calm, I have found the content to be extremely helpful. I was recently told that I will be the Master of Ceremonies for my friend's promotion to Technical Sergeant in the USAF. I am hoping that practicing the content here will apply to this situation and that I get through it.",
      "Beautiful sounds and songs. However you're locked out of almost all meaningful guided meditations, or relaxing stories unless you pay a subscription. The music is beautiful and I used it frequently, I just feel there's plenty of apps I can get the same from, for free. If this offered more free options then I might change my opinion, and rating.",
      "I am on the 7 day free trial of the app and have cancelled my subscription (although from reading previous reviews I suspect I will be charged for a year now anyway). I wouldn't recommend this app - there are stories, music, relaxing scenery and meditations but there's nothing that unique that I think it justifies any sort of charge. All of the things this app offers can be found elsewhere online for free."

UPDATE - response asking me to email is pointless if you don't respond to my 2 attempts to contact you that way...",

It said it couldn't refresh, so I deleted the app and reinstalled and now I cant login at all. Has been going on for about a week now and it sucks because I have subscription I've paid for... but cant use. Would be nice to have this resolved and have some kind of compensation for it. It sucks paying for a subscription and not being able to use it.. hopefully this gets resolved soon",

The setting to back up messages should be automatically enabled and the messages shouldn't delete. All in all great app and easy to use.",

I noticed that there was an automatic update done 3 hours ago which may be the cause of it. So, I cannot login or refresh the app at all. Is anyone else experiencing this? It's a bit frustrating as I do not want to lose my chats and whatnot. Can Devs do something about this please?",

      "Very comfortable dating app. The swipe system is easy to use, and the application itself is not buggy, it works quickly. Excellent and high-quality filters - shows everything correctly. It’s also a positive point that Hily is absolutely free. I activated the subscription, and personally, I really like everything. I would recommend this application to all my friends.",
      "You pay for things that are standard with all the other apps and its not as functional so I don't see why anyone would pay for it. It also keeps switching the distance parameters to max every couple minutes so my matches are on the other side of the country, not super helpful. Plus when i change it back, it doesn't seem to impact the results anyways.",
      "Do not use this app! I installed it out of curiosity, and after seeing that there was no one in there, wanted out. However, they do not let you delete your account, let alone remove your data (photo). When talking to support, instead of showing me how to delete the account (spoiler alert: you can't), the agent banned me! Therefore I assume they still have my data and they'll using it to inflate their numbers, maybe for a fake profile? Is there any other way I can effectively report this?",
      "This app encourages third party to sell your data! My account got banned, and this is my first time ever got banned in all of my dating profile on multiple platforms. I have no idea why so I contacted the support. They asked me if I was using the VPN. Of course, I was, and said yes. They reactivate my profile. And got banned again a few mins later. I contacted the support, and they blame me for using the VPN. Hily wants ISP and third parties to get your data. Don't care about customers at all!!",
      "A well-developed dating app is Hily. A friend advised me of this application a week ago, and I decided to test it. Since I have personal experience as an application developer, I can say that the design and interface are lovely and professional. Also features, there are not so many of them, but they act and help a lot. I also like that there are very detailed filters - you can find exactly who you are looking for. Excellent!"

      "Worked perfectly at first, now it glitches ALL THE TIME! It used to keep accurate location, trips, and trip speed. Now it's all over the place, the trip speed rarely works, and location is highly inaccurate. I've checked for updates, checked settings to be sure all permissions were allowed and it still doesn't work right for any of our circle members. I suspect because I have the free version and they want me to spend $7.99 a month for it to work the way it should.",
      "It used to work good, but the last week or so its been crashing and freezing and also refusing to alert me when people leave their locations. Presently its showing me inaccurate locations for people. Shows people several feet away from where they are actually located moving, when they are not actually moving. I have even seen my own icon moving around when I know for a fact I'm sitting in my home in one spot with my phone in my hand. I've checked all settings for my phone and their phones, I've done steps listed in the FAQ's. Of course some robotic response will respond to this and tell me its on my end (always blame the user) but I believe this is an app glitch.",
      "It's very good at telling me my movements but doesn't work very well with my son's older iphone. Has so far only correctly shown me where he is twice. I have to rely on old school text messaging. Found the problem under FAQs. Life360 needs to use mobile data, which my son barely has any of, rendering this app pointless. Uninstalling.",
      "It used to work great when I first installed it. Now GPS is always offline when it isn't. How can you depend on this to track a family member? updated post: Well they fixed it temporarily after my post. However, a few days later and we're back to the same problem - asking you to send text msg to other person to turn on location permission when it's already on.",
      "Ever since the new update a few weeks ago my Life360 app and my son's app don't work at all. It always says that we are arriving and coming home at random times throughout the day. And it also is not accurate with the location at all. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it. I've tried turning on the Wi-Fi and turning off the Wi-Fi and then turning it back on I've turned off the location and then turned it back on. Nothing seems to work. I'm getting really sick of it."

      "Its meh, it has about 10 ads per episode, but they are at the very beginning and at the end, 5 at the start 5 at the end, so it's not that bad. Where else are you gonna watch anime for free? But my worst complaint is the buffering, it buffers like once every 2 or 3 minutes, and it takes around 10 seconds in total to stop. And I have pretty good internet. But if it wasn't that frequent or didnt exist, then I would very easily rate it 4 or 5 stars.",
      "I really like this streaming service, but on the phone app it is filled with issues. But my major problem is that it takes so damn long to load and still when it loads sometimes it stops in the middle of an episode, or the video stops and the audio goes back a few seconds and you have to wait for the audio to catch up. And in pc you have none of these problems, so I always keep thinking, why pay for this since you can just go on pc and use an adblocker. I am really frustrated with this app.",
      "The app really has a problem. Whenever I click on any video, the app tells me that its stopped working and that I need to reload. I've uninstalled and installed the app multiple times and the problem still won't go away. I really want to watch anime when I'm not at home but can't because Crunchyroll has \"stopped working\". I'm not even going to try anymore. Maybe get that fixed, please. However, this is a great place to watch all of your favorites for free and you get new episodes really quick :)",
      "I enjoy the app for the most part and I love the selection. Although I cannot go a single day without there being constant loading and buffering issues. There are apps like the Netflix one that I've never had an issue with, but does the same thing as this one... stream shows. It baffles me as to how this problem has yet to be fixed after reading so many others who also have this issue. I just want to be able to watch my shows without it constantly stopping and starting. First world problems aye.",
      "Nice app...when you actually get to watch it. Ads in a free version are fine, when they work. A 25 sexond ad takes about 2 minutes as it buffers constantly. Some ads run fine. Some of them need me to restart the episode as they just don't play. It's not every ad by the way. The figurine site ad works fine, but the insurance one freezes at about the 6 second mark for example. Pretty sure it isn't my connection as well. Otherwise the app works as intended."

      "When I top up the credit the money was delayed and when I tried to press the button it actually move straight away resulting in one waste of chance. Too much lagging issue. Claw does not move and the price per game is too expensive. not recommended. Help page doesn't really do what it needs to. Free play ticket is pretty useless as most of the games cannot play, and the terms did not mention how to use it. Overall very bad experience.",
      "EDITED When I first started this app it was really fun, and there was a nice balance between hard and easy machines. Now all the claws do is lightly nudge items. I'm giving this a one star rating, not because they've raised the difficulties on machines. But because I've had a charge issue, I've been emailing support for the last month and a half with no response to help me. All they did was set my account to -50,000tp so I can no longer play. But without any reason why, and not one email back.",
      "This game is very difficult. The claws are super tricky to figure out and generally are very weak. Most of the prizes are hard to actually win and will take more than 2-3 tries to actually get. That being said, the game gives you tons of free plays which helps learn the cranes, and winning is possible. Patience is the key here, watch other players try, and learn where the claws have their strengths.",
      "Overpriced gameplay. I can get play this outside for 1/3 of the price and have a confirmed official plushie if I spend 50 or more in the arcade. (Singapore) Also rigged gameplay. I witnessed and watched someone who pushed the prize to the edge which only require 1 more try to drop it down then SUDDENLY that particular claw machine is up for maintenance. Also they are using transparent hard plastic around the drop zone to make the drop harder making the prize bounce back. (looking carefully)",
      "While I enjoy challenges, the way these are set up are so difficult it's nearly impossible to ever win anything, making it become less and less enjoyable to play until now after having this only a few months I look at it and think why bother? There are better ways to waste your money than this."

      "I have had Fitbit devices since 2015 and love them. However, for the better part of this month I haven't had access to my Versa because it won't sync with my Google Pixel 3 phone! It had been fine but suddenly stopped syncing. I have just discovered that it wasn't just me and my phone/Fitbit, but this is a widespread problem. I NEED HELP. I went through the regular channels but they just kept telling me to do what I have already done. My phone is not recognizing my Fitbit. I have deleted and then reinstalled but now it won't let me do that. In the meantime I misplaced my charger (I bought a new one and now have 2!) so my Versa tells me it is 8:08 a.m. March 14, when in reality it is 11:33 p.m. March 22. It's really not pretty enough to pass as a bracelet, and I want it to track my steps........",
      "UPDATE: I followed the instructions and now it's worse. It worked for approx 24 hours, then all of a sudden lots of vibrations and my screen blank. I assumed the battery was dead, but it's been charging for 2 days and nothing , even after rebooting. My fitbit is 2 yrs old and just stopped tracking everything with the most recent upgrade to this app. It's been nearly 2 weeks now. Is this the lifespan of a Versa? My watch, nor the app work any more. The only thing is good for is telling the time.",
      "I loved my Fitbit Charge 3 when it was new. Now a couple of years later, I felt a vibration similar to when I reach my steps goal. I looked at the screen and it was dark. Black. Off. Nada. Nothing This was a few days ago. I have charged for a couple of days. Still nothing. It will not work. I have read of others having the same experience. Does this mean the watch is dead after only 24 months or less? This is not acceptable. I do not recommend Fitbit Charge 3 and I will not buy another Fitbit product.",
      "Fitbit will not sync. I have tried all troubleshooting methods, I have exhausted all options. Had it less than a month and it's garbage. Edit: the only way I was able to (hopefully) fix this problem, was to uninstall and reinstall the app. As stated before, I tried every other troubleshooting method prior to no avail. Second edit: no longer synching again. I'm trying to set an alarm and the dumb thing WILL NOT SYNCH."

      "This app has changed my life. I know that sounds extreme, but it truly has. I have depended on these meditations every night to sleep, and every morning. Especially during covid19...I think headspace is keeping me sane! I think it'd be cool if I could choose a set, like meditation, sleep cast, sleep music, to play automatically so I don't have to look at my bright screen. That's my ONLY idea to better this already amazing app!",
      "This is the best app for meditation. I love Andy's soothing voice, the fun and cute animations, exercises and courses asking with how light hearted Andy is when guiding you through each. I also appreciate the personalized \"Headspace recommends\" and the customer service can't be beat!! I have only experienced two glitches so far, but the Team fixed both within 48 hours!",
      "Very helpful. If it would be a free app then definitely It would take 5 star. But still nice app to meditate. I would recommend Headspace to free the basic lessons or at least till basic 2.I want to use the basics 3 of Headspace. Recently I come to know about free trail Of Headspace which Is purely useless for me bcz I have no any payment option . If you are giving free trail then give it free if i had any payment options to pay then what will be the need of using free trail.",
      "I was excited for this app. Kinda disappointed I can see the appeal but there is on back ground noise when the people talk which makes it sound weird, to me at least. You had to have a subscription for most of the recordings, would rather listen to Michel Sealy than pay.",
      "Edit: I uninstalled the app because I can't even log in anymore. I was really enjoying the sleep casts, but I tried to use one today and now I have to pay for them. I don't have any money so now I can't use the few parts of this app that were free up until today. Sucks that I was getting used to using them to help me sleep and now I can't. Edit: apparently I can still use 2 of the Sleepcasts, but my favorite 3 that I was using almost every night aren't available to me anymore."

      "Nice concept/different set up and cool prompts but ultimately disappointing. I don't want just to get matches & likes. Like other apps you can't make a connection that lasts than longer than a few minutes before all the sudden they stop responding. I'm a firm believer in \"other fishies in the sea\", but not when there's a limit of like ten you can try for, who end up not even responding. You guys were right on one thing on your commercial. This app will be deleted, just not useful.",
      "Literally just a better experience than any other app, especially for a person of color. Only critique is that the premium experience doesn't seem to offer that much on the surface, which is fine with me. The free version is perfect. They should have a donate button and maybe a \"found love\" option when people find a relationship and wanna delete the app",
      "Of course it's a bit difficult to find people on here that you click with, but that's just the reality of dating these days. In terms of dating apps, I think this might be the best one. The way the profiles are set up puts more emphasis on the actual profile, instead of just the pictures. That way you're not just swiping at eye candy. Maybe I'm just biased because I get more matches here than on tinder, but I like this app a lot.",
      "This one is hard to rate due to the pros and cons. Pros: very easy-to-use interface, appears to be genuine users and not fake profiles, known for people looking for long-term dating, reliable with notifications assuming your settings are set correctly on your phone, various prompts that are fun to answer, and requires 6 pictures to even start liking other users' profiles. Cons: profiles feel limited with only allowing you to write 3 short sections to answer prompts, unable to write long introduction messages to users after liking something about their profile, only available as a phone app and not a website to use on your computer, only shows city/town you live in not the state (which is hard since I live near a state border), when un-matching a user you are required to answer why you don't like the user but most answers are regarding sexual harassment or abuse (which is a scary thought) and not related to attributes related to the user. A few other things I cannot think of at the moment. Again, good app, but I haven't found anyone yet. Just wish there was more prompts you could answer than just 3 written answers so you can get to know the person a little better by their profile.",
      "Every time I start the app, it shows me the same profiles in the same order. I can go through 200 unique profiles, and the next time I open the app, I will have the exact same experience. Say I'm short on time and only swipe on 10 profiles. Next time I come back, I'll see those exact same 10 profiles, even though I have them all blocked."

      "Amazing game- but, I get kicked out a lot. Also, whenever I buy credits, I never get them. I've wasted money on this game thinking I'd get something out of it. Please fix this, I know everyone is working hard. But when you can, please fix this glitch or bug or whatever it is. I love your game, I really do. When things get fixed I'll update my review.",
      "The game Is really great but there's honestly a issue. So there's this thing called \"discovery\" and most players are mobile players but if you look at the photos you can tell that they're pc players. This gets on my nerves because us mobiles try our best to get on discovery but we just can't sometimes. My wish is if you guys could put more mobile players on discovery or make two categories. One side mobile the other pc. Love the game, though. :)",
      "So it was AMAZING until it logged me out and when I tried to log back in it didn't work. So I exited the app and waited. But then, it kept doing the same thing over and over again until I had to create a new account. But then it logged me out of THAT one and when I tried to go back in it said \"service unknown error\".",
      "My IMVU keeps logging me out and even if I'm on Wi-Fi I try to reopen it, all it says is that it can't load right now try again later. So I do and it still says it over and over. I love the game, don't get me wrong but I'm about to uninstall tge app if it keeps happening over and over. It has happend 7 times now.",
      "I love this game, its super fun to play! I met a lot of people. But, I tried to log in into my account, It said too many attempts even though I tried only ONCE. Also, when I tried to delete my account it would take me to the log in thing and it would say that my password is wrong. I only use 2 passwords and I tried both of them but it still said that it's wrong."

      "Fantastic library but a terrible UI and poor design make finding anything unnecessarily difficult. Everything is buried under confusing arbitrary menus and frequent crashes and connection issues are frustrating. I'm not sure how they even put out such a poorly designed app in this day and age. Other than being a messy cluttered unorganized disaster the comics themselves look amazing and the panels are easy to navigate. Edited to one star because the download function doesn't even work.",
      "This app eats through data like krazy. Even with streaming and downloads set to SD, the app just chewed through 12GB's of data in the last 5 hours. Plus the downloads don't even work. Anything I download won't play after the first few minutes, it'll just stop playing, and the support page I'm sent to isn't any help at all. Really wish they would fix this app.",
      "It's a great app, but the search engine and browser categories could be better. Seem like they remove some of the movies. I feel like all the movies and animated series should be at my disposal. Paying $75/year, the app should be much more better than what it is.",

      "I was very disappointed to see the lack of DC animation movies. They have some but nowhere near of what's in their library. I subscribed to watch Harley Quinn, which was great, but not being able to watch the recent JL animation movies that came out in the last 10 years made me unsubscribe."

      "Great app when it works. But it has bugs. When something goes wrong they have no idea hiw to fix it. I actually had customer service tell me to turn detection off. SERIOUSLY. The canned response to this review was not helpful. I emailed three times, called and nothing. Again, great app when it works. But when it doesn't you can't get much help.",
      "App works well, unfortunately it's not terribly accurate for me. It doesn't offer any controls for when to trigger automated tracking. This means if I'm a passenger in another car, it's creating logs that have to be edited or deleted. I wish they would add the ability to trigger automated tracking when the device connects to Bluetooth. This would give me the ability to more accurately track miles when I'm actually driving my vehicle.",
      "Does not allow you toggle off auto drive detection without constantly giving a notification and attempting to \"open a chat\" if you. The reason this is annoying is the app will constantly try and update your location causing other apps to fail even when you aren't moving. It's also useless for uber since it mixes half your rides together into blobs of random drives. This app needs some work. If you dont drive much this app will work for you fine. Kinda defeats the point though right?",
      "Used to be great, but the past several months, it has trouble detecting my drives so I miss a lot. A competitors app does not have that problem. I reinstalled and followed instructions on fixing this but it doesn't work. Until this is fixed, I won't be subscribing anymore.",
      "This mileage tracker is perfect for small businesses that have travel expenses. I have had this for over 2 years and absolutely swear by it. Sometimes I have to add drives but very rarely. Usually it's because my phone was rebooting or an update shut off my settings. Not often enough to be a bother. I highly recommend for business with travel."

      "This app used to be the best when it came to mobile editing. But i have no idea what the hell is wrong with this app from a certain time. The new update is surely a big mess. I am unable to edit a single photo, apply a single effect. Every time after choosing a picture to edit, it just restarts again and again. Fix this guys, and make this app great again !!",
      "I used to love this app so so much and it still is amazing. I just personally don't need a lot of these new tools introduced last year. If you want to go wild and creative then sure they are pretty exciting! I just don't need them and still am restricted by them and the need to pay. I wanted to save a project I was working on and couldn't unless I paid a subscription. Great app, just be aware of the penetrating demand for you to subscribe. (Still, love it lots, thank you!)",
      "I've had this app for a while now and it was working great. I loved the options I had, but recently this app has gotten so bad. Whenever I go to edit it glitches out after EVERY click I make. It's so annoying/frustrating that I'm almost done with this app. This bugging out constantly has pushed my patience to it's limit and if it doesn't get fixed soon I'm uninstalling. I've updated it and it hasn't fixed anything. Please fix this because it's an overall good app that I want to keep using.",
      "No free part, EXPEN$$$IVE paid. Actually, no, it's not a free app. I tried to add text and save my picture, but there was no save option, only a 3 day free trial that requires me to sign up, probably give credit card information, spend 10 minutes to save a picture. So, no free part, just use the free Photoshop app or VSCO, or anything. The paid app costs too much, and there is no free app.",
      "Great, even for a novice like me. One request: an ability to create a clickable link, preferably via a graphic image added to the picture. I usually put a small image of my social media accounts. It'd be great if the viewer could just click on the link to get to one of my accounts, especially if the picture has been copied and shared through other people's accounts."

      "I recently bought two parcels both in remote areas. A hunter showed me my property lines using this app. Now I have a bird's eye view of wildlife trails to get around on. I use it constantly to find landmarks (trees and boulders) near the property line overlays to find my edges. Can't live without it! Thanks for the great product.",
      "This app works pretty well most of the time but I bought the app so my hunting partners and I can share waypoints with each other. When they share waypoints with me, they come through 5-8miles off from the point they are sending. Most other features I've used have worked pretty well so far. Edit- the developers got back to me quickly and were able to troubleshoot the problem. Great app",
      "In general a great app, but it has bugs on Android phones which the developer promised to fix ,but has not. For instance, if you tap on a particular parcel to see its boundries it brings up many other green lines showing the boundaries of surrounding properties or just random lines that mean nothing. It renders that important part of the app useless on Android phones. They have promptly fixed the problem.",
      "Worked great the first couple of time I used it so I upgraded to my state's premium so scout some public land. But as soon as I started adding a decent number if waypoints and photos the app kept crashing, not syncing between devices, and severe lag. Their tech team told me they are working on a fix but it's been 3 weeks now.",
      "So I'm writing a second review since I cant reply to your response. I did contact your company. I was told in a year or so. It might be fixed. Here's my question that I asked your help department. Why when you have a program that has picture and GPS functionality does your error reporting page NOT allow you to use these tools to report errors. Instead asking for a written description of the \"issue\". I can hike and photograph boundaries much easier than I can write you a verbal description?"

      "This app sucks. It doesnt load properlly. They charge $20 to promote your items, every body asks for what your selling at a dirt cheap price. When ever somebody says they want to purchase some thing at a resonable price, the messages disappear when you log in. By the time an item sells, your practically having to give your item away. Probably the apps algorithm. It's done the same thing twice.",
      "Update: app sucks. When not let me in and keeps giving me an error code. So tired of this inconsistency and being locked out. SNAP!! it locks you out of your messages and then asks you to register as if you don't have an account. I've only been using this for about six months and it's already happened three times. Can't reply to people's messages. Missed sales. very frustrating. Not sure why they aren't fixing this problem because according to other people it's been going on a long time",
      "No support on bugs at all. I do not get audio notifications for items I'm selling. example: a person messages me wanting to buy an item, I see it FOUR HOURS later. response .metrics/times are way up to an hour because of this bug. could have lost the sale and look like a clown for not responding when OFFERUP NEVER NOTIFIED ME. What's up guys? This sucks. Update: There literally is NO support. Just random comments trying to look like they are actively doing something. they definitely aren't",
      "The app works well for the most part and does have some consistently great deals. After their last update I had to reinstall the app in order to do a new post, which has me a bit concerned on their regression testing process. Just an annoyance, I would still recommend folks trying it out.",
      "Seems like it could have been a good marketplace with good deals but you can't actually buy anything. Sellers just never respond to even full price offers or worse accept then cancel the sale. Days or even weeks wasted. Unreliable or inactive sellers/listings need to be removed. Too frustrating as is, uninstalled."

      "For how much it costs, it should work better. I've tried on 3 different devices now, and if I do it with the video function, the audio is garbage. I've tried it on WiFi, mobile network, directly plugged into an internet connection and it's still crackly and choppy, freezes up. I also run into the issue where a song I've selected will say it's 4 minutes long, but anywhere from 20 seconds to 3 minutes in will just suddenly cut off and end the song. Not worth what they charge.",
      "Once I got this app it was working perfectly!! I immediately fell in love with the game... but recently.. when I am singing.. the line doesn't move or the dots at the side don't move and i can't hear myself even with voice feedback on PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!! (or else I will have to go back to watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine 24/7)",
      "One thing I can say about this. WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE!!. Seriously, its £100 for a year and £10 for A WEEK what kind of ridiculous are they. Its stupid how big the prices are for a singing app. The only thing VIP gives you is you can do songs by yourself and make songs that people can join in on. That should be free anyway. I have no idea why its £100 for a year. Its stupid. If you want to make more money. Decrease your prices because I know people wont buy VIP. Especially kids who can't afford",
      "Excellent and I expected nothing less than such a good app. The only problem I have which I don't clearly understand is that in Xiaomi the audio while recording have small interruptions , but in Nokia 3 everything is fine. How is it possible for a Xiaomi that has better quality in many ways than Nokia 3 actually has some issues ? Is it because of my devices?",
      "Good, but sucks on Android. I used it on an iPhone years back and it worked perfectly. I switched to Android, but it's not the same. My biggest issue is my mic feedback won't sync with the music in real time, so I can't hear myself when I sing. And it clips causing glitchy audio, vocals don't sync when I'm done with a song so constant post-production fiddling, etc. Been waiting a while for a fix, but nothing. Bottom line, if you're considering a subscription then do it with an apple phone."

You really need to buy coins that cost you too much if you want to read, there is no other way! . So guys, prepare your credit card. Gonna find another app!!",
      "I would have given this 5 stars but the recent update is very annoying. Spirit stones were better, I could actually save some to read some other chapter, which cannot be done with the fast pass. Also, I had some coins but I never got to actually use them to read locked chapters. Now another problem is that I am not able to log in into my already existing account. And when I use the same mail id to log in, it automatically creates new account. Please resolve this issue.",
      "I don't think it is only me but I am not getting daily coins and have no way of getting coins except from if i buy them. Now I can only read a few chapters everyday I really liked this app before but now I am starting to dislike it. It doesn't make sense to me why a book app would do this. I also hate that coins expire. The update was only for their own benefit because they are forcing us to spend a lot of money if we want to continue to read. I do not recommend this app to anyone at all.",
      "I love the stories and comics! I can't wait to finish the ones I've been reading. Really good way to pass the time and enjoyable for lovers of reading, like myself. Four stars, however, because of the whole Fast Pass process. Makes for very slow reading unless you pay for more passes. But other than that, I recommend giving it a try. Woop!",
      "More and more I'm hating the app. Every update is just for their benefit. Forcing us to spend money in the app if we want to read more. The updates are not to improve the app. They are just to remove the benefits lectors have for free. I only downloaded the app because of one story and I was willing to spent money at the beginning to read faster (I did). But now they are forcing it so much that I dont want to. Ps. Moving to a different app or a web. This is not worth it. I'll read it elsewhere"

      "I have been using QuickBooks for a year now, it is ok , you can follow your expenses and have all organised when the app is working properly. In my case, recently the transaction function does not record all data from my bank for the last month , is the second time this happens. Also they make it so difficult to get human help , I have to spend half an hour goin through the AI questions to get the help I need. Not really reliable when you have to check expenses continuously.",
      "If you get a new phone you start from ZERO . Unlike other receipt keepers. That's super problematic and makes this make all effectively useless. Glad I changed phones earlier in the year rather than later when I may have had months of receipts to try to categorize. Pass on this app until it figures out a way to be able to transfer business rules, receipt saving and etc across multiple phones for a single email/account",
      "Today my phone (android) has installed the latest update as promissed. Problem is... it has changed all my \"milleage\" tab km to miles on my phone. ALL my logged km have automagically converted to miles eventhough it still shows in km. I cannot even, with some certainty, tell if the conversion is even accurately due to not having a back up log. What's going on with you guys?",
      "I would not suggest this paid app. If I could get my money back I would. The software kept increasing my expected tax payments every time I modified transactions to the point that my expected payment was 3 times my actual income. Pretty poor functionality for the most fundamental of purposes for this app.",
      "Update 3/10/2020 Wish I could get a refund. Customer service is non existent. The assistance they claim to provide me is the same as my last complaint. App is currently not accepting mileage updates when I select personal or business. App still shows wrong bank account information. They still deposit funds into the wrong account and have zero ways of changing the default account, or at least they've not provided me a means to change accounts. They also like to bombard you with TurboTax spam."

      "Great app. I have been using One Drive for about 6 years. In the last 18 months I have had to monitor One Drive very closely as every 3 days or so it decides to dump a ton of my files into the recycle bin. So I have to restore all the files and be very careful whenever I empty the recycle been. I lost some pretty important files when this first started occurring. I used to trust the program 100%, but ever since this started occurring I have been keeping my eyes out for a convienent time to move.",
      "Moving a file around/within a folder requires you to navigate from the root folder, each an every time. It is laborious and painstaking. Can't even cut/copy and paste a file, as there's currently no functionality to do this...PCs from decades ago could do this... Almost ironic; It's a file management and storage system, yet doing what it's fundamentally meant to is like wading through mud. Otherwise very good, and iteratively improving, albeit without fixing the above glaringly obvious problems.",
      "The only thing I would change about the app is to be able to choose which profile I want to be saving to when going to save things using 3rd party programs or other Microsoft products. Like I'll go to save a word doc onto my onedrive it goes to the last profile used instead of giving an option choose first. But that's a small thing and may just be personal.",
      "Good quick alternative for offline backups, with universally accessible features and contents. Recently found that there is a Dark Theme option as well. Thanks. Once it gave me 'Unusual Network Traffic...\" message, saying that my account may be blocked in 48 hours, although it didn't show which file was 'inappropriate' according to them. So don't rely on the Cloud too much. My account is active, but that message definitely upset me. I now type my Day Logs offline, and stick to offline backups.",
      "To download a file according to your help instructions you have to check off each individual file one by one. 20 + gigs of pics one by one is absolutely stupid and goes against any sort of time management plan. On my Computer with Microsoft operating system I can select all and transfer with two clicks of a mouse. One Drive can not be a Microsoft product as I believe Microsoft operating systems take time management into consideration. Massive failure from a time management perspective."

Cancel at the end of my billing cyle. It was supposed to be a 3 day free trial and as long as I cancelled I wouldn't be billed why should I be billed for something that's a hoax and doesn't do what its advertising it does ***DO NOT BUY",
      "I downloaded the app to see if the other users raited the app correctly and they did. I tapped free trial and then continue and then my phone froze. After a few minutes my screen told me to pick a payment method and then I couldn't get out of that screen even though I was pressing the x. This was NOT a good experience. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.",
      "Ad wouldn't close in another game i was playing. Every time i pushed the \"x\" to close this app's ad, it opened Playstore instead.",
      "Flat out hoax. Clearly made to get children to download and then out of frustration \"sign up\" past the blocking screens and thus get suckered into a subscription. Yes it does say it will cost after 3 FREE days. Here I wish I could make 'FREE' bigger and in bold font and make the 'it will cost' smaller and a light grey on a graphic background to ensure it cannot be seen or read... To devs and Google how about moving to a free trial WITHOUT automatic renewal. I propose this for ALL apps."

      "The mobile version of this app is frustrating. It's great when it decides to work but 95% of the time, the app wont load, when it does load and play a video, it is constantly freezing. It also will freeze and then skip back by itself and replay audio that has past and then start playing again just to freeze again. Can we please have someone look into this and actually fix it????!!!",
      "I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. The episodes. Don't play without glitches, if they play at all. One minute I can watch on my TV, the next I can't. Then there's the mobile app, which is a total loss. But what is REALLY effing annoying and weird, is that an episode is English dubbed one second, and Japanese subbed the next. And it happens, WHILE YOU'RE watching!!! I appreciate funimarion for providing fans with dub options, but the app is a disaster. And the website is even worse.",
      "App needs work. Clicking on things like \"recently add\" takes you to list that keeps refreshing when you get to the end. What looks like 100s of shows is really just the same 15 shows repeated again and again. Click on a show and going back takes you all the way to the top of the list. There is also video playback issues... forever to load, pause and can't continue. Want to go back or skip forward a few seconds, nope, video stops working. Overall just a poor UI. Also needs a night mode.",
      "This is my second review. I noticed you respond regularly to these however instead of \"talk to customer support\", \"sorry you're having a bad time.\" and shrugging off doing something about it put some effort into fixing the app or just take it down. You have all the clear consistent information you need to figure it out: laggy, freezes, slow, bad resolution ect. It's not us it's you and we would dearly love for you to fix it so we can actually enjoy the content you provide.",
      "I have this app on my phone, it's really awesome. I love it, but it won't let me subscribe even on the website, and I would like to. Sometimes when I go to a different page it's just blank, and I have to start all over. Not all the episodes of some anime are in English and I'm not really into reading subtitles so I have started some and don't finish. Other than that I deal with it and will continue watching, and trying to subscribe."

      "Love the stories! They grab me and hold me like only certain stories have ever in my life. There are some spelling and grammatical errors but nothing serious. The only thing that needs improvement is that the stories have holes in them. For example, in one story, 2 characters got married, an important part, but the wedding was not included, only details were added not the wedding ceremony itself. Also there was a very abrupt ending to one story almost like the author was forced to end it. Great!",
      "First story I read was very alluring, even though there were a lot of grammatical errors. No ads that I can see, which is great. But the disappointment comes as soon as you get into the story, you run out of the credits it takes to unlock the chapters. Apparently it takes 15 days to unlock. That is ridiculous. It will take you several months to read one book without purchasing any credits. Smh. I personally will not be purchasing any credits and will probably delete the app.",
      "My experience in using this app is quiet good but I'll rate only four stars because I am not satisfied. I don't think it's a good Idea that some episodes are locked and can only be unlocked with coins. Me as a reader, I feel to much excitement with the next episodes, but suddenly, get frustrated because the episodes are locked. And to be honest, if I am going to compare this app to wattpad? wattpad is way better than this one.",
      "Im in between on how i feel. I have two complaints. 1. Some books allow you to wait for pages to open and others you are forced to pay coins. We should have option for both on every chapter of every book. 2. Why does the amount of coins change for each chapter. 15 to 28. It should be one price only. 10 to 15 coins tops. APP needs to make these changes.",
      "I loved this app, I even just spent almost 20 dollars in two days. I could not access my account last night. I message the company, I can access my account now but all of the books I was reading are now back to the beginning. It didn't save my complete books. Now I have had this account for some time now and have spent about hundred dollars on the app. Well I guess I'm never getting another app like this. I suggest you don't waist your time."

      "I just noticed after I convinced myself to try the first 3 \"free\" days, if you dont cancel you'll get an automatic payment of $94.99 - for a full year subscription debited to your account. And with all thats going on im pretty sure getting a refund or in touch with any customer service will be in vain. Watch out!",
      "Horrible app. I feel sorry for people who believe in this stuff. It said I have poor health and that I need more cardio.... Had a yearly check up last week I'm in perfect health. I ride my bike everywhere, at least 40kms a day every day. It said I don't like my job and that I switch jobs often... I've had the same job for seven years and love it.. the only thing it got right was calling me a composer because I am. I did each test 3 times and got completely different results each time. Lmao scam",
      "After you installed this app, it'll require a monthly payment, unless you press free trial (which caught me by suprise), which I was pretty disappointed. Would make more sense if you pay first and then install the app like other apps do, or have it tell you in the description at least. Even though I gave this rating one star, my real rating would have been a half star (which wasn't a option). What a waste of time and space. So yeah, definitely DON'T install this app.",
      "This app is SUPER TRASH. It requires a monthly payment for a one time thing and you need to enter your credit card information for one time stuff. Also also... it's one of those apps which have a really annoying advertisement in game apps and stuff. Please don't download this app. I wasted my time on this so you don't have to.",
      "Poorly written explanations with many errors in typing and grammar. For a service that requires revolving payments it needs a lot of improvements. I was even unable to rate the app when the pop up, popped up. I had to back out of the page. Cancelling immediately, less than 10 minutes after installing."

      "Downloaded the app and compared to my girlfriend's UI... Completely different. Very confused about why we have different interfaces. Mine sucks- it's almost to the point of one of those over simplified newsboards. Couldn't find the search bar, sections aren't easily navigable (no side bar), poorly designed. Let me choose my interface!",
      "This app logs me out everytime I close it (sometimes even while I'm using it). It's hard to navigate and honestly not worth having if you have a subscription and can just get the same content online without all the hassle. It seems like an easy enough thing to fix, and you would think a company of this size would have the means to just fix it",
      "The app sucks. I have subscribed to the basic service using the phone credit but still cannot access it. After opening some articles, I was notified that I had reached the amount of articles I could read and later reminded to subscribe again to enjoy the basic service. What?! To make the case worse, I cannot get refunded as well. I love the NYT, but its app is simply unreliable. I'm terribly discouraged from attempting another purchase. The same thing might happen again.",
      "App is a good start but has room for improvement. I love when scrolling thru is interactive with the the content; its a nice touch. Wishlist: (1) morning brief should be available at the top of the page in the morning hours, and similarly the evening brief in the evening hours. (2) i want to pick what news i get notifications for (ex: turn off stocks, sports). (3) \"for you\" tab should let me pick categories the first time/for set up, but then just show me articles from those selections.",
      "Notifications do not work. Click on one and it takes you to a different article. Examine every article available, and the one they notified you about simply isn't available. None of the games with properly anymore. Vertex shuts down. Spelling Bee rockets off a string of letters you didn't even touch and has to be manually restarted. The crosswords don't refresh properly. The acrostic clues are truncated. Sad."

Now support just won't reply",

The app said I had to allow location permission in the settings which I did & when i logged in on my laptop I was told I had to verify my number on the app, I have already done this but currently can not get past the logo screen to try and do it again. I tried contacting support but no response. I was also not contacted to help when I couldn't get the Buzz feed in the app. Uninstall for good",

I closed the app down after making the profile and finished it and now it wont let me log back in as the Facebook alternative log in it will load the facebook screen and say loading. but then go away fast and still be on the login area for skout like what was the point of making the account for the Facebook area and then not 20 min later cant log in. Also I dont want to make 13 accounts just cuz one didnt work after."

      "Sometimes very good, has quiet a variety of good novels but a bit too short, the chapters are too short and sometimes too short to make sense when you compare the price you have to pay. I was trying to open the app on my laptop but its not working so i only have to access it on the phone and currently I dont have a phone, so how can one get the app on the laptop?",
      "Edit: I've changed my rating because nobody should have to spend $100 on a book I don't care how good it is. Even dealing with the unlock of a free episode has become ridiculous. Just when you've spent over 30 coins and you're nearing the impossible of reaching the unlocking episodes ever 6 hours which is a ridiculous amount of time when it only take about 5 minutes to read a chapter it resets to a higher number than before. I've wasted way to much money. My own stupidity but still.",
      "Great stories. Just too expensive for coins. And where is the option to buy said coins??? It's ridiculous that you have to wait 24 hours for the next page. That's longer than other similar apps. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone. Waste of time and money. Hopefully Radish will change it's app to make it more affordable and exciting to use in the near future",
      "Great variety of stories in different genres but it is expensive compared to other book subscription services and nearly impossible to get coins and read a book at a normal pace. It would work if you were following the release of chapters WITH the release but with stories that are complete or far ahead you have to pay more than the book is worth in coins to catch up. They need to offer an unlimited subscription service that is priced more competitive with Amazon Unlimited.",
      "Most of the chapters are to short to justify spending the kind of money you'd have to on a book. Honestly it's cheaper to buy a published book. $10 for a full length 30 chapter books.. This app has you paying $12 for 27 SHORT chapters. And some of these stories have like 100 \"chapters\" that's like $45 for a book on this app...... No. Just no."

      "Not a great app. The stories are cool, but you get to read 1-3 chapters before they start charging 3 tokens for each chapter. Their \"deal\" that they give to new readers is 5 dollars for 46 tokens which is only 15 chapters. As an alternative, there are points which you have to do \"actions\" for. Those actions are playing other games and getting to a certain point in them. Its 300 points for one chapter. If you want to use points, you'll be spending way more time on other apps than this one.",
      "I tried several other comic apps, and this is the best one. Their translations are accurate, and the titles they have available are some of the best ones out right now like \"who made me a princess\", \"abandoned empress\", \"emperors daughter\", and so much more. The interface is so clean too. I don't really care about the money part. I would rather pay than look at ads, and messy interface bc of the ads. Here i can pay $5.00 and read in peace.",
      "I really wish there's a new way to earn a free tokens or points, for example watching advertisment, or maybe a little mission like read a certain manga in a certain time. I really love this app because the mangas here are beautiful, i know that paying it, its worth but im worry about the people who doesn't have a coin, how they gonna read the manga they love if its locked? So please make a update version, and please someone agreed with me.",
      "Most of the reviews are accurate. There isn't much you can read for free before you have to spend money to continue reading a story. And out of the three stories I sampled, they all felt rushed; like some info was cut out and the rest pushed together. The chapters are also too short, like maybe a five paragraph essay's length. All in all, not worth spending money on. You'd come out better actually buying physical books.",
      "Easy to use and enjoy the stories, though agree there could be more variety of stories and that the token deals could be more of a deal. Still, gotta side-eye all the people complaining about cost. Five bucks gets you at least 13 chapters, which is basically a volume. Stop being greedy and support your content creators y'all."

      "An undeniably useful application. Great for photographing documents if you don't have a scanner. Can be a little slow to send those files, but still useful. I had a security scare recently that reminded me to delete sensitive documents when I'm done with them. I'd be careful in that regard, but I still recommend the app.",
      "Power packed app for scanning, OCR, format conversion, editing & sharing of documents. No other app comes close to it. Also really easy to use. Cons: pricings are quite steep for casual users Update: where's the recycle bin? If one accidentally deleted a page, only a message pops up informing they'll be kept for 30 days but you can't even find how to restore",
      "Exceptional tool to manage and edit documents! A must for every literate. The options to share in any format and different sizes, import pictures from gallery or other documents, crop and customize scanned documents in a variety of available options makes it awesome. Looking forward to learning more features. There are ads when opening and closing the application that might irritate, but that's nothing compared to the services provided for free. Plus, one is free to purchase premium :)",
      "Used this app long time ago for occasional use and need it once again for occasional use as well. Cant regain my old files i once had saved in the previous apps, they were IMPORTANT docs lost Even after doing the free trail still wont give access. This app is trash to me now. Its good for a one time use of a scan if need other than that its a no go. Waste of money for the $49.99.",
      "This app used to work fantastic but now it intentionally lower the quality so handwriting is no longer legible. That will not get me to buy the app. That will make me find a different app instead. Now I'll be spreading word-of-mouth about another app instead of yours. A lot of people have downloaded your app because I told him it was very good, you're welcome. Now you made a liar out of me by lowering the quality of the free app like morons. No more free advertising for you. Dumbasses."

    "comments":[
      "Doesn't deliver as advertised. First week of use, in trial period. All the robocalls tonight rang through and disturbed my peace. Only when I physically rejected a call did it go to the recorded answer. The caller was a collector I believe and he immediately got that it was a recording and disconnected the call so it did not fool anyone. When I tried to reach RoboKiller customer support thru the app, none of the links worked to do so. Very frustrating. [UPDATE] Has worked as advertised lately.",
      "Found that it did not recognize the calls that are actually bugging me (spoofed calls in mandarin). Was only able to block spoofed calls that was similar to my number where most are in the realm of 1-800... Etc. Cancelled after free trial. Only successfully blocked a call from my bank that I'm fairly sure was legitimate (to be confirmed). I liked that it transcribed voicemail messages, but like I said, most of them are in mandarin so... My visual assessment of the number was way more reliable.",
      "Works mostly as advertised. Surprised at the negative reviews here, haven't had trouble. Still, it doesn't waste as much scammer time as the marketing wants you to believe. I only get \"ring once\" or pre-recorded robocall scams that are \"press 1 to connect\" or make you call back a number. These aren't affected by the advertised \"hilarious\" Robokiller bots. Only the legit Dr's offices, uber drivers etc using non-whitelist numbers get the bots. I assume the real benefit is in the database.",
      "The app doesn't really work. I still get just as many spam calls as I did since I got it. What sucks is that the fix is to add a spam call to the list, but its just like me blocking the number only difference is now. They change the numbers like they always fo and the call still goes through. Im letting this month chatge after that Im uninstalling it",
      "Phone does ring twice then the app will pick up. There are a lot of answer bots to pick from. After the call is done you can listen to the phone cell. The app also stores your voice mails from your contacts."

    "comments":[
      "Tried many of these trail apps and this one has more trails listed than most, but it takes way too long for your \"completed\" & \"stats\" to update. It should be done immediately (and no it's not my cell service because i never had any issues with other apps in this regard). I see you went for quantity and not quality.",
      "This app is a great tool, not only to find trails around the world, but also, and in my opinion more importantly, accurately navigate your travels. Not all Trails are marked well, but with Allatrails you don't have to worry. Also the social aspect is a fun bonus to read real reviews on the journey on which you will embark.",
      "Once I am on the walk and tracking on GPS I love the app - even locally is taken me to places I wasn't aware of. However when I'm planning the walk I find the app counter intuitive. for example once you downloaded a map it's difficult to find it again, I've never worked out how to look at various layers. Some walks include a narrative with waypoints others do not.",
      "The app is amazing my only complant is that to use some of the more advanced map overlays like the terrain stuff on google maps, you need to pay for it. But you can find all sorts of trails and what not in the base app. I found so many off road car trails and the users can upload there trail photos so it makes for an amazing app for me. I've been looking for off road trials that are not the major rock crawling ones for months now, and i found them so damn quick. Would definitely recommend.",
      "UPD: Didn't help at all. App works really slow. Doesn't load my lists sometimies. Often doesn't update GPS coordinates unless I close and open map again. Doesn't load images (unless I go to Share menu). It was a good app, that's why I bought lifetime subscription. Now I'm thinking it was mistake. Pro maps do not worth it. Really dissapointed with direction you guys going :("

(1) Now, if I get a phone call, the audio for whatever I'm listening to when the call comes in pauses but then resumes several minutes later while the call is still in progress. Occasionally the call is dropped. (2) When I open the app, it no longer resumes what I was listening to most recently even though I have that setting enabled. (3) Constantly getting stream connection errors. Some days I have to just give up.",
      "A very important live news app. It is one of my most preferred app. before other similar app. A must download app. for anyone who wants to stay updated with live happenings around the world. I personally rate it five(5) stars plus. The developer of this Application, please keep improving on it's performance. Thanks.",
      "Looks pretty good. I uninstalled it at first as it looked like there was no way to use it for free. One bad thing I've noticed is that the mini player appearing in the drop down notification menu vanishes, especially if you go and look at a YouTube video or something. I'd rather it stay in the notification menu so I can restart the stream. It doesn't auto restart very well.",
      "This app is like a ticking time bomb in your phone. Without even opening the app, it just starts playing music at random times. You can't even shut it down because it doesn't show as a running app and continues to blast noise out during meetings or at 2am while you're trying to sleep. You have to reboot your phone to turn off the noise.",
      "*New update* Same issues I don't know what you guys did with the latest update but you screwed it up. It's extremely glitchy. The audio while paused is gone forever. The going forward or back 30 seconds now needs seconds of buffering and only goes back about a minute. It stops playing randomly and I have to press stop and then play. BRING BACK THE OLD WORKING VERSION!"

      "It's a great VPN, WHEN IT WORKS! More often than not in my experience it tries to connect to a server, rather than actually doing it... Sometimes its instant and I'm filled with glee, however, 90% of the time I'm relogging, trying different servers, and just hoping to SOMEDAY connect to one!! I've tried all alternative options in \"settings\" to no avail. This happens with the paid version, which is why I'm very dissapointed. DO NOT BUY; if you experience this as well through the free trail.",
      "NordVPN does not work with most streaming services. The company's position: \"accessibility to the streaming services is an extra feature and we do not guarantee that you will always be able to access it with no issues 24/7.\" Even though they advertise that they offer uninterrupted streaming. So you have to disconnect, then reconnect, every time you wish to stream. They will respond by saying you should contact customer service. 2 chats, 4 emails later (ID #5305367)no change. Time for a new VPN.",
      "Great VPN! If you are using on a Chromebook and you are using apps, then you need to install and activate the NordVPN app to be fully protected. There is a Chrome extension that protects the browser ONLY. It was easy to find the answer to this question on the FAQs by NordVPN. Some streaming services do not allow you to use their service (YouTube TV as of 3/2020) and NordVPN at the same time. Other apps that don't allow you to use NordVPN, also. I am concerned mostly about financial transactions.",
      "Not very user friendly, I had to figure out by myself and totally by chance that I have to use obfuscated connection to successfully connect without being blocked. There is no users' guide provided,would be cool though,with every scenario to troubleshoot.And it's not working on my android tv box, leaving me stuck to the 8\" tablet to watch movies. I'm not impressed. Tough luck that I got the 3 year subscription without testing the first year. The 3 stars would be for the price then.",
      "So far so good. Expressvpn has left me with a useless 6 month subscription in China. It just won't connect and is slow as a snail when it does once and hour. Nord connected quickly and is good so far. I wish I'd spent the money here first but I had good luck with the other last time. I'll keep both just in case now."

The online support was arrogant and and explained nothing. The links the 'support' send do not work. I was enjoying my time with the people I met on here, but that has all be wasted because of poor support from Taimi.",
      "I want to say that this app is amazing, because it's a really great app. However I find myself constantly frustrated by hangups in how it runs, I completly understand the restriction on an app like this when it comes to making money. This has led me to be confused by what features I can and cannot use as some times I can use a feature while other times I'm completely barred from them. I love the concept of the app and it does work well, it's just not very user friendly to those who cant pay.",
      "It's a good, friendly app with LOTS of features! I like that there's a newsfeed, video posting, groups you can join, add friends, etc. There are certain features (for unlimited use) you have to pay for which is understandable. I don't like that it notifies everytime someone views your profile. Why do I need to know who viewed my profile and decided not to \"like\" me? And why would I want every person instantly knowing I'm viewing their profile (especially when they're \"online\")... Awkward.",
      "Taimi is by far my favorite app nowadays. It's not the perfect app, naturally, but it's probably the best one in the Store currently. They can be a bit pushy with subscriptions at times but I've always been using it in the free version nevertheless, and I've been having a great time. So it's not a \"pay to play\" app. I absolutely recommend it!",
      "it's good and it feels quite safe. location isn't always precise, for example it happens frequently that users specify their location in their bios because the \"location setting\" indicates somewhere else. feels kind of weird to be asked about body hair when making the profile. chats are alright, people were kind and it's good to have some reveals accessible even if you're not paying. better than many others."

      "The app is great! Call quality and features are reliable and high quality. I love the customization options. The only thing I wish they could add for the android version of the app is the feature to change the main and message wallpaper. This feature is available on the iphone version of the app.",
      "I'm a subscriber for ~2 years. My experience was positive to start and has continued to get worse. Unfortunately, I don't recommend. Phone calls have delayed audio despite strong connection. I've communicated issues and they've persisted. Will update if that changes with this review.",
      "Good App..yet frustrating..helps out alot...but wheres the feature to delete more than 1 message...it either deletes 1 text message or them all...and also the quality of sending and receiving video and photo content are horrible...also why is there a whole other number showing up on my phone when someone calls me...i never know who is calling me",
      "Frustrating. Everything was great until today. I keep getting messages that say to keep your device mobile private open sideline app and call again. IM IN SIDELINE APP. I've reinstalled 3 times now",
      "I Have had Sideline for almost a year with no issues. I use this number for business, so it is critical. Because of a technical problem, my calls were suddenly going directly to my other numbers voicemail without ringing. I then had need to call customer service to get help. Let me tell you, it was an extraordinary experience. I was very impressed. Such real, personable, professional service ! In the end, Dominic had the whole thing corrected in less than an hour. Stellar performance !"

      "this app is painful to use. showtime needs to hire a UX designer who actually watches shows from an app. the search field is buried in a menu. If you add a show to your list, it's hard to access the full series so that you can watch/download new shows (you can only do this by finding the search field and searching for the show again). You can't add a series to your list, just individual episodes. When you're starting a new series it lists the episodes in reverse chronological order. I guess this makes sense if you've been watching the whole time and are just looking for new episodes, but for starting a new series (especially since you can only find episodes by starting with the search field), it's annoying to always start with the last season, and then have to scroll all the way to the end to get to the first episodes. wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so hard to get there in the first place. also, it's easy to forget this format (maybe it's just me), so frequently when i start a new series i'm starting with the last episode of the first season. I could go on but why bother. Its nice that you can download shows and watch when you're offline. app gets 1 extra star for that feature.",
      "Crashes every 5 minutes says\"playback interrupted\"Then makes me log in again. Once I sign back in I dont know where I left off, it wont show you either.You have to scroll through each episode to see where you left off. When it finally does play it says loading and lasts for 30 seconds or more every few minutes.The shows are great if you are ever able to actually watch them.Watch it through prime it's so much better, it doesnt crash and when you hit play it picks right back up where you left off.",
      "I am at my wit's end with this app, it says there isn't enough space on my phone to download episodes, despite having a ton of space left on my phone. The app will also randomly sign me out for no reason, and if I back out of the app to check a notification while I'm watching a show, 1 of 2 things happens:1. it actually plays with no errors, exactly where I left off in the show. 2. A playback error occurs and I have to restart the episode. Absolutely ridiculous.",
      "Horrible! Crashes all the time. Constantly buffers. When you come back to a show, it doesn't keep the place your left off. It doesn't even keep track what episode you are on! I have Netflix, hulu, Prime video, HBO and they all work great! Unlike Showtime!!",
      "The layout and the way this app functions needs ALOT of work. It cant even remember what episode you were watching you have to manually search for it and then select it. THEN if you go out of the app for any reason it cancels playback and you have to do the search all over again. Then before you watch anything it asks if you are sure you want to watch without using wifi... EVERY SINGLE TIME."

      "Connection to VPN disconnects every few minutes requiring user to relaunch the app to re-establish the connection. Very annoying when you want to continue browsing knowing the VPN will remain connected. To the best of my knowledge I have instructed my phone not to restrict the app and allow it to auto start. I have also enabled 'connect automatically' within the app itself. App also doesn't launch immediately, instead you have to look at s picture of a lighthouse?",
      "I will revise this review after I have had time to use it more and evaluate all aspects of it, but I strongly recommend using Norton antivirus and Norton Secure VPN, as well as most Norton products in general because it's been a solid, tried and true company for at least 40 years, (or as long as I've been alive.)",
      "Great for security I had the same issue others had on the trial broke down an paid for the subscription and it works totally opposite of the trial The security for transactions is completely different very secure I do not have every thing I look up follow me advertisers are not able to follow me. If you bank or use a trading platform or purchases you will see the difference. I was very skeptical. Glad I made the purchase and was able to buy a lifetime purchase norton AV for 5 devices with VPN.",
      "Update: 3/14/2020 - now no longer works at all, not able to \"set up Norton account\" can't even get into the program. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. Norton Mobile Security seems to work just fine...but this VPN app flat out doesn't work. I answer to developer comment, same problem either over my home wifi or cellular. Doesn't matter. Takes a LONG time to connect. Many times it NEVER connects. When it works, it seems to work well though...just very hit and miss.",
      "What a ridiculous and useless app. Unstable, and wouldn't connect. I assumed it was because I was using a limited version during the free trial. So then I went to cancel, which was insanely difficult and wound up being charged for something I can't use. Tryi g to request a refund from my phone on the mobile website put me into an endless loop of new tabs being opened, without ever being able to request my refund. This comes off like a scam, which is a shame considering the Norton reputation."

      "Wow, been using this app for years to listen to games in the past but after the updates during the off season it now eats up nearly 2 gigs of data for a game....DATA HOG. BEWARE.",
      "Purchased it last year and it worked great - so much so that I purchased a gift subscription for my cousin who is out of market for his favorite team. So far this year, not so much. It won't recognize my purchase; it will tell me I have already purchased, but will the go back to the purchase screen. I have done a force stop several times, and have uninstalled and installed at least a dozen times since the first game of preseason. Also having trouble with my Kindle Fire tablet and my Firestick app, as neither of those will recognize my purchase either - so it appears to be an MLB glitch. Hopefully they will fix it soon. Five stars last year; so far this year 2 stars for the aggravation. Please fix it soon!!!"

      "Couldn't speak more highly of this program. The content & material it provides is undeniably the best on the market, while being fun & engaging. I've never had any technical difficulties. I bought the full personal package a couple years ago & recently recieved a free upgrade to access all languages! It was already more than worth the purchase so I am very grateful. If you actually want to start learning a language or brush up on your skills you won't regret the purchase!",
      "When I tried to do spanish it kept telling me I was doing it wrong. I personally took spanish classes and was looking for more help. I don't think this app is really good with its audio. When I try to speak into the audio its always says \"Please move to a quiet place and speak slower\". I usually speak fast so uhhh don't know what to do then.",
      "I also had the message \"SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG\" but after trying many things all I did was delete the app. Shut off my tablet. Waited 2 mins and turned it back on to reinstall and that solved the problem. Hopefully this helps others. The App version is actually very easy to use and learn. I'm satisfied.",
      "Very happy to have all languages available and grateful that they updated my purchase with it without me having to do anything. App is fun and easy to use and it checks for the accent which is the main thing. Excited to learn French and later Tagalog, Italian, Hebrew, and all the other languages I've been wanting to learn!",
      "I haven't used it much, but this is clearly not the typical language learning app I'm used to. I finished the first core lesson and didn't hear or see a single word in English, but I'm definitely more confident in what I've learned here than anywhere else. It's interesting, and in the best way. I can't wait to keep learning. :)"

      "Awesome, I've had zero issues because I can read pretty well and all of the features/drawbacks are pretty well explained and fairly obvious. Haven't lost any photos and the cloud service has brought me through multiple phones. Would definitely recommend. I've had the premium sube for a few years now. $25 a year isn't much to support something you like.",
      "READ BEFORE YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!! Pictures I had saved, even from years ago on separate devices all got deleted. I know they synced because they had been saved for years most of them. There's nothing left now. Have spoken to Developers and Customer service. Told them the issue well over five times and have still been waiting hours for a response back. I suggest using a different app and boycotting this app before they lose all your pictures and play dumb afterwards.",
      "It never fails me but at times it clutters the files. When I access the individual files they don't follow the preview arrangement and others seem unnecessarily repeated! The database could be corrupting the arrangement or something like that. Otherwise, it's the best of it's kind. No competition.",
      "The app doesn't reveal any content in it as you open it and it hides all the saved pictures. Nothing is shown at all. Keeping on opening it and closing it back and forth for hours but didn't work. - EDIT - Just editted my review from 2 stars to 4 stars after the problem or the glitch resolved. I may not be too bitchy about it, just hoping not to lose my pics on this app.",
      "Do NOT download; boycot this app and any other app from this developer. They subscribe you to premium trial without your knowledge, when the trial period runs out, they hold your photos hostage in an effort to try to make you pay for the app. I had to delete an album with 3 photo that the app rendered inactive so I could not export them. The app gave me a pop-up telling to upgrade to premium else I will lose 4 fotos. I am NOT kidding you. Andmore frustration the app put you through try to expor"

      "It's very easy to navigate, it gives you plenty of matches based on your preferences. Something they can improve is once you have written to someone and they don't like you, you can't see your messages to those people. Maybe you can still save those. Messages just so you know who you have reached out to. Also, sometimes you can swipe no by mistake and you can't really go back and unswipe. Other that that pretty satisfied with how the app works.",
      "I have to say, I've tried Tinder, Bumble and Badoo (for Tinder I even paid for the gold subscription) and this was by far the best! Real profiles of amazing people, some of which with great detail, thanks partly to the supplied multiple choice question system. Better matches, fast and efficient filtering. Minimum wasted time. It's a great tool and I'm happy I paid for it! :) Although now with corona, it's kind of wasted money, but that's not the application's fault! 😂 Thanks for the good times!",
      "I love the fact, especially as a guy, that you can send an intro message with your likes to help you stand out and start a conversation. I think OKCupid has really come a long way in becoming one of the most user-friendly dating sites out there. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars, is that bumble and tender probably have more attractive women using them, but I think Cupid is also making progress on that front as well!",
      "I had the app before they had the \"Doubletake\" function and I feel that it was best the previous way since you were able to message directly. With the Doubletake, I feel like the app is useless like Tinder. I have so many people who swiped on me (and vice versa) but somehow they don't come out in Doubletake. If swiping just to pass time is ok with you then you'll have no issue with it. That's all it's good for.",
      "The app itself is great, I have enjoyed using it for years now. The customer service on the other hand is absolute trash. My account was stolen and they refused to respond to any of my many messages. If you have an issue you will be ignored, the best they were able to do for me was banning my account. And this was after months. As a paying customer I found this treatment excessively unfair. There are plenty of competing services with far better customer service."

      "The lessons are good but the servers of this app are non-existent. The video keeps on buffering after every 4 or 5 seconds even though others apps work smoothly with the same network connection. The same is true for the Udemy website. It becomes frustrating after a certain time and the excitement to learn vanishes. I kept waiting for an hour to watch a 16 minute lesson and wasn't able to complete it. It was either a problem with the lesson or the Udemy server. It keeps on buffering.",
      "Works great but facing problems while playing videos and opening pdf lessons of my course at times. The videos get stuck displaying a message telling me to play the videos from my computer instead. It isn't a connectivity issue. The pdfs simply refuse to open while the ones on my phone open as usual. Moreover, this app works well only on high speed connection. When connected to the WiFi the video playback speed drastically reduces. I hope the problems get resolved soon. Thank you Udemy",
      "Hello Udemy team, I have an issue regarding the screen resolution. I cannot watch the videos in full screen body ratio. The width of the videos are fixed to certain level. And we cannot even zoom. As you can see when I play a video in YouTube. I can get Full screen display ratio. It would be better user experience. If you update it to the full screen size ratio. and also great helpful for mobile user's. Please look into it and let me know. Thank you. Kind regards.",
      "Please can someone explain why my course downloading is not effective. Each time I try to download a new course, the downloading starts from a previous course that I've already completed before. Is there any way I can correct this? However I've been enjoying the use of this App, this download issue is my only challenge. Please assist.",
      "I like the app but there are a few glitches I am facing recently. They are, 1) Even after downloading the whole course I am unable to view it when my internet is turned off or my phone is in poor network zone. 2) Recently I have bought a new course but I am unable to make the course offline, the download button does not work. Hoping to hear on a resolution soon for you. Thanks & Regards, Kevin Rodrigues"

      "I hate to complain, because it might just be the best Word Processing app out there. But, there are innumerable problems with the interface - especially manipulating/dragging the cursor for editing. Also there are periodic discrepancies in template formatting, indentions, margins and paragraph spacing. All in all though, it gets the job done. And, as I said, it probably is the best mobile word processor out there. I'm sure that with time and updating the devs will get all of that fixed.",
      "Wonderful!!! It's more than wonderful this software has been a dream of mine for over twenty years I was first using Microsoft 98 word and word weaver. I think that was the name of the product that I had used. in my office supply and tool store. It was a really a good product back then. It really promoted my thoughts and ideas into a reality. Thank You. Office 365 is where it's at \" a good product \"",
      "This app seems to do most of what a desktop version of Word does. The trick is to figuring out what all of the little icons mean to do what you need to do. For example, you can convert a table to text, but it took me a while to figure out that there was a conversion *arrow* that looks similar to a \"back\" arrow (or *undo* arrow) that was actually the convert icon. I don't know if that example made sense, but the point is that you can do a lot with this if you're willing to figure it out.",
      "The interface is very janky and has numerous problems of which I cannot name from the top of my head right now. Despite this it \"gets the job done\" but despite this for simple editing such as moving images/shapes and paragraph spacing and intergers tend to be very janky. But I haven't had it for long but these are my first impressions on mobile.",
      "Not full-fledged like the Windows version, but good for the Android platform, well tailored to touch-screen interaction and a works well with mouse and keyboard on a tablet. You'll miss some features and sometimes find that annoying, but overall, it's probably the best word processing app you can get for your phone or tablet."

      "My experience with the app was really great until I went to update it. The app just completely stopped running for me. It would load a gray screen and then just send me back to the homepage. I tried re-installing the app, along with restarting my phone to see if that would help any. I really want to get back to learning songs from my phone, so can you please help? That would be great.",
      "Just use the website. The app blocks you from using features like transposing unless you pay money, which instead you could do for free on the website. An ad appears for every sheet you open, and usually unskippable. You want to try opening another window on your phone? Well now you're back at the home page of the app and have to find your sheet music again. Overral horrible. Don't recommend.",
      "The music I love, of all variety. The (actual correct) chords and so very much more. I've been using this app for years, however I more recently used the paid version. You have created the most outstanding app for music lovers and musicians alike. The paid version is way beyond excellent. Thanks. Jeffery T. Lowcountry S.C.",
      "So far so good. I will give this a try as I have been a lurker for the last 3 years and decided to subscribe. I will update after a few weeks under my belt. Update, after about a year, this app is great resource to any level musician. I do not have any issues with the app so far and is reliable. Definatly worth it!",
      "Where's the Transpose/Pitch option? It's also buggy as hell, if you switch to another instrument it jumps to a different part of the song and it often for no reason just stops and jumps to the opening screen and always when you press play it's a delay, if you turn on count in there's a delay between the count in and when it starts.. So why have a count in?"

      "Fantastic. Very easy to use. Easy to upload data. Gives hints of other possible family members with lots of information. You find lots of other people researching the same family line & you can even find living family, you never knew you had or maybe even lost touch with. Some of the photos that have been uploaded by other members can open up a whole new world of passed loved ones you never knew just come to life. More information of where your roots started can be an eye opener. Very enjoyable",
      "The best I've found so far, but it is a pale imitation of the web site. Cannot search UK only, which is more and more annoying the more I try to use the app. Even setting place to 'country only' still gives me mostly US results, when I absolutely know the person never set foot outside England. When you follow a hint, and save it, it only attaches to the person and perhaps spouse. A census does not add to other family members. You cannot download images like you can from the Web site.",
      "A great and convenience resource! I can load my information and have it at my fingertips when away from home. I get lots of follow-up information from others who have taken DNA tests and are linked to me. I've met many relatives previously unknown to me.",
      "Would rate zero stars. The DNA kits are are ripoff. You pay 70$for the kit, then what they don't tell you is to even view the results you have to pay the 25$ a MONTH membership fee. Then on top of that to even view part of your results you have to pay an extra 20$. So depending on whether you buy the kit on sale or not you are going to spend 100+ dollars per person . Would not recommend.",
      "Great app for family tree. Easy to use. I only use the free version. Hope it stays free. Only complain is the constant reminder for registration on the screen. It blocks the view 😪"

If I want the 'full experience', apparently, yes. I think $20 & $30 would be much more reasonable (annual price of course). What, is Dick's really hurtin' for money?",
      "My household has been using GameChanger for the better part of 8yrs. It's been a life saver for my wife and I, friends, and other family members when we couldn't be at the field watching our daughter play. I personally don't have any issues with GC, except one. The developers should add a start time button that logs the start time of games and a functioning clock that keeps up with the game time. If you have a kid playing baseball or softball you know how important this is.",
      "This is by far the most detailed way to Score Keep your games. It's a little bit tricky bc it literally does everything and has a selection for every scenario but if your very serious about tracking your team's games and stats I don't know of a better way to do it. Highly recommend to anyone serious about Scorekeeping.",
      "It kind of slow behind on play when it live. A I dont like it cause im under someone account however I subscribe to live, and if they are'nt around my live is dead. It won't work. Other than those two issue I like it. When you now able to be there, this is your eyes and ears.",
      "Pretty easy to use. Only wish the count would stay highlighted (brighter) on Android OS when entering balls and strikes. Hard to see in sunny condltions. Otherwise love the stats and newspaper-like article that generates after done scoring a game (with paid membership)."

I'm saying they want to scam you a crazy amount of money just to see what you will look like when you grow up.And their ads are worthless due to how bad it is.The game is trying to track down your location to rob your house which is what this app will leading to.So I would recommend not to download this application and play somethings else and wait until you grow up to see what you will look like.",
      "Seriously, $30 a month for a few photo features? No, I don't want to spend that every month to see what animal I resemble or what I might look like as I age. On top of that, 75% of the time it either says there's an error or it can't find the face that is very clearly there- facing forward, totally in the boundaries and clear as can be.",
      "Waste of time. All it does is asks u to subscribe and see the result but theres a way to see the result by watching an ad, did that and it only put blurs on our faces. Plus the baby prediction was so wrong. We already have a baby that look nothing like what they predicted. Also how did they get my bank info!?",
      "I couldn't find anywhere except in user reviews about having to pay for a fee and needing a \"free trial\" that actually states it'll charge close to 30 pounds per month. Maybe something to mention up front if you can't do a thing without giving up your credit card or bank details. Like I'd pay £341,88 for a year of seeing how I fake age and what animal I look like. If I'd be dumb enough to pay that? An ass.",
      "If only there were half ☆s...I watched the video of this app and thought \"Wow, this seems like the real deal, it actually shows how you age (& not in a fake or phony way!)\".. I was impressed. I thought it would be fun, so I started my 3 day trial ($30/mo after!); I tried the aging one, and it depicted me the same but with messed up eyes and some wrinkles (Snapchat does better!). All other options I tried were worthless, too. PLEASE dont waste ur $!!! WORST APP EVER!!!!! FALSE ADVERTISING!!!"

If you have the app opened in the background and send a response at a later time the app rejects it and hangs. You have to close the app, open it again, and send the message again. How is this app even allowed to ship without proper scaling built in? It looks like the team needs to focus on their spaghetti code clean up rather than new features for a while.",
      "It wasn't like the app I heard it was or imagined it to be! The reason I installed the app was just that other dating apps like tinder are overcrowded. I heard this app delivers quality matches but using it for past three days I won't agree with the statement. This app has very limited features to use for free and seeing the way the app operates in the area I am using it, won't make any difference to get the high pricy paid version. I hope it gets better with time but won't recommend downloading",
      "Probably the best design of any dating app I've tried. However, the developers botched the monetization so badly it ruins the experience. They also suggest users who haven't logged in in two weeks, which is far longer than other dating apps. Get ready to swipe on a whole lot of stale bagels that haven't actually opened this app in ages.",
      "Been having some issues with the app recently. Issues like matches through \"Suggestions\" or \"Discover\" are not appearing in the Chat tab. Support through the app is also weird and doesn't give much confidence as they have a \"attach image/screenshot\" which doesn't work. I found this out while trying to attach screenshots regarding the Matches not appearing in Chat issue. Please fix the App . Thanks! Update #1, 17Mar2020 : both support and customer experience have ignored me for 24hours or more."

      "When I downloaded I was turned off by the very large amount they charge ($59.99 for a year) you do get a free 3 day trial but if you don't remember to decide whether or not it benefits you or you like it then you just lost $59.99 for food and other bills~! On the plus side it is entertaining and I could see it be a great platform for musicians, dj and comedians! I would love to get to try the Dolphin Anymoji :-)",
      "So, I like the app, but i can't say i love it, when you get to do the face stuff, It has bad quality, so it is hard to make it look sad, so this app isn't bad, but i wish it had better quality, next, you can only use a few faces, and that is sad, you can't even play Jojo Siwa!😭😧😠 Stop making it to where you can use only 3 faces.",
      "I really like this app but, it is also laggy on my phone and I can barely see the settings, and when I stick my tongue out it doesn't, I am not trying to be mean but, can you fix that? Thank you! And I don't know if it is only laggy on my phone. Thank you!",
      "You can only do a free trial for three days!!😭 And then you have to pay $60 a year!😡😭 The bad thing is that I REALLY wanted this app, but nope! Way too much for an app... If the creators see this comment please make the app either cheaper, or ACTUALLY free..",
      "I love it, now I dont have to but an iPhone. Definitely not as great quality as an iphone. But I'm so impressed how this is the almost the same thing as iPhones. I love how you dont have to pay to use the thing, I like how theres free ones! Definitely considered for you guys to get this app awesome and I'm still amazed. ❤🥳"

Now they have my real number which they'll probably sell to scammers and telemarketers. Wish they would have disclose those details before making me give up my number. Not cool.",
      "All burner numbers I used to have worked for SMS and other verification services that allowed to stay anonymous for personal reasons be it safety or otherwise. Now not a single number can be used for the original intent, use, and functionality. Will be looking for a better service that allows for the full use of numbers as originally able to do. At the current usefulness of the app it's nothing more than an expensive quickly thrown out number that has zero usefulness unless you simply plan on ghosting people for dates or something else that's pretty lame.",

It works perfect to keep up with people that your required to speak to a person via court order, but do not need them getting your regular phone number. It is able to change, therefore allowing you to not have unwanted spam calls and prank calls very often!",

Cant get a hold of their support either. Use to be a 5 star app. Now just a theif. Update: was not resolved. Uninstalled.",

Update 3/22/20 would still love a archive feature on this app like you can with email or Google voice. Please please please add this feature."

      "Please help! No matter what I do the app continues to change my starting weight. So while I lost weight this week it shows that I gained weight. I am not on premium because I really just need a simple food tracking app as I'm doing alternate day fasting. It's just a little discouraging to have the app showing me I gained weight when I lost weight. I changed it twice before I started as it kept somehow going back to a different starting weight. 30 pounds less than I am!",
      "Easy, not crowded with ads, connects to Strava if you pay. It is only $40 a YEAR. I havent upgraded yet, but thinking I will. I like the barcode scan option. Havent used the food photo yet. Has all I need. No pestering coach, but it does send a notification like once a day if it has been a while since you recorded. I like a little reminder, but not one ever hour as some apps seem to do. So far, I like the app. Much better than the other free one I tried.",
      "Very good app. I feel it is worth the price for premium. Previously I was using MyFitnessPal until the bugs just became too much. The one area that needs improvement is search. While it works most of the time there are enough times searching doesn't happen when inputting info. Latest example: cauliflower pizza returned chips, cookie, mashed potatoes, amazing greens, etc...

There are many features which would take long to describe, and there's been the occasional crash of the app, which doesn't surprise me. But overall, Im very pleased with Lose It! I have tried to reach out to Lose It staff to ask questions not on the website. I'm a bit disappointed for no response. That said, Lose It! seems to be the best at what I need.",
      "This app used to be great, but not so much anymore. They've taken away standard features and only made them available in the premium upgrade. My Fitbit only syncs in premium now. I'm also really disappointed that you can no longer see all of your daily nutrition amounts, only fat, carbs and protein. You can no longer see sodium, sugars, fiber, etc. I've used this app for years, otherwise I'd look for another one."

      "My kids and I love geocaching but I'm getting really frustrated at this app. It wont show any geocaches since the last week. We were in the middle of the woods when all the geocaches disappear off the map. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I restarted my phone, I even logged into another phone. I still have no geocaches on my map. I have paid for a year subscriptions. I am highly disappointed. Can someone help? If not, can I have my money back?",
      "Never consistent ,offline mode is horrible, works when it wants to. GPS is always way off,when other gps apps have usuable accuracy at +-10ft ,the geocaching app is off by 30 ft or more. Why have an app that's supposed to find things be GPS, then you have to carry a second gps,or direct input the coordinates in another app on the same phone to find it. Every update now it seems to make the app worse.",
      "Nice little app for geocaching. One downside is that souvenirs are not displaying on it but they do appear on the desktop version. Seems it's a known bug with Android and logging out and back on didn't help - I lost the one souvenir that was displaying. Be good if that could be fixed. On Samsung S7 Android v8.0 with latest geocache update.",
      "I love geochaching but the app keeps ceasing over and over again! After closing the app I reopened it and it will not load anything, the map won't even move or let me zoom in! It completely ruined my geochaching adventures today and its frustrating beyond words!",
      "I love Geocaching! Gets me out in the woods and helps me find hidden gems at times. The only complaint is that sometimes the GPS sends me a ways away from where the cache really is... and has me looking way longer than needed."

      "This has been a decent application - not without some issues though. I love the fact you can have your passwords in folders and subfolders. This makes it easier to share it with my spouse and also allows us to store less frequently used or no longer used passwords in a subfolder. About two years ago there was an upgrade that messed up how the folders worked. They would come up differently on different platforms (such as phone vs computer) but it still worked fine. This got fixed. Then recently I somehow got signed up for file storage and breach watch options, neither of which we use. When I tried to renew, I could not get these off the renewal option. I contacted tech support and they fixed both issues quickly. I was then able to renew without these options. That was fantastic! To get to 5 stars, I'd expect no issues at all until after the next renewal - no problems with folders, and no problems with renewal at the same rate.",
      "This app requires you to pay $29.99/year simply in order to delete your files they let you create when you were using a so called \"free trial\" - I've used the app for 800+ days according to one I first created a file through the app, I've utilized the app consistently since then. Sounds pretty shady to me to hold on to my data and require money after allowing me to use it as a password locked notes folder basically. The app claims to help you more than it does I wouldn't recommend their service.",

      "I used to really like this app. Not that much since the latest update that messed up one of the features I enjoy the most : the Reading mode. It no longer operates properly. To my despair... Since my last review, absolutely nothing has been done to improve the Reading mode feature, which is really poor on my android smartphone compared to similar apps. Is there any way to improve the Reading mode feature?",
      "If digital documents are a part of your everyday, then you've heard of adobe. My line of work regularly involves sending and modifying PDF documents; Adobe Pro and DC are just outstanding as a 1 stop shop...add in adobe scan and its instant from my phone to desktop and ready for editing! Creating, editing, preparing, and even signing are all done from 1 convenient application!",
      "I've been using Adobe for years. But since it's last update, it will not open pdfs like it used to. Better yet, the app just won't open! Garbage update. In case you're wondering, I'm using a Galaxy S8+, yes, blah blah blah everything is updated. Just saying",
      "Auto-cloud forcing, Apple level frustrating! Stop forcing the F** cloud on us! It's not brilliant it should be an option! Files just cannot be saved locally apparently, only broadcast into the cloud. Re Reply: This is not just a reader, it's an editor & creator, these functions are cloud only. That is not optional. To say I don't have to use half the app is not optional. Allowing me to save privately to the device I'm using would be optional.",
      "Kinda blows my mind that you need to pay for a subscription just to change the color of your text from black to white. Maybe I just couldn't figure it out with the free version, but that should be a basic feature. Not paying $10 just to use the app once, maybe twice, to get a different text color. Unless someone can tell me how to do it in the free version, I give 1 star. Money grabbing scam from what I can see"

      "I love this app! I usually used to have many flyers or anything to create - sort of apps. But Canva provides multiple options to create such as templates, flyers, t-shirts, cards and many more options which are uncountable. Many other applications have these features but different options in different apps. But Canva provides multiple options in the same apps which is great! I have no complaints at all. Not even 1 drawback in this app. I highly recommend others to use this application.",
      "It is a nice app, a lot of artistic designs and templates. But, the app crashes frequently. I worked on a project and I made 9 slides, then I went out of the app (to download my own pictures), then back again but suddenly my latest 5 slides were missing. This app is nice and I love it, but this happens too much (it happened numerous times before). Please fix this problem.",
      "Do far so good. The one thing that's been bugging me that I haven't been able to figure out is; I'm not able to see certain colors when using the app on my Android phone. That's the reason for the 4 star rating. I'll change this rating as I'm able to figure out the solution to the problem. Thanks",
      "After the update I lost ALL of my works, at least I had saved some on my phone. I'm pretty disappointed at this and that is why I giving the low rating, since it isn't such a reliable app. Other than the \"reliable\" issue and some bugs that I encounter from time to time, the app is great for creating professional artworks.",
      "Canva is an amazing program and a fantastic tool, but DO NOT download this for Android. If you can, use your PC or buy an iPad, but for some reason the Android version of this app has almost no functionality, it will not maintain image formats between devices. Simple tools such as backgrounds and elements are simply nonexistent. I have never been so consistently frustrated by an app. These features clearly already exist. Edit: App is fully updated. Nothing helpful has been added."

      "Overall, this is the best activity tracker that I have seen, especially for cycling. The only downside is the occasional crash when recording via cellphone. The interface is clear and intuitive and the social aspects bring a community of interested and interesting people together around activities that we all enjoy. Now go out, and do something awesome.",
      "The app is great for the most part. There is still the occasional inconvenience whereby if I read the details of someone's workout then go back to viewing the workouts of the peeps I follow, the app will scroll to the most recent addition. So imagine having scrolled through 10-20 people, examined a workout then having to start again from the top. It's quite the pain.",
      "The Strava app offers good tracking of activity and a nice way to connect with community around your training. However as a nordic skier, I can track my individual skis, but that is all. Because nordic is not one of the three core sports (bike, run, swim), the platform does not include any of these activities in my profile. It also does not track totals or allow me to set goals because nordic is not a core sport. Unfortunate given the other functionality.",
      "Works pretty good. I enjoy a out of features, like automatically linking you with people you're running with. The GPS seems to work fine and there's a decent amount of analysis of you're into that. That said, there still seem to me a lot of bugs. When I you to share runs it'll often say I did but nothing will happen. Sometimes I'll upload a picture to a run and it won't be there, I'll do it again and then there's two. I'd still say it's one of the best running apps are there.",
      "Strava is a pretty good app though seems to have a few bugs at the moment. Worst of all though is the support, there just isn't any. I like using Strava to check my runs and would love to give five stars but the problems my wife and I are having with the app they're lucky to get two stars. This review has now gone to one star and I wouldn't give that to be honest. Downloaded an update and still the same problems. I'm not paying for the premium app if they can't get the basic app right"

      "this app is not user friendly. It timegates all female calls. American calls are audio only for 30 SECONDS inciting you to skip. if you're lucky to get one. the gender is not randomized, you practically only call men on free calls. and does not give you an option to select region. 70% of my calls lasted 1 second that were men from India. price is too steep to be considered efficient. Have to pay for literally everything. Just plain awful.",
      "I keep on receiving messages from users on the app, and the number of messages has reached 11 but I can only see 1 user and 1 message in the messages tab. The subscription is expensive. I went through many international matches which seemed to be only prerecorded for sometime and which then end up abruptly after the \"recorded\" video seems to end.",
      "I dont usually write reviews but was not happy. Most people are real but even though I paid the 1 month subscription, I still have to pay to call-back or answer calls and after a certain amount of messages are sent, they charge extra for those too! And if somebody messages you first, you cant reply unless your subscribed. This app should be more lenient and less of a money grab. Apart from that it was great. So they get 2 stars.",
      "I m happy using this app, but the premium membership is very expensive. Have to work out on it so it can be affordable. To send a msg to premium member is also expensive, at least give free access to reply for the message .",
      "It's pretty much disappointing app, as it says unlimited calls and all on premium membership however you still gotta spend coins for call which is completely opposite what they for providing premium membership plus if you write them they won't bother to get you back on the issue."

      "Very streamlined, a lot more detail than other brain training games. The games/challenges are brilliant,, it also tells you where you are most advanced. The only thing I would change is the yearly cost and make it monthly, I'm not currently working so can't afford the yearly cost in one go, so I have given the 7 day free trial a go, even in the further info about the app, it says that elevate offers a 14 day trial and I only wish that I could continue with it.",
      "So far so good, been playing for about a week. I'm enjoying the content, I like how its getting harder with improving scores and the graphics are really solid, it's a very attractive game and it appeals to my competitive spirit by mentioning how you scale with the community of players. It's a fun way to exercise brain muscles. I just purchased pro to help support the creators, and I honestly don't regret it .",
      "Excellent app, developers! My brain is getting better by the day. My language skills aren't bad, 'cause I train them for college all the time, but my math skills are really diamonds on the rough, so I'm polishing them most especially. Thank you for making this! I recommend it to anyone who needs to polish their cognitive skills. 👏👏👏",
      "great app. I would give it 5 star if there is a way to backup my progress. dont really understand the ranking system. my rankings in each game is much lower than my ranking in each skill (writing, speaking, reading and math). my skill rankings are too high and I suspect that could be because the app does not have enough users.",
      "I mostly like this app. Some of the sections are extremely frustrating because they just don't work correctly. Specifically, working with commas. The app doesn't recognize when or where you tap on your phone screen accurately. Since it works fine on other sections of the app, I feel sure it's the programming and not my phone."

      "Paid for an annual subscription which I loved until it stopped working. The app stopped working and unfortunately I've not had a response to the request for support that I made 4 days ago. Highly disappointing............Update. Unfortunately the email I've received 5 days after sending hadn't taken in to account the comments of my email and therefore made no difference to the issues I continue to have.",
      "Love this app! SWEAT tells you exactly what exercises to do at the gym, so all you have to do is rock up and follow the workout plan. There are different trainers to choose from, so you can pick a routine that suits your style of exercising (home/at the gym). Each week's exercises get a little harder so that you keep progressing and getting stronger. It also includes a meal plan (I don't follow it though so can't comment).",
      "Besides the price, which is different in Denmark (higher), this app needs to be re-design. First, it is not intuitive. There is a lot of text all over, pop up windows asking you multiple times do you really want to quit this and that, really, really.. Second, it is annoying that during the workout you can't go out of that window back to dashboard while the timer is on. Third, my progress photos in the app can't be seen unless I'm paying for that month.",
      "The PWR workouts are good (though I'm rather bored of mountain climbers and star jumps...) but the app is frustrating and not often intuitive. Most annoyingly, there is no way to track weights for different exercises to see if you are improving week-to-week. I'm not able to skip through sections easily (if, for example, a machine is in use at the gym). Can't return to a previous section of a workout once it's been completed or even view it to see what you've already done. Timer doesn't always work when screen is locked. Quitting a workout makes you jump through multiple hoops and give a reason (and my reason for quitting is usually not listed but there is no \"other\" option). Not able to quit the workout from the screens that appear between sections of the workout - instead have to start the next section, then pause, then hit quit, then several other buttons. A shortcut button to the home screen at the end of a workout would be great instead of having to tap through multiple times before being able to hit \"return to dashboard\". In addition to this, the meal plan is dangerously low in calories for someone of my build who is completing 4 workouts a week.",
      "It's just as good as I hoped! Really helped me building a fitness routine. I love it and use it every day! I inly had a few problems with the connection to Spotify to listen to my own music. Sometimes Spotify is jumpy, stops playing and when you fiddle with it when you are in the middle of a workout, the workout timer pauses. Other that that, it's perfect."

      "App lacks support. Covid-19 mean there is no content going to be released for months. No clue why I can't get any support help for a refund since there is no content at all being released. I just feel like I will get bounced back and forth between the devs and google until I give up and they take my money... money for absolutely nothing.",
      "Very basic app for what this service is and could be. Limited choices on how to watch on your phone holds this app back on it being as good as other live streaming apps, like Twitch (hint hint), Netflix etc. A pop-up window so you can watch while doing other stuff on your phone would be great and make this app/service way more useful. Also the choice to have it play audio only when you exit the app to do other stuff. The service is good, the app lacks usefulness and functionality.",
      "Great Champions League coverage, I follow it for the boxing which is amazing and offers than the US shows. The football coverage and NFL, NBA and lots of other sports really make this value for money. I would like to be able to set reminders for specific sports (darts,boxing etc.) and maybe incorporate the eurosport schedule into what you can set reminders for would also be a great addition and being able to select the language commentary as my German wouldnt be at a level to follow.",
      "Always crashes my phone. Must be an error coz I have to restart my phone completely as it becomes unresponsive but I cant power off. This has happened 4 or 5 times - pretty much the last couple times I used it. Great product but the app sucks. Guess I'll wait and watch it at home on my desktop.",
      "DAZN on my LG G6 is great. It actually works better and runs much smoother than when I watch on the PS4. The issues that plague the PS4 app(lag, constant buffering, cutting out and freezing) are virtually non-existent on the mobile app. Great job! Now please fix the bugs that plague the PS4 app, so I can also give that app 5 stars. Besides that, Thank you DAZN for great sports entertainment at an affordable price."

      "It's so many spam accounts on the app. I almost believe BLK is making up profiles to keep people subscribed. I have had the absolute weirdest interactions or none I would say. I've connected or matched with so many people, yet no communication or very odd communication, then the profile suddenly disappears. Very strange, will not re-subscribing after my subscription for this month expires.",
      "Worst account management ever! I got a new phone number and now can't get back in to my account. No options to retrieve or reset user's account login information. Extremely poor design. Use brain when designing apps. Password reset option are BASIC FEATURES on every app except this one.",
      "The app is cool but use a few tweaks. For one when looking through profiles that have liked you, I'm unable to see ALL pics from that profile. Just the main pic which sucks bc sometimes the main pic is a meme, blurry, or cuts off face. If I'm paying I should be able to see all pics on profile under that category not just the random profile swipe part. Also distance/location should be added and stick to age ranges I have chosen. I have 32-42 but get lots of 20 year olds.",
      "Good app for the most part, has potential. Could be much better if it had a distance filter. I made one match so far and 7 others like me, but like my match they are TOO far away. Also maybe a 1 week free trial could promote the quality of the memberships.",
      "I really like the concept of this app. I honestly think it should be more booming than Tinder. My only complaint is that theres no distance meter - its tragic when I find someone I think I can vibe with, come to find out they're 200 miles away. Add one of those in and it's 5 stars."

      "Paid for premium $2.99/mo. for a year. It never worked. I didn't get premium service. When I got a new phone, I tried to add it..ATT had a service contract with Lookout. Followed instructions on adding the phone... nope... But I did get billed another 29.99 for the yearly subscription. Cancelled it completely. And at earliest convenience, ATT allows the service to be removed. That will be getting done. If customer service isn't a priority, then neither is my money. Somebody else will take it.",
      "I used the free version of this app for a little while, and I'm not sure if it detects anything at all. So I feel the free version is not even worth using. Since you have to sign up for the premium version if you also want internet and Wi-Fi protection. Anyways overall it's a ok security and antivirus app, but I'd be more likely to start using this app again. If the free version also came with internet and Wi-Fi protection.",
      "Lookout is the only trusted app for mobile end point security. It is thorough and intelligent and is actively working all the time. We have tested it thoroughly and found it to be effective and well worth the small premium free per month. The world of security is changing as the threats are changing and Lookout manages those expectations well. This is a well trusted solution for our end clients.",
      "*Update* Worse than before, lookout responded to my review with deception. I have verified, and my observations are accurate. False advertising! 1)No free trial for premium. App def does demand for CC info and immediate payment if u try premium features. If you submit CC info u wil be charged! 2)There is no uninstall prevention and no device admin option from within the app settings as is declared in the gplay description and on the lookout site. 3)Locating device in real time DOES NOT WORK!"

      "This is BS!! DON'T BELIEVE the 1 week FREE TRIAL! It's a LIE! It'll ask for your CC for \"in case you don't cancel in time\" but when you do cancel in PLENTY of time it will tell you 'NO REFUNDS' that is FALSE ADVERTISING and just plain BS in my book!! I'm FURIOUS! I was raised to believe there's nothing worse than a thief and a liar and they are BOTH!",
      "Signed up for th 7 day free trial. Cancelled the same day (so as to not forget). Charged for a full year 7 days later. Not impressed af all that the 7 day trial with the option to cancel was not true. Feeling very misled by the app. ***I have responded to your email with the required information and still have yet to receive a refund***",
      "I didn't mean to subscribe to this app. I only wanted to try the 7 day free trial and it charged me for the year. I also went to add something to food log and everytime I scanned the barcode it couldn't find it. It also doesnt have normal stuff, for example lunchables or mountain dew. Crazy!!!!",
      "I wanted to do a trial week of this app. When I signed up it only gave me the option for a yearly subscription. So I thought well, it says there is a trial week I can cancel later right,.....wrong. The trial option only applies to the monthly subscription, which I didn't get the option to choose between yearly or monthly. So now I am stuck with an app for the next year that I may not even use. Be careful before you hit subscribe. Better Me did.make things right and I did get my refund.",
      "Do NOT get this app!!! I was thought there was going to be a 7 day trial but then it charged my card for the full year. I tried to cancel realizing that it was a horrible app, but I couldn't. I emailed them and got an automated reply and it said they would get back with me within 48 hours and they did not.. This app is very misleading. I got my refund from this app. I still would not get this app"

      "The amount of content is not enough for the price asked. I love the concept of this app but it falls short. First, cable providers should not be involved at all. We stream in order to get away from cable companies. Also, there are not enough novelas. I feel that this app would be great if the whole catalogue of novelas(especially classics) was available to stream. I was hoping to find an app that would let me binge on all the novelas possible.",
      "It was working fine then the last few weeks on Roku episodes started flickering in and out. I have also had the issue of watching NOVELA and they remove them and I'm halfway through. Do you guys not keep track on the audience? I pay for this and its frustrating that shows are removed. But older shows remain. **NOW on Roku it said if you had cable you need to download app. I don't have cable. I removed and then re-added channel and I'm locked out of shows on my list. ***Must fix!",
      "It was working fine. But when I stopped paying it for 2 days..it cancelled then I went to pay for it and now it won't let me watch my shows because it's says \"You have not payed\" but I have and I don't want them getting my money from my card if I won't be able to watch my shows.",
      "The app works as it's supposed to. My main issue is you pay for this service and still have to watch alot of ads.... you can't skip them... cannot fast forward or rewind without watching one or two... for $10 a month??",
      "It's very great I can watch my favorite novelas but it's not working for me it says Everytime I click it it says it's not disponible in my region idk what that means"

      "Barely usable. You have to pay for everything. LITERALLY EVERYTHING. Notifications pop up for people nearby and tells you to write to them. When you try however, it tells you cutely that you have to pay 200 credits in order to start a conversation. Ridiculous. What is also ridiculous that if you don't pay for premium, after 10 swipes(doesn't matter if left or right, tested it), it pops up one unskippable, unmutable video advertisement which can be any length from 5 to 15 sec. Frickin annoying. And when you manage to match, most people don't even write back. I swear, if you don't pay, your matches are not always notified about your messages. Never happened on Tinder which is a much more better alternative.",
      "Suddenly ads. Ads everywhere. Completetly ruins it all. Also most users are inactive. Constant nagging about paying. And (very) large amount of out of country persons... Yes. It is free to use. But three ads on the screen at the same time is kinda screwed up. Usability and experience went down the drain compared to the competitors. Solved it by deleting my account and uninstalling 😎",
      "This app is pointless. I swiped right almost everyone and I couldn't find a girl who would write back or even just read my messages. The ads are irritating. The cards sometimes run out, even if you put the distance to maximum which is stupid. After a while you will match up with the same people over and over again. And sometimes people get deleted for no reason. I finally had enough after I gave it another chance.",
      "This was an ok app at first and so I decided to check out the premium feature just to see what it's about. You pay around $8 dollars a week to have premium. What does premium get you? Almost nothing! With premium you get to see who added you as a favorite, see who liked you, get priority message, chat with new profiles, undo no votes, and go incognito mode. That's all you get for $7 a week and that's $28 a month. Even with premium, you still have to use credits and credits do not come with premium. I was thinking for $7/week, you should get a lot more or even credit every time you renew but nope. Do not get premium because it's not work the cost.",
      "This is a great app, i love meeting new people from all over.. I think i had this app installed awhile back but wasnt interested in it. But now as i try it again it really is a great app.. I plan on doing the lifetime membership because it does seem worth it in the longrun with all the future friends you can meet on here.. Its not just dating app, it is a way to make friends from all over the world just like having a penpal. Worth 10 stars"

You can't do a damn thing until you sign up for one free week and $7.99 a month after that which to be honest I wouldn't mind, IF I COULD CAST TO MY TV! BUT YOU CAN'T!!!! If I could cast, I'd get the subscription. Until then this app gets 0 stars from me. Complete waste",
      "What a scam. Payment method expired so after a couple months decided to cancel the subscription. Cancelled they a few days later updated payment methods for other apps. They then decided to reinstate my subscription for Noggin without permission. I'll never use this again.",
      "Nothing works. Every time I try to verify my email address be it on my phone, tablet or computer, I get an error. Not to mention many of the games won't launch. I'm sure if things were to work properly it could be a good service. Uninstalled",
      "The recent update has changed the entire layout. Its much more confusing now with games mixed in with the episodes. The names of episodes no longer show either. When you're done watching/playing be sure to close out of the app completely or the show moght start up/continue on its own several minutes later. This is especially creepy in the evening. I'm hoping for an update/fix soon otherwise we'll be cancelling our subscription.",
      "I have this for my four year old. he played the games and watches shows. we have it on a tablet and two TVs. never a problem. $8 a month is cheaper than cable."

      "Between the profile attributes, the 20 questions, and the group interests, it has the potential to be a good Tinder alternative. HOWEVER it is foremost way too expensive. $15 a week, $4.60/wk for 3 months ($50), or $2.30/wk for a year ($105). $15 a month? Eh, maybe but not worth it. $15 a week? Not a chance. Like Tinder (and others) the majority of your matches even if you are attractive will be scams. If you are not (like me) it will be all scams. Easy to spot, but annoying and demoralizing.",
      "Better than tinder assuming you are not willing to pay 33 something dollars for tinder premium or whatever it is. This is great if you don't want to spend money. Like why make money off people looking for a relationship, its cruel, but this app isn't super restricting. You're able to talk to people who like you(that's important for me), you can filter your preferences, you can see who swiped right or is interested in you, etc. If you pay for clover premium it's half the price of premium tinder.",
      "The app is a nice change from Tinder and Bumble, but I went for the free premium trial and was mortified to discover the app sending tons of messages on my behalf to people I am absolutely not interested in. There is no way to turn this feature off that I can find. This is embarrassing to say the least, and problematic at worst. I work at a college and could face repercussions if I'm seen to be making a pass at a student. Please do better.",
      "So far, I have found Clover to be a very good App for putting people in touch with each other who may never have had the chance or known the other existed, bc its based on what 2 people nearby each other at the same time may find out when they decide to get together and meet. I just started so we shall see!",
      "Only got this app because literally every add says FREE and it is not free. You can not market something as free and force someone to give you an account with money on it for the services that were previously advertised as free. I want to explicitly say this would have been a 5 star app if I could even start a conversation without giving my card information."

      "Terrible. You open the app and doesn't let you play. It immediately wants you to buy the pro option. You can't play unless you buy it. This makes me think that there probably isn't just a free play option. Edit: found out that this company stole parts of a vidio on YouTube for their ads. The uploader did not give permission, and it's not even the same game. This is a terrible product, and the developers should be ashamed.",
      "Stupid touch app, lets you drag slime over the screen and charges 81$ for access to more slime. My 4 yr old has bought VIP, currently trying to gain a refund. I understand my child should have been watched a little closer, but even that aside, if I had bought this app for that much, it would still prompt a refund since the cost simply is not justified by the product. Will hopefully be able to repost a nice story soon.",
      "I mean I with alot of people on 1 star reviews! This app is horrible you can't play it because you get bored waiting for the X so then you can get of this add wanting you to buy products!Its getting annoying coming on a app that used to be great no adds or anything but now its just ruined! I hope nobody bought that add because its a waste! Whoever made this should be ashamed!",
      "Never got around to playing as the fact it's subscription-based put me off. Three days of free trial followed no free option but an immediate £49.49, whatever it was, is ridiculous considering the potential nothingness of this game. *edit - apparently there IS a free option, however the developers have designed this (very sneakily) so that it takes a long time for the X to close down the subscribe option (according to some reviews at least).",
      "lmao its funny how you dont even get do try it. it doesnt even deserve a 1 star, there should be none. its really funny tbh. if it were to have like, 5 options, then it would have been way better, but unfortunately, there is nothing. i expected less anyways. it looked, like not sketchy but kinda. disappointed, but defs not surprised."

      "Please don't use this app. A lot of people use it, but the app itself is terrible. If you select 5 mile radius, it will still show you things 100miles away. It never saves your default search settings, nor does it save your location unless you always keep location on. Other apps don't do that. It is a terrible app that they refuse to update. The only positive is that is a lot of people use it for some reason. Please start selling your stuff on other apps that actually care about the users.",
      "Great app. The distance setting in the search filter was a little off. Like I tried putting in items up to 30 miles away but it had some stuff in there that was to me like 40-50 miles away. It seemed better when I narrowed it closer to my location though. That's the only issue I've experienced with it. The process to post what you want to sell is NOT overly complicated, it's simple to use, but it's kind odd looking for me though. But that's just my opinion there, everything else seems great.",
      "I've had great success with this app, my only complaint is regarding the ads. I do understand to keep this app 100% you need to show ads but I find them to be repetative, rather intrusive and very large. If you don't know to keep scrolling once you see a large ad then you will miss out on a lot things for sale.",
      "It's a great way to make extra money. It's fun to meet with all the interesting people however there are a few flaws to the game. For instance, it is a turn off when a person promises to purchase and they give a date and time then they never show up! Its It's frustrating, and a waste of time I wish that LETGO could implement some kind of consequence for the people that stand people doing things",
      "This is a platform that works and is built well. However the app still has many bugs. They're mostly annoying, some are a little inconvenient. None of them inhibit use of the platform though. They've got a ways to go, and are founded on solid ground. Personalized recommended searches must be based on nothing, because I get recommendations for electronics but all I search for a bit are clothes. Notifications to my phone duplicate themselves, lag, and are sometimes broken."

      "always works (for decades)... closes apps in the background that aren't being used, gets rid of junk files, it protects my phone and my laptop... for free 😁!!! for what I need the computer for and for what files I have, they're always protected and cleaned out. Under options or settings, I think in the privacy policy, you can set the options so they do not share any of your information with their sponsors. Always great, safe, functional, and free!!! AVG ROCKS!!!",
      "I like this app, it doesn't slow my phone down to a crawl, and for a very reasonable fee I upgraded to get the use of VPN, there's just too many wireless connections out there with NO security at all. The boost and cleanup features are quick. With this AV, and the VPN, along with some carefullness on the users part, (don't click on everything u see), it's a great layer of security.",
      "Keeps my phone running smooth, virus free. Cleans out the junk and duplicate files that slows down my phone. There are a lot of ad but they don't interfer with the apps performance. The saying, \"You get what you pay for\" while true, can't be used against AVG AntiVirus Free & Mobile Security App in anyway. The app is free and it does a great job keeping my phone secure. If a few ad's bother banyone than you have the option to pay for ad free service. Thank You AVG for great service & security.",
      "Update: Gave it a 5 star. The pop up was finally removed on a daily scheduled scan. Thank you. That was an annoying popup that occured every minute. *************** First review:I am only giving it 4 stars. I like being protected. I upgraded to wipe out a pop up that won't stop popping up, but it still pops up. I tried to post a pic of the ad from Tapjoy but am unable to do so.",
      "I have no issues with malware detection. Either I am doing a good job of avoiding malware and/or AVG is doing its' job. While the Free version is good, with having a mobile device, it's worth it to have the Pro version. I also use AVG with my laptop and PCs with no problems and with great protection."

      "Great. But, I'm new to evernote. But, addicted now 😍 Very excited having it. But, it need some updates. It's better to show following them on the task bar: Font color, change page color, font size, font style, comment option, insert table & etc. I love it soo much. But, expecting this like google docs",
      "Edit: seems to be fixed right now, except the formatting is still wrong. Lots of problems trying to sync when using it across different devices. I use the app on my phone and sometimes I'll try to log in on the website on my computer at work where I don't want to download the app. Whenever that happens all the formatting gets screwed up and it's so frustrating that I'm beginning to find it not worth using. There's better ways to store my information.",
      "As of today, a few seconds after I opened the app it takes me to an upgrade screen and says I have to purchase premium. I have to work from home because of covid-19 and need my notes, and now Evernote is making me spend money? Great timing.",
      "2020-03-15 v8.13 - insert line bug is fixed!!! Note Upload bug still there. OLD -Ver 8.12.1 installed today. Still the issue with the horizontal line inserting at the END of the note, not at the cursor position. This has been an issue since the update in June 2019. The earlier bugs with notes taking a minute to load has been fixed but some notes with graphics are still slow but more like 5-10 seconds slow. Premium user since 2013. Currently Android 7.1.1. 2020-01-17 new update; insert line bug still not fixed; also dealing with a \"Note Upload\" bug for several months. The app does a great job for me but these bugs are adding editing time to my day."

      "I was extremely excited to download this app after I read all the reviews. I got to the payment stage and it said it costs xx dollars per month. At the end it charged me for a full year. It says you can cancel subscription any time but what for when I have an year of payment. Also I needed to pay to actually see what they can offer. Again, cancelling my subscription will not change anything even if I don't like what they have to offer once I start using it. I'm repulsed to use it now",
      "Update: I had to reset my password in order for the app to work. I'm facing a problem. I paid for 3months of Asana Rebel today and I'm stuck in the log in page, repeating date of birth, height, weight many times to reach to the log in page and nothing! Please advise or a refund would be great. Hope to hear soon from you",
      "I get targeted by their ads all the time. Eventually, I did download the app. The free workouts are 4 minutes short and really boring. I'm not sure what the full workouts are like - if it's like the ad or not. There are so many great free workouts on YouTube or alomoves that you can do for free for a month.",
      "I love this app. Not only does it have guided workouts, it also has great guides for sleeping better, getting your nutrition, mediation, and improving your focus. My only complaint is that sometimes the guided workouts will freeze. I either have to wait for the video to come back or restart the guided workout video and find where I left off.",
      "Love the app ! Been using it daily for the last couple years and I am fully satisfied with it ! Just one point though, it doesn't seem possible to erase the data you've entered in your weight graph, and since I made a mistake a while back when entering the data, my graph is completely useless.. Asana dev, maybe the possibility to erase/rectify the data entered could be implemented ? :)"
