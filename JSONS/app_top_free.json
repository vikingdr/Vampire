      "Excellent overall. Two comments for improvement. 1. In areas of intermittent poor reception, zoom has trouble reconnecting, and under such circumstances it should prioritise sound, at low bit rate, and increase quality as signal improves and then add video. 2. When connecting via Bluetooth in my car, the sound seems to get channeled via the \"telephone\" function of the car radio, and not the Bluetooth audio. This is a poorer quality sound output.",
      "I've used Zoom for a business network group spread across the US & Canada and it has allowed us to meet and discuss issues weekly. ... Almost like having a face to face. Being able to share screens and computer program info was especially helpful. I've also used it for personal conversations with friends and family. Rather fun to introduce them to this technology. Simple and intuitive to use.",
      "Most reliable and complete conference call app. Been using this for years and it never fails me. Battery & data consumption is quite high",
      "You could use a better UI on PC, especially on Mac/Linux. Other than that, probably the most enjoyable video conference tool Ive I've ever used.",
      "I currently have a facebook group and I thought this application would make things easier for us to put on group meetings and have discussions. I find it difficult to add people to meetings and get things organized the way it would work for us. I think maybe I don't know all the ins and outs of it yet but it seems like it's a pretty good app. I don't know..."

      "Your app is not user - friendly. Thank goodness, it does have night mode, but most of your news pages go back to lite mode. There is no choice of landscape or portrait mode. Even on large font, it still is not that large. Not near enough bold print. No expandable windows. With just a few changes, this app could be very user - friendly and a very nice app. Please consider making some changes. All apps need to be user - friendly.",
      "I'm a busy person and I don't usually have time to rate these apps, but I have to say, News Break is amazing. I can get the info I need with one app and it keeps me up to date. I usually turn off notifications on all my apps, but I've kept notifications one with News Break, because they keep it accurate and up to date and I don't get repeated updates for the same thing over and over again, like some other news apps. Definitely keeping this app. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",
      "Bring your own bias filter. No news will be unbiased, this source is defiantly left leaning. It also seems to favor ABC, NBC, CBS, and major newspapers over internet based news sources. This is not a criticism, just an observation. That said, the coverage does seem to be relatively complete, on a macro level. Locally is hard to tell, I live in a pretty rural area, so it would be nice for the \"local\" reach to be larger. Also, the ads, while not intrusive, cause EVERYTHING to load slow.",
      "The articles are up to date and I would really like to be able to read them. The only problem is that if you hold your finger on the screen, the whole page flies to the bottom of the page. This is very annoying to constantly have to find the place you were reading at. For this reason I am giving 3 stars. Otherwise, I would rate it with 5 stars.",
      "So I downloaded this just to give out a warning about it. I saw an ad for this app on a YouTube video. It was implying that what was on was breaking news. The downside of that was it was fake. Why do I know this? Because I watched that video at least a year or two ago. And by the way, it is actually just a show, not the actual news!! In all, I don't know how the app is (look at other people for that), but just make sure your news digest is real."

It's an app I would definitely recommend if you love cosplaying or just making videos to make others happy. But their are flaws like your videos get taken down for no reason or because people just dont like your content.",
      "I have had TikTok prior and used it with no issues. However now, upon redownload, it won't allow me to post my videos. I can take and edit them but the \"post\" button is not there!! The videos are saving to my draft instead. I've even deleted and reinstalled the app. Please help."

      "This app came with my new LG, and at 1st didn't know what to make of it (as per getting used to any new ph 🤣). Still, I now have all breaking news (at the moment), and other news coming to me at specific times (changeable), so is what I now rely on as my only source for news. It is geo-programmed for local news, as that's what I'm receiving. As well as world news, and sports. All conveniently tagged at the top of the page, and coming as SMS messages 😉 I LOVE IT !! 💯☝",
      "This app is very useful for news from all sides and has a very organized layout. There is even an option to read a more HTML version of stories if you have slow internet, or you can read them straight from the web. One thing, however, and something that cant really be changed, is that it's the source of my anxiety regarding coronavirus.",
      "Could be a cool way to get news. But most the bloggers here always repeat what they stated several times to make it seem longer and wastes more time than need be. Bloggers constantly use slang, misspelled word, and some articles seem to be made up bull with a caption and picture (that dont even match half the time) that are just to lure in more clicks. Some news is ok maybe even most but sll tge other things make it very hard to follow along and want to keep reading, like didn't finish eng1!",
      "I really like smart news with one exception: news items are let on the site too long. I can see native 2 days running however when I see articles beyond that I can't get but wonder if they're being used as filler material? Just wondering. I can even handle the repetitive ads as they're easy to skip. All in all I like how you provide the news. I read every day. Thank you very much.",
      "Great updated news in a person's area or whereever they choose for their location is to get their news from.Luv thee app. It's very easy to use. Luv the great info. that it give's me everyday.Thanks to all who helped in creating this great app. I really love getting daily updaate's on what's going on in thee area that's surrounding me and where I live,too.Thank's for thee great info. and everything else that I get with it,too.It helps me to be safe!✋😀🌈🌈"

      "After the latest update, pressing on a classroom causes an error 'something went wrong, try again later' then I'm automatically unrolled from my class! I'm furious about this issue and it seems that many other people are getting it. It needs attention. Other than that, before the update Google classroom is great and I used it all the time to recieve assignments and post asignments",
      "Hey err... When I try log into my school account, it says \"We are sorry, but you do not have access to Classroom\" and \"Please contact your domain administrator for access\" and then it kicks me out of my school account! Weirdly though, it works through my Gmail account... I don't understand why it's saying that so please fix it! I need to work on things for school! 😭 (P. S: I'm using an Android phone)",
      "I use this app as a student. IMHO, complexity of the app is low - the task for junior developer. But even here some things aren't good. At first, menu item \"calendar\" just opens system default calendar. Silly. Secondly, there is no possibility to configure notifications. Earlier push notifications appeared the day before due date, but last week they started to show at midnight of the due date and woke me up. Big Brother decided this is convenient for all. Keep up good work. One star so far.",
      "As some people have pointed out, with one of the latest updates I can no longer access any classes or log in. The app seems to be in a Beta update... I never signed up for it... Google also hasn't fixed it yet which makes me think it isn't a serious issue for Google. Just revert the update, please!",
      "Before the February 20 2020 update it was working just fine but after installing the lastest update, it keeps removing me from my classes. I think this is an app problem because on the website version of google classroom my classes are still there. I uninstalled the app and downloaded it but now it is saying that my gmail doesn't work. I just to let you guys know that can you please update the bug, thanks."

It the application was opened, it basically takes you too it, but if not, absolutely nothing happens. Direct share works with other apps, though!",

And my chat list isn't loading. It happens to me every day and resetting end reinstalling isn't working. Fix this Facebook. It's annoying. 🙄 It started 3-4 weeks ago.",
      "Text works great. But when I call people it seems like the voice and video calls don't always work here in Cleburne TX. When I call people on the other side of the world it works fine but here in my town the calls don't always go through or get dropped or bad quality. Maybe the internet availability needs improvement in my town.",
      "Messenger recent update is bugged and I have tested it already on all 3 devices of mine, both android and iOS. Whenever I am trying to share something through messenger (be it a YouTube video, a photo, or an audio clip I have recorded in my phone's internal app), it will only pull up the Messenger app as if I am not sharing anything!!",
      "messenger sucks anymore.....have not been able to share and send articles to my friends as I did before, by clicking on share, then messenger and then name used to come up and I would click send next to their name, but will not and has not done for three going on four days today and do not know why! Is there something wrong with messenger? Can you please fix this problem and asap, thanks!"

      "Very useful app. But still there is a security issue. Because, anyone who is an admin of any group, can add any number without their permission. Instead I have a suggestion that, if a group admin needs to add a number to that group, then the owner of that number should receive a message to opt \"YES I am interested to join\" or \" NO I am not interested to join\". This will ensure more individual security. Hope you will update the changes. Thank you.",
      "Not the best instant messaging app but the most popular, which pretty much forces one to use it, and it's decent, especially now that it has a dark mode, save for the fact that we still can't edit messages to fix mistakes, or that we can't select messages and press the text bar to quote them like before, not even as an option. Two things to be added that'd greatly improve the app.",
      "Since the 20/03/2020 update I can no longer open whatsapp. It crashes every time. I can only access it if someone sends me a message and I click on the notification. I have been using this app for years and this is the first major problem I have encountered. I have cleared cache and even reinstalled a number of times without any success. I'm using a huawei P30. Please fix this issue/bug, i use this app every day to keep in contact with friends and family. I have notified support but no help",
      "Before the start of 2020 WhatsApp was the best social App ever created. However, since the start of the year, I'm not sure what changed but it went from a 10 star to a 1 star. Video calls are poor and voice calls are worse. You talk for a few minutes then the person on the other cannot hear you. At 1st I thought it was temporary but this has being going on steady for months.",
      "This app is very useful for me. It keeps my work sorted and I can also stay connected with my loved ones easily. It also helps in my business. A lots of pictures I can share with my clients easily. Easy conversation. Calls quality is good Video call feature is also nice. Overall this is very useful application for anyone and easy to use...."

    "comments":[
      "Streaming to tv has improved a lot, but you still cannot decide what level of HD you want to stream based on the bandwidth you have. You can do it for downloads, sort of (low/med/high), but this doesn't really tell you anything except for how many hours you can store. This is useless for phone users who may want to tailor the quality to their phone's resolution. Also, I think the older Simpsons episodes are still oddly cropped to fit 16:9, which cuts off some of the image.",
      "Lots of content, but the app is trash. The app is not at all feature-rich, and it is often glitchy. Most shows are 2min long, and it stops playback after every show. This drives my kids nuts, which in turn drives me nuts. I dont want to have to find and play a new episode every 2 min or less. Netflix has set the bar on what to expect from a streaming app, and disney cannot compete. Casting to another device, is never a smooth experience.",
      "Update March 22: after downloading an update for the app, now I can't watch anything. The audio come through but the screen just stay black. For all the shows and movies. Please fix. If you haven't update, don't do it!! __________________ Does not work in note 10 I have a note 10 plus and I get the error 83. Still waiting for the fix. Thanks.",
      "App almost always has issues loading, they don't have all the promised content and the downloads keep stalling. Update: Canceled subscription due to issues, but reactivated to give it another shot. Same issues, and now it will also not download content. Anything I want to load just sits in the queue waiting, verified settings and internet connection. Some new content has been added, but there is still quite a few gaps. They also seriously need to fix the formatting on the Simpsons episodes.",
      "Got the app when it originally came out a few months back to watch the mandalorian... But the moment the season stopped I tapped out because the app does not work. It freezes. Audio de-syncs. Not worth the money when other streaming services can provide subtitles, and fluid streaming. And if you look up the problem it just falls back onto your internet speeds... which I do not have a problem with. I regularly sit at 24mbps. Disappointed and will be uninstalling again."

      "I cannot add photos directly to my story because the app demands access to the microphone and location. I've turned on storage and the camera, but I still can't use it. Likewise, there's no global volume mute for the app. I don't like when audio starts randomly playing (and it's often too loud). The only recourse is to turn the volume off on my phone, which is undesirable.",
      "Account just got blocked even though I only followed a few accounts and liked some posts. Pop up keeps spamming saying my actions get blocked. Screen freezes and I have to exit the app because of this. Today it showed an action blocked popup then directed me to enter my saved mobile number. It said it would send a code via SMS to confirm that it's my number. The SMS was never sent and it's been like this for a couple of hours. Instagram please fix this. It has happened more than once",
      "Instagram has improved substantially even since I started using it two years back. The ability to save posts for later viewing & the interactive nature of the GUI makes for a very effective platform. My only criticism would be that I often struggle to link IG posts to my Facebook artist page. Other than that, I'm pretty into the whole thing.",
      "This app is very useful But I am facing some issue with my account. I am not able to hide stories from people. After selecting the people, there should be a check sign on the top right corner which is missing. That is why I am not getting how to hide stories. Also when anyone follows me, i see two accounts of the same name. And also when I upload any video with any audio which is restricted, I don not see Appeal option to continue the post. Due to this I am not able to post anything with audio.",
      "I love this but just I have one problem... It keeps taking down my profile picture, it was Melanie Martinez and the background of a pansexual flag. There was nothing wrong or innapropriate with it. I tried to upload it again and it took it down. I did this 5 more times and they kept taking it down. This leads me to belive that they took it down because of the pansexual flag. (Although there is nothing wrong with it)"

      "The app is alright. When the presenter's connection is terrible we are never able to see the screen and such. However, if their connection is good, then the quality is actually not bad. Although, I would like the creators to add a “(s/b) is typing...” bubble when someone is typing. This will prevent any unnecessary anger grunts from our teachers when the class is not answering their questions, even when someone is typing as fast as possible.",
      "Has worked flawlessly for me for quite a while. Lately, sound quality is even decent on low bandwidth connections. Audio can be difficult to understand if presenters use cheap phone microphones and stand far away, but you can't blame the service for that.",
      "App is great, but the output volume is too loud on earphones even when my phone volume is set to it's minimum. I have to take my earphones out and set them near my ear to have the app not screech into my eardrums. An option to adjust output volume in-app would be really useful.",
      "Chaotic, laggy, plain unorganized. Do not get this. I was excited the first time I saw this app, now I know I'm being led to dread whenever I see it. Its just crazy to the limits. That morning I had art class, I couldn't hear anything and even when I could it was bad quality. I had to sit there for about four hours listening to the disturbing sounds of people shouting and voices lagging. If you ask me, that was a one star experience.If you think this app is good by the outside think again.",

Not even my downloaded content. Also my bill is recurring so I hope it gets fixed right away. When I select a show that I want to watch is says \"The title is not available to watch instantly\", then on the downloaded content \"there is a problem. please try again later.\" Idk if it's just me? anyone also experiencing this?",
      "Good app for new shows and movies, I will be keeping it. If you are looking for older tv shows Hulu is the way to go. With both I feel like I have plenty of options. I have not tried amazon prime so cannot comment on that. No matter what you get there will always be that one show that you will have to sign up for Starz, HBO, Showtime, etc in order to watch but overall with netflix and hulu along with a 3 hour window a day to watch tv I feel like there is plenty to keep me busy.",
      "My first day and I've already had show's stopped till I picked the tablet up and assured Netflix I was still watching... about a dozen times. If you plan to grab something from the fridge or go to the bathroom, etc. expect your show to be stopped...and if really slow the app to lose your place. Haven't decided if this will be worth it or not. I will update in a few days if this is an everyday acurance when streaming. The content is good. Just not user friendly/convenient.",
      "I just changed my device three days ago and I re-downloaded the Netflix app. Since then Netflix has been saying \"can't reach the Netflix service\"! This is beyond infuriating as my subscription is wasting and I can't even use the money I have paid for. I need this fixed as soon as possible. I can't even log in via browser. I can't even reach your customer care either because they are not allowing me to call. Fix this!!! I am using a Tecno Spark 4 Air.",
      "I love the series the good place but i found out that theres a fourth season. Netflix doesnt have it along with many other shows i watched Netflix makes you wait a year until you can watch the next season. Other than that there arnt any adds or any other reason not to like it. But when you go to update it, Netflix doesn't tell you what its updating."

      "I never tried the phone app, because after I tried the free PC app, it was non-intuitive, buggy, & all-around AWFUL. After once getting it to work w/ a video conference, I deleted a user & then tried to add him back but couldn't; the user activation emails did not work. I'm willing to try again in the future, once they get the problems worked out. Oh, & it should install once for ALL users on a PC. I've recommended to the county emergency mgmt team I work with, to use Zoom for the time being.",
      "I love being able to be connected to work for emergencies. I can set my status and it syncs up to my calendar no problem. My company uses multiple platforms for communication. But I do think switching everyone to Microsoft teams would be very beneficial. I have not tested much of the group video conferencing. One feature that I do really like is that you can give someone access to your computer through teams to fix quick problems or collaborate.",
      "With the COVID-19 outbreak, my office had to scramble to figure out how to work from home. Our IT Manager kept saying we we underutilizing this program and he was right! You can use it on multiple platforms - computer, tablet, phone. Awesome chat feature - so it streamlines conversations, use instead of text or email. Share and edit files with your partners, you can edit the same document together. Use Planner to assign tasks. Link a notebook people can share their research, project ideas.",
      "I love Teams in theory. It's way easier than other systems to pull your documentation, meetings and general team collaboration together. However, the biggest issue is not being able to have multiple windows or tabs which means you lose all context if you need to quickly shift from a chat to a doc or have both open at the same time. Also, the complete lack of integration with Adobe around pdf documents means you need to download pdf docs every time as opposed to opening them natively.",
      "I love Teams. I haven't mastered it yet, and I know there is so much more that can make me more productive at work, but it's easy to use, and making the transition from IBM Sometime and Lotus Notes to Teams has been an easy process. I really like how quickly it synced up with my Office 365 account on my work computer, laptop, and my phone. It keeps me in the knownwith my staff and my colleagues, and allows me to share progress on various projects quickly and easily."

      "Great idea needs work. While in the app it lists some of my kids contacts but not all of them. It also does not open chat heads or give any kind of notification when someone sends a message while you aren't on you don't know I have multiple kids so as a parent it's frustrating trying to manage their accounts. If I manage one it signs me into theirs as them and then won't let me sign out to check on another ones account. I had to uninstall and reinstall. It has lots of potential but needs work.",
      "I love how this app is helping my kids stay connected with their friends during the shelter in place. I don't like that the tablet constantly rings when my young son is trying to take a turn playing on the tablet & there is no way to turn it off temporarily or put it on silent. When it has been ringing & you open the tablet the app automatically opens, I don't like that. You can set a sleep mode but \"weekends\" are Friday and Saturday & \"weekdays\" are Sun-Thurs, I need M-F after school hrs.",
      "I like the app and all, but I wish video chat was full screen like regular video chats are. Also, instead of you having to take a picture as your profile, I wish you could just like put any photo in your gallery instead of having to take a picture of yourself or something. If you guys just edit these things, it would probably be the best messaging app for kids, and for me.",
      "SO AMAZING! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHAT WITH PEOPLE JUST BY ENTERING A CODE! Just enter a code and boom! You can now chat with another person! It's that easy! There is some ads but they never occur when you are chatting or typing! You can even see when someone sent a message just by CLICKING THE MESSAGE!!!!I rated this five stars for a reason! DOWNLOAD NOW!!!",
      "Ehhh. It's not horrible and all but the thing that aggravates me is that you can't name people different names. Example: I want to name my friend '' bff '' but it won't let me only unless we're in a group with a bunch of people I'd really appreciate it if you fix that. Also, I'd like them to make it look more like fb messenger when you get on the main menu it just looks weird... and when you video chat people I wish you could see them with a full screen otherwise 5 star rating."

      "I'll state my couple of drawbacks first to get those out of the way. Not all movies have captions, so options for the hard of hearing community are more limited. Lots of amateur movies, or flat out corny, particularly among sci fi, so if you don't like that there's that. That being said, many great movies are on here. It's accessible via computer or phone, super easy to navigate. Suggested options aren't repetitive. Ads are short, and allow for the best part. It's free",
      "Loving it so far! I've always been aware of Tubi tv, but only recently have I stuck around and found plenty of movies and series to enjoy. Sure, there are ads here and there, but that's how these apps stay in business. Plus, it's Tubi TV, so think of them as your average commercials on regular television. So yeah, I'm loving this app, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good movies and tv app.",
      "I've just installed this and am about to watch my first movie on it. 5 stars for being free and transparent about how this app works...ie...ads. Given the current state of things with COVID-19 it's great to have this app to pass the time. I've only briefly glanced at the movie selection, but I'd like to see more current titles in the future. Lots appear to be old movies and/or ones I've never heard of. Hopefully I can leave my review at 5 stars after I've had more time to utilize it.",
      "Little specific complaints, but here's a few. Unique movies, nothing wrong with this just aren't my jam. I wanted to watch the film Rango, as shown in 2 of the images of the app, and it didn't have it, tad annoyed. Good interface Few ads Its free! I mean theres a chance I won't keep this forever but this is worth it as you lose nothing. Would recommend, 8/10",
      "Only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because you can't find \"common\" shows. Alot of \"knock-offs\". But it's free so can't complain too much. There's ads as if you're watching TV, but the app has to get paid somehow right? So long as we don't find out later that they steal or sell info, I don't have much to complain about. Will continue to use it till they run out of shows!"

      "I've noticed that on my account, the latest update made some visual changes, but for the most part, it looked like the visual layout of the one before it. I logged into a 2nd account and it was different. Map, chats, camera, discover, and the last one (I can't remember) was in a black bar at the bottom of the screen. After uninstalling, restarting my phone (not a factory reset) & reintalling Snaochat, mine was the same as before I restarted it. Why can't my phone receive the update?",
      "It's my primary form of communication with close friends but it's incredibly buggy and doesn't register my camera sometimes? On my brand new 2020 phone? So I know it's not something wrong with my phone. Also super weird that the default volume control in the app if for my system and not my media. Aside from that, it's fun and pretty useful. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
      "Its a good app but when my phone's battery is lower then 20% the app is so slow. What I mean by this is it takes forever to load, snaps and chats don't send for like 10+ mins, and it ends up saying that's the camera wasn't able to open. I'm not sure if it's just my phone but they need to fix this issue because it's been happening alot more recently. (Phone is Motorola E5 play? I can't remember)",
      "It was great until the most recent update. Looked at reviews and others are having issues too. Nothing is loading and I can't talk to people at all. I can't see any of the snaps I get or conversations that are saved. I have to go to my friends list to go the the conversations because the actual list on the left hand side doesn't load.",
      "Just a bad app. The video calling is only in HD like 10% of the time, otherwise it's a pixelated mess. Also I see a \"reconnecting\" screen on a regular basis, even though my phone has 100% signal strength, and the call will randomly drop. The main function of this app barely works, so yeah, it gets one star."

      "This app only delivers an OK experience. It gets the job done. But there are many shortcomings. First of all, the UI takes pretty much space. Secondly, there is no night mode. In addition to these, this app lacks customization options. It constantly asks you to install Messenger. The story bar is huge. It stays open on background even if you force stop it.",
      "Once in a blue moon this app works properly, it's great when it works... But when you get an update for it, you always seem to have problems with it. Tech support seem to take ages to fix any problems on the app and they hardly ever answer back on your problem reports. I have just updated my phone with the new update and I wish I hadn't done it. It's been over a week now and still no fix on my problem and no replies or confirmation regarding my reports. Still waiting 😠",
      "Do remember to login at least one time within three months. If you forget to do, your account will be lock and unable to login anymore even you have correct ID and password. Although you can request for account recovery, but there will be no reply to your registered email inbox of whether your application is successful or fail. You can submit multiple time as you like, but you will never recover your account simply because customer service is not available.",
      "Last month I closed a page I had on FB in favor of my personal page. When switching, I was given only 2 ways to confirm my identity, one of which was unfeasible as it looks like a scam, the other was uploading my ID. Fast forward a month, still no help or response- it is impossible to get any help or customer service. I'm locked out of Facebook, locked out of Messenger, and there's no way to contact them for help when you're locked out! What an absolute garbage platform.",
      "Like the new features. Hate some things though. Well mostly one. Losing your messages or writing when connection is lost. It happened so much. It is not managed well. Offline work and caching and management should be well done. And no data should be lost. You are Facebook before anything. And Big five. I hope I.m gonna see that. Love too the Facebook react team hhh"

      "Does not respect the phones audio settings. My phone is on silent, and this is the only app that is still being loud with the notifications. Also, the app has not been updated in quote a few months (as of March 2020). Overall decent app. But it doesn't seem to be supported well. Good idea, could've been better implemented. Been following this app since the beginning. I hope it works out.",
      "Hey Devs! Great app so far... what's a party without music?? Solution: enable dual but separate volume controls for background \"media\" volume, and foreground \"voice\" volume! That way I can easily adjust the volume for my favorite streaming service while catching up and hanging out with my friends! It'd be like the double-decker couch of the app world! :-) thanks for listening, and keep up the great work!",
      "Lots of fun but occasionally suffers dropouts regardless of LTE or Wifi connectivity. Also - completely unable to access my Contacts in order to add friends (says \"address book is empty\") on two different Android devices- Pixel 3 XL and Galaxy Tab S3. No other app I have is unable to see my contacts, and yes permissions are enabled. Fix this, Life on Air.",
      "I have only been using this app for a few days now. Every is going as it should and I really like the app. But for a full 5 stars the game will need be a little more exciting. I really love the drawing game but we only played 10 rounds and we know almost every word. Give that some more content and a little more excitement and some content related to drinking and a lot of people would really appreciate that. :D",
      "I'm giving it a 2 star because I love this app over all, but everytime I swipe up to see my friends, it says \"connection issues\" even though I have good internet, and full bars. I tried restarting my phone many times and it still doesnt work for me.i cant join anyone's partys and no one can join my party. It says joining but then exits out right away. I aslo cant facemail anyone either. It goes to the camera and I try to take a picture but it doesnt work. Please fix this."

      "So far cashapp has been a pain in my side it worked well for a week, now I can't send payments receive payments or anything. I have contacted support and asked for a phone call but no! Email only. So, I have emailed them the past few days with the issues and am getting nowhere with them. For some reason my account appears to be locked down, and it will not verify my email, Picture ID, social or anything. I would not recommend this if you just dont feel like dealing with headaches.",
      "The best I use it all the time. So easy. I use it mostly with family. When I need a couple of bucks to hold me over until check day. Your money is added to your cash card in minutes. Oh I forgot to say you can get your own a debit card straight from the app. Pre signed for easier verification. 5* in my book. Now with all the upgrades bitcoin and now stocks options are being added to the app. Awesome!!!. no more trying to figure out on how to buy or even trade stock. #Lovingit!!! #Giveitatry",
      "cash app is good but not great. Very often I get stuck on a page I didn't want to go to and can't get out of. Although payments are quick and easy, sometimes there are glitches and it is difficult to get timely help. Today I bought bitcoin. Easy. I sent it in payment for something. It never arrived. Not only that, but the transaction did not show up in my transaction list so I can't prove it. But the bitcoin certainly DID disappear out of my wallet. The amount missing is $201 USD. I wrote to support but it will take 24 hours to get a response. I am not happy.",
      "Well, this app and I have had our struggles that's for sure. I was the last of the cash first kids to not understand the basics of checking accounts, debts, credit s, etc. But I have always liked this app because of its popular brand recognition and by how hard it is to hack into the account IF you don't know a whole lot about the basics of the weakness of passwords in general. One thing I do not like, is how it isn't clear you need a square account on a separate device",
      "Very convenient, VERY FAST, & very low fees. Way better than Google Pay. Google Pay allows previous money that has been sent months before intentionally, to be credited back to them (even though they were legit transactions). That's allowing fraud, & now they show a negative of thousands. I would highly encourage to use CashApp instead."

      "Bad impression coming back to use the app. 1. I had an old phone number on the app and was not able to change it because you need to verify the old number before changing to new one. They should change the system so it verifies other ways such as send an SMS message. As a result I couldn't contact my driver. 2. App does not show driver details such as car colour and model. It also did not accurately show the location of the driver which makes finding the driver difficult.",
      "I love using door dash but the app isn't working. I had to go on the website to even gain access to order. Any time I sign in on the app it immediately acts like it took it and starts the process all over again. Not thrilled with that. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling a bunch of times it just doesnt work for me. Can someone please work to fix this thank you!",
      "Terrible app. For some reason over 30 restaurants don't show on my app that are open and available but they show on my friend's app. I can't even search for them. They're just not there for me. Another issue is that literally half the time the app doesn't take card payments. This is a common occurrence myself and multiple people I know have been dealing with. Also, they don't tip their drivers (at least not until people called them out on it). Awful company.",
      "Very buggy. Shows a list of available promo codes at checkout, but when you tap one, it says \"Failed to apply promotion.\" Tried repeatedly with no success. They also move part of the delivery fee into the \"Taxes and fees\" section, so that it looks at a glance as if you're paying less for delivery than you really are. All in all, Doordash provides a frustrating experience compared to their competitors.",
      "Well I like the app itself, the layout and how it works but am very disappointed with the actual service and with the customer service. Tried to speak with an agent through the app and nobody answered and I waited for 20 Minutes! Will definitely be deleting the app but it was worth the try..."

      "Hulu live TV no ads it's a joke, every show I tried to watch has commercials. I cancelled, then resubscribed to get Hulu no ads for $11.99 a month, most all of the shows are actually commercial free. The only problem is the library is limited. ABC, NBC, and FOX shows are great with no ads. They have the current episodes, as well as classic TV shows. You have to wait until 2 am the next day to watch new episodes. You can watch General Hospital after 5pm the same day, which is cool .",
      "Hulu is great when it works, but that's only sometimes. The app is laggy and slow, plenty of weird errors, sometimes it just refuse to start. Poor customer service, almost no feedback when something goes wrong which is often. LiveTV crash or just refuse to work, and more commercials than you expect to see, especially if you pay for \"Hulu (No Ads)\" Will be looking elsewhere. I spend more time watching the free streaming services more, just because I'm sick of fighting with Hulu to get it to work correctly.",
      "Used to be good. They went and changed the entire home page platform which isnt helpful or pleasing. Only way I can look through the episodes of a show is by searching it, which is time consuming. If i turn it off and then on it starts the show over from the previous episode even if I'm on the next episode. Used to not have adds and now all of a sudden I do ( i pay for my membership).",
      "Love this app. Beat the area cable company by a mile. Always something to watch and the DVR is amazing. Just one problem the past few days. It has started to buffer a lot. Thought it might be a device cleaning issue. But cleaning doesn't help. Hoping the new update will take care of this. Other than that, I love this.",
      "Mixed Bag. The programming, cloud recording, and price are great. Cons include VERY frequent app crashes on LG Web OS TV even with hard wired data connection, no picture in picture when accessing program guide on LG TV, and overall a slow to respond app on LG TV. It seems many, many people have the same issues. App seems geared for mobile devices and desktops primarily. Address the app issues concerning smart Tv's and it would be a five star service."

      "This was the best. Since I've had my Note 10+, about a month, this app was working great. Why did you have to ruin it? While there was room for improvement, the new channel listing stinks. In portrait, the picture shrinks to a ridiculously small thumbnail, if you want to browse through the list while watching something else. Show info is gone. Often,the list is mostly blank. But worst... the show's are constantly buffering. Thanks for breaking what really didn't need fixing.",
      "Latest update looks nice, but it's missing a key feature and the usability has decreased. (1) Favorites are missing. (2) Vertical categories requires more scrolling and tapping than the useful horizontal menu. (3) Last channel viewed is not remembered after closing and reopens to a different channel. (4) Picture-in-picture no longer works. Despite these issues, this is still my favorite TV app.",
      "It's a good way to watch TV on the PS4 but could not activate it with my android device. Opened app, logged in, went to my pluto, but nowhere to enter my activation code. Looked everywhere on the app but did not find the activation and ended up frustrated. Only reason I downloaded this on my phone and created an account was because it said I would be able to use my phone as a control but, a little hard to do that when pairing doesn't work. About to uninstall this from my phone",
      "I definitely don't like the updated version of the Pluto TV at all. It takes too long to start. It doesn't restart on the previous channel that you watched. I can't change the channel like the older version. I have to turn off the Pluto TV to get to a station that I like. I'm thinking about uninstalling the Pluto TV app. It doesn't list the shows anymore on the updated version. What happened to the Wahlburgers TV Show in the 300s channel? Overall I'm Very Much Disappointed in the updated version",
      "Worked great until it updated, use to load up fast and not freeze, now it lags, the color guide was better than the black and white guide now, pictue is clear I must say, I know it's free, but if it's not broke, don't fix it. I do recommend this app for an alternative to watch tv on the go."

      "Terrible navigation, terrible suggestions. When we do a search, the app can return 1000+ results but stops scrolling after 25. Suggestions for rental or purchase continue even after filtering only movies included with prime. Navigation works differently on different devices even though the OS is the same. There may be a good library in there, but it is hard to tell...",
      "I love almost everything about this App BUT... I hate that some series are missing episodes randomly during a season or whole seasons are unavailable. I would really like to watch season 1 of some series before starting on season 2 or 3 but they are not available for viewing, defeats the idea of binge watching. Great selection, just missing a few odds and ends.",
      "Not working at all. Each time I've started the app there is an error \"Unknown_marketplace_for_user\". I've tried to restart app, cleared cache, navigate through the Amazon app but only to keep crashing when it launches Prime Video. I've also logged out the Amazon app, and login directly in Prime Video then I'm prompted to enter CAPTCHA and OTP. After completing the process, I've tried to login and was prompted again for CAPTCHA and still not working. Tried to contact support but waited too long.",
      "Really bad experience. Absolutely unorganized library and very bad settings options, no way to manually change video settings, I have to watch everything in fluctuating video quality, absolutely unstable. Did a mistake to subscribe for 1 year. They are not accepting my card for free trial of 30 days. Plz think before wasting money.",
      "Every single time I attempt to open the app (after uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, etc.) it tell me there is an \"issue with my account, when clearly there is no issue as I have not even SIGNED IN to my account yet when this happens, as well as the fact that I can use amazon video perfectly fine on my other device (not the app, on a Chromebook) so the only explanation is there is some inherently wrong with the app. Basically, this app is useless."

      "This goddamn stupid app. I try to open games through it and the screen goes into landscape view and back to portrait. That's all it does. And then dumps me out of the app. Also, for the last year and a half I've been constantly told that this app is required to play certain games. But it isn't. It's just another greedy data-mining exercise by Google so they can avoid paying any taxes and carry on being the world's biggest spy agency without any oversight. You suck, Google!",
      "Love Design Home. With a few changes they could be fabulous. I have learned many things about decorating and find the information from professional decorator's. However those much needed changes are few and far between. Such a shame! With the right incentives and making paintings, plants, and other decorative items accessible with diamonds and play cash. This would be add more opportunties to purchase those items. Otherwise real world currency is needed to keep decorating rooms. Its unfortunate",
      "This game at the beginning was bad now it's pretty good but still just so many issueslike as soon as you play it the controls just don't don't if you're going to make a game make it right please f******because I'm tired of playing just seen this do not install worst game in the it's a bit better now but still controls don't work fix that and you might have a good game for now I suggest you go to hills of steel 2",
      "Hello Development.. I am using this great program from the great Google company,And I think one of its advantages is keeping progress in games,And when entering compatible games, the game is registered in the profile,But the problem is that when I log in, nothing happens ,, I don’t know how to save progress or download a copy of saved data, to install my progress ,, the problem is that I don’t understand how it works ,, My device A10 Can you please reply as soon as possible?",
      "I have been using this app for 4+ years and it has (mostly) saved my progress on the games I have installed. Now in this recent update, ALL of my progress have been erased for more than 20+ games! An the worst part about it, it says I'm signed into all my apps, but when I try signing in to Play Games, it won't even show my progress at all. So if your planning on having an app that sometimes DELETES all of your 3+ years work of time of playing games, then I would recommend it to someone who is willing spend money to get your progress back after this app has been on for 45 minutes. Also BTW I deleted this after I made this review :)"

      "I was able to find pretty much everything I was looking for and it was convenient. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the app wasn't working to let me join the Express membership. I tried time and again to sign up for the monthly membership but the little circle loading sign was all you saw and it stayed that way for over 10 minutes! I even tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling but it still didn't work.",
      "Great concept and platform. One issue that I have is that I will not receive messages from the shopper until after the food is delivered. E.G. the shopper had a hard time finding the coffee I requested and tried to send me messages and pictures of the different types of coffee available, but I did not receive the messages until the trip was complete, even though I was on the app during the shopping trip approving other replacements and refunds. The messages were time-stamped during the trip.",
      "The service is amazing I love instacart so much. The shoppers are super friendly and they are very good at grocery shopping. It is unfortunate that the app doesn't work well.. I think the company should invest more in it. - it freezes and I reinstall it often - it doesn't report an accurate delivery time, often my shopper shows up 15 minutes before anticipated - sometimes the app doesn't respond when I add new items to the order especially on mobile",
      "Android app unusable if not using Google pay; get all of your groceries together (which is sort of painful), go to check out, get ads for stuff in my cart (WHY), then can't check out because I literally am UNABLE to enter in my credit card billing address on the Android app. I had to go on a laptop to finish the order. You have ONE job, to take my money. Oh, and I cannot believe I have to wait five days for pickup. I know it is weird times, but five days?",
      "Great! But not perfect.. As others have previously mentioned, the search engine has its glitches. Often offering me what I was originally searching for as a replacement item. Also it doesn't allow you to cancel individual store orders when shopping from multiple stores when you're at the checkout! I was faced with this annoying issue when I realized one of the stores I was ordering from was going to be delivered 2 days later than expected..I had to individually remove every item off that list"

      "I accidentally created an account with my phone number, thinking I was adding it to my already-existing account. Unfortunately, that now means (according to Microsoft customer service) that my phone number can never be associated with my account, even if the accidentally-created account is deleted. One little mistake on my end that any other business would be able to fix now means that this app is less than useless for me. :/",
      "This is a very bad application, I installed this application 5 month ago, they asked for a credit card information. I used if a few days and the App says the first month is free. After that few days I didn't use it anymore but they have charged me for 4 month. They didn't send any in-app notifications for charging or emails, despite the fact that they have already the email. On the other side , the settings is a complicated one and you can't find where to go for cancellation.",
      "This is a great app, since I started using Android phone, I have used Skype since then and the best thing about it is video and audio are very clean, which gives good quality, I like it. By using its app and I will always be in touch with it and I hope that things will come up on the sky better and the process will work and on the sky is the very good app,",
      "Terrible - This app does not work on my android tv box. Skype has downloaded but will not allow me to reach the sign in page. A pop up error message suggests checking my internet connection but there is nothing wrong with my WIFI or Ethernet connections. I guess I'm going to be even more socially distant from my family than planned.",
      "They eat up the money you load after a while. They send you email saying if you do not log in, you will loose your credit. If you miss to log in, it totally disappear. There is no way of talking to someone or getting an email address to send message. You are going looptiloop for hours on their site and find no way to contact them."

      "This is an update to a review I wrote on March 15 regarding the issues I was having with this app. I uninstalled it off all my devises and reinstalled it. It is still a little temperamental on tab, takes longer to open and switch between learning activities, but works great on the others. My 4 year old, who could read before this, has really mastered some the reading exercises. I had to put her in the 1st grade level of learning. My 2 year old is good at math and has really benefited from the math games. If you are having issues you may want to uninstall and then reinstall the app. Also, check your security settings, they can delay your app response times.",
      "I usually don't write reviews but man has this experience been frustrating! I signed up for ABCmouse due to the corona virus to get the kids learning something while they're at home quarantining and it has been a nightmare! The main issue is that the app consistently freezes. No matter what! I have to close the app and reopen to get it working again and then sure enough, they tap on something and... You guessed it. Frozen again! Not sure if you understand exactly how frustrating it is to have a 3 and a 5 year coming to you every 5 minutes screaming \"It's not working again!\" especially when you yourself are working from home or in a meeting. I'm definitely not continuing my subscription and would advise anybody else to look elsewhere until they get some solid developers on their app.",
      "DECEITFUL. I saw an offer for a month's free trial after downloading app. However, I had to provide my credit card details to gain access to the month's free trial. I chose the yearly subscription which I believe would only come into effect after experiencing the month's free trial.To my surprise they immediately charged me for the year. Is this how a free trial work? That's not free trial it's a month free. False advertising. Extremely dissatisfied. Opening app and loading content is slow.",
      "Terrible. Is it better than sitting your kids in front of cartoons? Yes. But by a smidgeon. The claims that this enhances literacy, math, etc, are absolutely ludicrous. There's indeed a ton of content, but it's absolute rubbish. Especially noteworthy are the UX, which is an unmitigated disaster, and the technical issues (on what's otherwise a really low-tech game app), which are positively dismal, both on the app and the web version. Don't fool yourself for a second thinking that this has any sort of educational value, on any conceivable level.",
      "App freezes A LOT ! Or simply will not load . Should definitely make an update to it because it is VERY frustrating . Spent about $69 a year on this so my son could learn while I am working from home and he doesn't have access to my computer while I work so I figure this would be great for his tablet . It doesn't work on his tablet because it freezes or just simply won't load, so I put it on my phone and yup does the same thing . Looks like I am not the only one with this issue . Not happy."

      "So bad is not even funny. Instead of being able to voice chat on the switch like every console produced in the last decade you need this app. Instead of working like every other Voice chat app instead Nintendo decides when you can talk to people, which is normally when you are both playing the same game, but sometimes it just refuses to work. Completely unnecessary and completely broken.",
      "The fact that we have to pay for an online service that doesn't even include a built in communication system is mindblowing. The Wii had a better online service TWO DECADES AGO! With that being said, the fact that this App is even required is a joke. An even bigger joke is that the App won't even work, let alone open... Nintendo please do better",
      "I think this is pretty useful but for Animal Crossing I was hoping for a more instant messager feel. It's a little awkward that I have to go back and forth between my phone and Switch just to see if my friend responded to my message. Also for the QR codes, a way to just upload a picture from our phone gallery of the codes would be nice.",
      "Works fine and as intended. The team builder for Super Smash Bros Ultimate is cool, but you can only build on the phone then need to go to your switch and have the team sent over when it's done. At least it's good for viewing shared content. Splatoon 2's splatnet is quite useful and the app does show your stats, but that's about it. I've never used the voice chat from the app, but it seems a bit odd since I'm using another app to talk anyway, so I wouldn't use this app's voicechat",
      "I got this just to download QR codes for ACNH. Why should I pay a subscription? QR codes were included in New Leaf. You cannot expect people to pay £50-£60 for a triple A release title to then lock a feature that was included in an older game behind a pay wall. I don't even want Nintendo switch online. I JUST want QR codes! 😭"

      "Pandora has always been a favorite app of mine and my family. Easy and clean interface and the premium membership is a decent price for all that comes with it. No complaints other than the \"sleep\" option. I've had Pandora for awhile so I might be mistaken but isn't \"sleep mode\" only offered in Premium membership? I feel that should be a free option and sorry if I confused the app with a different one but would be a knock of mine. No big complaints and easy to use!",
      "The app itself (not the service) seems good, but one complaint: When I'm logged in on the computer, and then I try to login on the phone, it asks me if I want to let the other person listen or take control. There should be a third option, which is to listen to whatever they are listening to. That way I can be logged in on two of my devices listening to the same thing at the same time.",
      "This app is good for on the go music, but the app keeps on deleting my playlists and bringing them back. When I try to listen to music, there is this thing where I press the music on the playlist and instead of loading, it skips through all the songs without me doing anything. There must be some sort of glitch, so please fix this!",
      "Great quality and range of music but the app will consistently close each and every time a \"trial period\" expires and that greatly limits the ability to keep working while listening to the stations. Troubleshooting doesn't appear to remedy this situation so I presume it's either intentional to nudge a premium subscription (I already pay for Plus) or it's a bug in need of immediate fixing.",
      "It's nice to be able to find (almost) all of my favorite songs. Unfortunately, the app randomly stops playing my playlist and flings me back to the last station I was listening to CONSTANTLY. Then I have to sit through ads before I can go back to what I actually wanted to listen to. Fix please, or I'll just get spotify instead. It's not worth the frustration."

      "I love discord, and use it every day. But the only complaint I have is the changes (currently) to the appearance on mobile. It doesn't entirely make sense? And it feels uncomfortable. Like swiping left to see the members in a group now has that overly large box. Likewise with servers. I'm aware you put the pins and such there, but why? There wasn't entirely a reason it seems, I've never seen anyone complain about it. It was easier to navigate without having a large box covering the chat.",
      "I love this app on my phone and computer. Excellent for connecting with gamer friends!! I could go on and on about how much I use and love this app, but I just want to write my one compliant about it. My only issue with Discord is the infamous \"robot voice\" that people get occasionally. Besides that, excellent job Discord! Also, thank you for being free :)",
      "Hello Discord, I don't really have any problems with it. Chat, call, make your own group chat or even video call. You can really do everything on Discord, but there is one thing that sticks out to me, that is... Friends list, it does it in a sort of, weird way, it puts group you've made and not in the groups list, but it's a good way to chat with friends.",
      "I love it, really. There is a vast number servers to explore and join (you can make your own server/s too) and so many people to meet and/or make friends on there. The only issue that I had though, is that it wouldn't notify me at times when someone has messaged me, but other than that, my overall experience on this app has been great thus far😄😁",
      "This app can be a masterpiece when it actually wants to, but honestly it seems like it doesn't even try. There's always some problems, either i can't hear other people or they can't hear me. Usually restarting the app does the trick, but not even that works anymore. Dissapointing. Please fix this, cause it could've been a 5 star rating."

      "Premium member and was worth every penny until the last day or so. Keeps stopping music during playback, especially when trying to use the app in background. Cant get 30 seconds into a song without it stopping, then I have to go back to the app, hit pause and then play again. Only for it to happen again a few minutes later. Also cannot view artists, only get a \"something went wrong\" error. Fix your app and I will go back to 5 stars.",
      "It seems like after every update there'll be random issues, not even immediately. Since the last update, it was totally fine, but all of the sudden I can't view artists. No matter how many times I press \"Try again\" the pop up reappears immediately. It'll probably go away soon, it better, but it's annoying to have to deal with something new everytime there's an update",
      "Editing playlists should be easy. It's very tiring when you're removing some songs from your playlists. It requires me to tap so many times just to remove one song. Can't that be made in such a way that you can remove multiple songs? Please consider.. thank youuu. For some reason, I get logged out and I can't log in again. I have to install and uninstall and download all my songs again. Please fix. Thank you.",
      "Originally, I would give spotty a 5 star all the way. Now, 2020 it has gone downhill. I don't know if it's just because I went from premium to a free account. Viewing playlists is a joke, completely garbage (not an opinion 100% fact). The ads are relentless and layout needs to be fixed. Spotify you had an awesome thing and I was happy to pay for it. As it is now it's not worth $1",
      "Spotify has been amazing for me until recently when it began to just stops playing music after 10 seconds of every song. The app doesn't crash or freeze, it just stop playing music. Its so irritating. I think it has something to do with the network because when the phone is connected to wifi it doesn't stop. I currently use Samsung Galaxy S8 on Vodafone network. I tried switching to iphone but it had the same problem. Maybe it has something to do with Vodafone. Please guys fix this!"

      "Best photo editing apps than all other apps in .I tried maximum editing nd photo filter app...But I felt that this app is really great,You try then you can understand ,Don't expect a refund. Didn't realise I didn't cancel the free trial and immediately requested a refund as I won't be using the features via the email address given. Not even a response from them.",
      "This is the best photo app I've ever had. It's so easy and simple to make effects and to add photos. And the photos save eith a nice high quality! Only just started to play with this. Seams fine so far. The paint bit could have more options for covering up bits you want to hide in a picture.",
      "very stupid images to send to your friends, especially for a free app. The adds are not very intrusive and you can very easily shitpost,Doesn't ask for permissions. Has many, many options for photo editing. I use it a lot. Not much else to say other than it's free and it works well",
      "would be good to have in app storage for faster re editing of photos for the paid for version. Instead of having to redo original photo,I've just started using this app it's really great, but I do wish it had more features for your face besides stickers and all that like what they have for your body",
      "Not a good editing app. Has some basic filters and stickers and borders. Has ability to crop. That's about it. The only good thing is, when it tried to pop up ads, they wouldn't actually load. The home screen is a mess and doesn't really work either."

      "Looooove Marco Polo. Love the ease to use the software, whether you're techy or tech-averse. The only thing I would like would be different filters. I'm sure that makes things more complicated or more difficult, but I hardly use the current ones cause they're pretty basic (and kinda lame [sorry]). Other than that feature lacking, I would have given them a 5 star.",
      "Love that I can connect with people I haven't seen in years!! I can watch the videos as they are talking to me or later. Really love that it reminds me if i have a message I haven't watched yet! Especially now its great for my kids to use to stay in touch with their cousins since traveling is a no go with covid-19.Haven't had any problems at all and been using it for 4 months now.",
      "Actually love the concept, but it sent texts to people in my contacts, which I cant have happen. I have a lot of my customers and coworkers in there, so had to delete account. I get it's trying to spread its name, but I would have actually told people about it, if they didn't do that. Edit: The app developers worked with me to explain how to disable the contact permissions, but still be able to use the app. Thank you!",
      "It is like having a fantastic conversation but on your own time. Even if your grandkids want to tell you something but you aren't available they can leave as long of a video conversation as they want and it is sent easily and quickly and can actually be watched and reacted to in REAL TIME! This simple app is a communication miracle !! So easy to use.. videos can be saved for later viewing or forwarded. LOVE IT!!!",
      "60% of the time the record feature doesn't work, says something went wrong, so I send a problem report each time. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, updated my phone, the app, and still won't work when I try to record. I've taken these steps several times and have to restart my phone every time I want to send a message to someone. It's the most frustrating messaging app I've ever used."

Nothing but the same \"oops\". This isn't an Oops, especially AFTER an update meant to address these issues! I have NO way to communicate with my child's teacher especially now that he's out for 2 weeks!",
      "I have used this app for a few school years & enjoyed it but about 2 months ago it gave me an error message & stopped sending/recieving texts. I've uninstalled/reinstalled it but now I get an error message to try again to log in later. I've tried it on a different device. I've tried to request a password reset but that failed also. Is there anything else I can try?",
      "Horrible! Why fix what wasn't broken? I have used Dojo for years. I have told everyone about it. Now that you have updated it, nothing works right. Yes, I uninstalled and reinstalled. I have signed out and in. Nothing is right. If I wanted my app to spin a blue circle for hours then this would get 5 stars. I need it to work regularly as my students depend on it and this new version is erratic at best.",
      "This app is an amazing tool to keeping in contact with your kids teachers. I was having a problem with my app, deleted it, reinstalled it, and even updated it (waited for an update) and still had problems. So I emailed Class Dojo and they helped me to get it working properly again! Thanks to Rachael with customer support!!!"

So since I don't have a phone number I then tried to go to the forms page of Twitter and file an appeal but to file an appeal you have to sign in to your account which makes no sense.",
      "Everyone should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, PRIVACY and FAST. Overall it is good. But there is a serious bug in this app. I have Twitter in couple of devices including Windows. When there is new messages, I open the windows app and see that message, and even after replying to that message, it shows the same new messages notification in my mobile too. Say that I didn't use my phone app for a week, but used the windows one",
      "Great app overall, but there is a bug with Android, or at least Google Pixels. When I post any media, it blocks it as sensitive content and I have to click \"view\" to see my own pictures. This doesn't happen when I look at other accounts, only my own. I use Twitter for my business, so this got annoying very quickly. It's been happening for at least a year.",
      "Firstly , the app get crashed and have bug where i cannot search anything in the search bar. It keep saying that something went wrong . So i reinstall the app back hoping that the problem have been fixed.  Unfortunately , it goes the same thing again and i tried to clear the app cache and even clear app data but it still freezing . I am really begging to you to fix this as soon as possible. Besides that , i wish that you can add Blue Mode on Twitter because Android user have a black background.",
      "Twitter has been logging me out of all accounts I manage (mine and those of other corporate organisations) in the name of trying to verify if I am a robot. This is becoming annoyingly frustrating as I am presently logged out of my personal account and the app has been unable to call me to verify that I am human. This phone-call option and the option to sign out are all that I'm given access. I use this opportunity to call on Twitter to please fix this issue. Thank you."

I've searched through every tab and category in the app and it's still not there. Where have they gone?",
      "This app is clunky, frustrating, and slow. Whether it's between info not displaying correctly, to crashes (on my Pixel 4XL), to just how slow and confusing it is to browse product listings, reviews, and essentially everything you need for a good shopping experience. Many times I just swap to my computer after failing with the app.",
      "Useless updates have made the app much less useful for me. First was the infuriating bug that made categories selection in deals a pain. Next Amazon removed the daily deals from the Programs and Features area AND have buried it so deep you can't find it without finding the Deal of the Day. If they're doing this to decrease the amount if shopping people are doing on Amazon, then it's working. Roll back your changes and don't change things that already work without a need.",
      "Updated from 5⭐'s to 2⭐'s. I've used this app for years without any issues but recently it's been running EXTREMELY slow. Especially when viewing product details, when there are options to choose from. Takes a minimum of 15-20 seconds before you can scroll through the photos of a product with options and another 15-20 seconds anytime you change an option to view it. It's really becoming quite frustrating. eBay doesn't do that.. just saying. Needs to get the bugs out of the last update and soon"

      "Not a good 1st experience. The app asks you to indicate parking spot number and color of car when you park in pick up spot. I selected both, but there is no \"enter\" or \"ok\" button, and my selections kept reverting to default (and wrong ) car color and spot number. I sat there for 30 minutes, while others came, picked up groceries and left. I started getting anxious, thinking my groceries were given to someone else. I began to think \"You always get screwed in the drive thru\".",
      "Cant checkout now, says \"we're having problems, try later\". It worked well before last update (2 hrs ago). Edit:2 days later, multiple attempts, still can't check out, only now the problem is that the app only gives me 1 time to reserve & then that time slot expires because I can't complete the checkout &it tells me to choose another time/day, only to give me the same single time slot on the Following day...it and in, stuck in a loop.😠",
      "Great app. Works well and fast. Only issue I always seem to have is that it I choose my parking spot and color of car once I'm there, there's no \"save\" or \"update\" button. If I click to go back in to see if it saved, it's reverted back to the default. One time I had them call me and ask where I was; maybe it was due to them not being able to see what I had selected on that parking menu.",
      "Over the past month has started to lag, freeze, and crash. Cant complete an order on the app without having to close it several times. Used to use it to shop a few times a month and now I can't use it nor do i want to anymore. Update: Not crashing anymore, but I cant update my parking location. Very frustrating.",
      "This app and service is a lifesaver! Literally it has made social distancing possible and helos keep my family safe by eliminating trips to grocery stores. App is easy to navigate,walmart saves all past purchase under favorites so that it makes future orders fast! Ty to my local fl. Daytona area employees for shopping and preparing my families items every week. Even through this Pandemic i have had no trouble with scheduling deliveries and pick ups! Super grateful for this app!"

      "This app could be a lot better. If you are in multiple different groups/classes, it doesn't allow you to push text notifications on which ones you want. You either get notifications via text for every single group you're in or none at all. Super annoying as I don't want nor need texts to be pushed through for every group I'm in! When you email tech about this or anything else, they're super unhelpful and won't actually address anything you asked about . Truly wish I didn't have to use this app!",
      "I use Remind for spur-of-the-moment communications with my university students. It works perfect in these kind of situations. My only complaint is that part of Remind could be geared toward college and university students. For example, the icons are clearly geared towards primary and secondary education. Unless I haven't figured out how, which could be the case, I would love it if things like the icons could be personalized or have more options that could be for college-level students.",
      "My experience with this version and the apple version were completely different. When i am typing the last few messages is hiding behind the keyboard. Not only that the app doesn't really send me reliable message notifications, yku can expand but if it's longer than the first line it won't show, it also doesn't show if they're read. Messages don't appear when the notification does. It's a very frustrating experience and I would like it if it were fixed.",
      "Its an incredibly helpful app, however it is incredibly frustrating how slow it is to send messages to teachers. Even with my own personal data, with good connection, it takes really long. I hope they fix this, or the whole purpose of communicating with teachers fast is not happening.",
      "Very great for school, but one key problem: If I were a teacher, I would want to delete old groups or messages that aren't wanted. Unfortunately, there is no way to delete messages or groups. It is great, near perfect for school communication, but I just wish there could be a way to remove conversations. Other than that, its a really great app!"

      "Superb interface - Garbage Stability: This app is by far the most intuitive and beginner friendly option I've encountered. Unfortunately, the stability of the trading system is straight up garbage. Users were locked out of their account for the entire day of March 2nd, 2020; and the first half of March 3rd, 2020; during which the S&P 500 bounced up 8% from it's previous weeklong plummet. Do not trust this company with critical day to day trades, they have no qualms about shutting down the system",
      "So I figured I would give this app a try. Not looking good. It kept telling me it's losing connection, and then its having a server issue. Right after I put ALL my information in. Wont let you look at stocks. Just sends you to a blank page. So far this has been a horrible experience. Not sure I would invest money into this if you cant even navigate the app properly.",
      "So far this app is a major disappointment. The platform is solid. The problem is, it is extremely glitchy during peak hours. Which makes its users lose money. I keep getting server errors and apparently I'm not the only one. I've looked it up and many other users are having trouble with the glitches as well. If it continues I will no doubt pull my money out.",
      "Can't even really get started with the app. I have been trying to link my account. I have tried multiple times over the course of 24 hrs. I keep getting a message \"oops we can not ....\". I have checked the help section and couldn't find anything that directly addressed it (it is not the 1 factor authentication either). I have sent a message to support in 24hrs have only got the immediate auto reply. The app seemed like the best choice after reading various articles but it's useless with the bugs",
      "Decent app for buying/selling but its features are still pretty limited. That said, their customer service is a joke. Tried to cancel a transfer to/from my bank. I had to send an email and was advised a wait time of 1-3 days before someone would get back to me. 3 days later no response, except a new automated message stating my transfer was in process now and I can no longer cancel it. What a joke."

      "This app is pretty cool. Really have only one issue and that is when I open the text window and press the arrow(enter) button via Google onboard keyboard. What I expect to happen is the keyboard to disappear. If I tap anywhere outside the keyboard disappears. When you have time would you please and add a \"X\" box. Thanks in advance. MICHAEL",
      "This is one of my favorite apps. I always lose my remotes and the roku app always works perfectly from literally anywhere in my house. So For example if I am on my back porch I can press play and my kids show will start. It's also really cool that you can stream the roku channel on your device with the app. I'm still kicking myself for buying a replacement remote last year before I knew about this app. It's so easy to use my three-year-old uses it to control his TV. Don't change a thing!",
      "It's great when it works, the private listening feature is particularly useful and just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it's buggy as hell and does not work most of the time. With private listening on the audio will often lag and sputter so much that eventually my phone will disconnect from the tv. No problems with connectivity when private listening is off, but that feature is basically my only use for the app. Sometimes sputtering audio will keep playing long after the video's paused.",
      "If I could make use out of the private listening feature it would have been a 5 star rating for sure! I can't seem to figure out how to use it and if I even can use it in the way I hoped to use it. At night when my family is sleeping and I don't want to bother them with the TV volume too loud I thought that I could nix that problem with the private listening feature but doesn't seem to work that way. Without that 1 issue 5 stars would be there without question!😞",
      "Half of the time it works, half the time it doesnt. It's handy to have when I lose my remote, but is constantly glitching. If I needed the app for more than a few moments at a time, like if I were to have lost my remote completely, I'd find it to be a nuisance. Which makes sense.. As a company, trying to sell products. It would be wiser to make an app more annoying than buying a new remote. In that same breath.. It's tolerable enough to ignore and laugh about to myself."

      "ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!! EVERY TIME I go to Wal-mart now it's simple, quick & easy to price check items using the in app scanner & paying with Walmart pay is easier, faster, more secure & instead of keeping up with paper receipts an easy to find digital receipt is stored in the app making the return process easier, faster & more secure too... In my opinion everyone in the world that even walks in a Walmart store should download this app if they can! I love it that much!!!",
      "The app is a bit buggy. The grocery app is way worse with bugs. But I want to be able to add things in my cart that are in the store only, not just things that are online. I say this BECAUSE the grocery app is buggy. Also, I'll click on something that says out of stock, and it's not, or something that isn't out of stock, but it is. This really needs to be fixed.",
      "Hands down the best all around Consumer Store/Shopping App. From being able to save receipts, start a return, or lookup items and their inventories at multiple locations (which is pretty accurate), to accessing services such as sending/ receiving money or just plain shopping without leaving the comfort of your own home Walmart has set the new standard for other department stores, and so far I haven't come across one that is anywhere near as beneficial in numerous areas as them!!",
      "I go to check out, see that an item isn't available for pickup today, go to edit my cart, and the last half hour of my time (which I could be using to unpack my apartment! ) was apparently wasted. The cart reset when I went to edit it, and now I have to go back and find all the items again. Thanks. Maybe look into this.",
      "Stock information isn't accurate. The search says item is available, but when you select it, it's out of stock. Named In-store aisles don't exist, then the item is out of stock. You can make lists, but can't set alerts for availability. You can't select delivery or pickup before you get into the shopping cart. It's confusing to see pricing you can't fix until you pay. And you should be able to scan your pickup barcode to check in. Not retype order numbers. App needs refinement."

      "I found and purchased several Items that I can use at fabulous prices. At first I thought that they only carried things I would never use, but I found they have things for everyone. Try hitting the find icon and you will be amazed. Their selection is vast. I found things I need right away and placed an order. Then I searched and found hundreds of things that I want, so after I pay my Bill's I can't wait to come back for more.",
      "Good, just frustrating and time waster at times.You think that you bought an item and then they tell you that you did not get it. Delivery is expensive, but overall a good experience. It doesn't really let you search for what are you looking for, so that is why I give 3 starts, and because of delivery. Quicker to purchase on other sites. Good, because you can see lots of different items if you have the time.",
      "Whenever I try to order my items, the transcation doesn't go through. It either says \"oops, try again\" or \"please contact your credit card..\" I am using a prepaid gift card and nothing is working. Not to mention you guys accept gift cards so what is there that is not going well? I typed in my information correctly and yet, it's still not accepting it. Plus, the prices on the items are off. For example, a shirt will say $7 but when you select your size, the price increases.",
      "It's a good app where you can get things pretty cheap. I wish there was an option to get rid of the items you already have bought on there. It'll pop up on the newsfeed more than once and it gets pretty annoying at times. It would also be great if when you click on something cause you don't know what it is, for that reason alone and not wanting to buy it, that it wouldn't pop up on your newsfeed anymore. That gets annoying real quick cause most of the time I don't want that item.",
      "You get what you pay for with some things. Watch out for blitz-buy that gives you a 20 minutes to purchase/view up to 100 \"deals\", it's just a ruse to get you think it's a good deal but if you look normally outside blitz then you will see you can get the same price without the stress since there are more sellers who got that item and sometimes it's even cheaper. Also watch out for \"earn 5% discount now if you order now\", it's just there to make you miss anything that might be wrong with the item"

      "Having my PayPal account, and PayPal Cash card has been very convenient and easy to use. I have ran into situations where I was looking to make a purchase and the only form of payment a seller or retailer would accept is PayPal. I love the fact that PayPal insures your transaction. Also everything about using My Card and PayPal account has been smooth and easy. Thanks PayPal!!!",
      "Almost useful apart from stupid login. Enter my password and it sends a code via text, read the text and it's logged you out of the App. Log back in and repeat the same thing again and again. Only way to successfully log in is to have texts open on my PC using Android messages. Even if I open texts on my mobile before logging into the App as soon as I switch to the texts it logs me out again.",
      "Can never use the app, every time after logging in, and entering code for 2FA, it goes to a blank screen with a X in the upper left corner. If I click the X, I have to login again and do 2FA code again, and then back to the blank screen. If I reinstall the app, it works maybe one time before doing the blank page thing again. I can get get into the app. It's been like this for months now. Nothing seems to ever really fix this issue, and many others seeing the same issue. Please fix this!",
      "I use PayPal for direct deposit from work, and I love it more than any bank I've ever been with. I have a card I can use anywhere in person or online, and the balance on the app is immediately updated so i always know exactly what's in my account. I'm also provided with a detailed list of what & when my expenses were. And money can be sent immediately to other paypal users. No waiting or fees. You can even create savings accounts or money pools. This is an incredible app & i adore paypal.🖤",
      "Good App. Works great for family, shopping, and even some bill payments. My only complaint is that funds received notifications have no option to transfer to your bank. Selecting any option from the notification closes the app instead of prompting you to login to continue. This could be streamlined. Maybe leaving the app logged in would remedy that, but that would be a security risk in my opinion. Every other aspect of the app seems awesome. It's a Must have."

      "Used to love this app until it became too coy! Stop pausing my music and asking after every second or third song \"are you still listening?\" YES!!, yes I'm still listening, the playlist is over 100 songs, not 3!! It's hugely inconvenient. I love listening to music while driving or cooking but this app makes that difficult when you still need to be interacting with your device when you shouldn't be! I haven't been convinced to pay for this service and as a result of this I never will.",
      "Outstanding app! The music library is amazingly vast. What makes this app/service stand out of every other streaming service in the market is the fact that it allows you to listen to published music as well as music on YouTube. This is a big plus, at least in my point of view, because there are tons of music videos, soundtracks and stuff like that which is not available anywhere else. The only place they can improve on is their UI and audio quality. So yeah. YouTube music is a 9/10 from me.",
      "Totally awesome! Especially when you consider that you get the premium version Free! w/ your subscription to Google Play music. Best deal in music by far. Plus it's just a great app. It has pretty much any song you can think of and most remixes. 4 example, the Pink - Get this party started/ Sweet dreams mix. I could never find it, but on YouTube music... Boom! There it is. And last, but not least they let you download the video or the song or both. Then you can switch between them. 👍🏻👍🏻",
      "Great music app. I use it as my go-to, since I pay for YouTube Premium and get ad-free listening on here as well. The only thing I have a problem with is that I wish it had more features. Spotify used to be my go-to music app, so there's a lot of features that I really miss from it like crossfade, normalize volume, and being able to control music on another device. Not to mention that Spotify has a higher maximum sound quality and and a better looking layout. I hope these features are added soon",
      "It's a good idea and for the most part I do like it. The reason I'm rating it so low is that it replaces songs on my playlist. If I add a song to my music playlist, it's because I want that song by that artist, singing that version. This app is really bad for replacing the song/artist/version with something else. Usually it's a really crappy rendition. For the record, I can go into the actual YT app and listen to the same playlist exactly as I made it."

This has been an issue with the app for about the last week. Have not made any changes to the phone app, just all of a sudden started getting \"undeliverable\" messages when sending emails on the phone app. Please fix!",
      "Okay app that stopped working. I chose this app when I switched from Samsung to the Pixel 3 in early 2019. However, it stopped working in the late fall - requesting that I reenter my password, then saying it needed to download messages. But, it would go back to requesting my password again. I see that others have had this problem and nothing has been done to address it for several months. Time for me to uninstall permanently.",
      "Reminder notifications unbearable. I schedule a one-off time to remind me of a meeting the day before it happens, which lasts for an hour. I click into it to acknowledge the notification. But the notification comes back up every minute of that hour. Infuriating, especially when I only want one reminder, not 60. My phone keeps vibrating every minute of that specific hour in the day.",
      "Works well enough but not incorporating biometric sign-in makes using it a tremendous annoyance. I actively avoid using Microsoft apps on Android because of this. I love using my Pixel 4xl and face unlock is better than the iPhone but Microsoft apps are my bane. I loathe having to enter my pin in EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Please, devs. Give your apps some love, I'm sure it's the same line of code for all of them to allow this. Many of my other secure apps have figured this out.",
      "No, I DON'T see what you see. Lol. Nothing different than it used to be prior to the most recent updates. I also wish that you wouldn't send all of my personal and important emails to my \"spam\" folder. If I press the \"not spam\" button, it should automatically move ALL emails from those same addresses directly to my main inbox. PLEASE fix & change this problem! Because it is a problem."

Cancel at the end of my billing cyle. It was supposed to be a 3 day free trial and as long as I cancelled I wouldn't be billed why should I be billed for something that's a hoax and doesn't do what its advertising it does ***DO NOT BUY",

After a few minutes my screen told me to pick a payment method and then I couldn't get out of that screen even though I was pressing the x. This was NOT a good experience. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP.",

      "Flat out hoax. Clearly made to get children to download and then out of frustration \"sign up\" past the blocking screens and thus get suckered into a subscription. Yes it does say it will cost after 3 FREE days. Here I wish I could make 'FREE' bigger and in bold font and make the 'it will cost' smaller and a light grey on a graphic background to ensure it cannot be seen or read... To devs and Google how about moving to a free trial WITHOUT automatic renewal. I propose this for ALL apps."

      "The app works just fine (there are a few things in their UI that I didn't like/needed to get used to, but it works). The service tends to be really slow, however. I recommend caution whenbuying anything that needs to be delivered quickly or can't be re-heated easily. On busy night, it can often take over an hour to get the food, so plan accordingly.",
      "After update Apartment number not displayed on address, it used to be. I often order from neighbor's apartments in my building so the address is only different by apartment number. Not, I can't tell which apartment's address is selected without going into the details of the address, which for some reason takes many seconds to load. This used to be a quick thing where I could see which apartment was selected. Now only the first line of the address is displayed at checkout",
      "App no longer works on my phone (Samsung Note 9+). I've deleted and redownloaded it multiple times now but it never gets passed the enter your address page. And even then it gives me an error saying it can't find the location even though it worked fine a few weeks ago. Only reason why I still have it on my phone is in hope that an update will fix it.",
      "The app itself is pretty solid. Love the ability to track the driver so there isn't that akward phone call and trying to find each other. I've had problems in the past with certain orders (getting cancelled on, delivery issues, applying promos) but I'm only taking off one star for those because most aren't within the app team's control. .",
      "Amazing app. Always reliable and does its job. Just one thing that it could improve on: Sometimes when tracking an order I'm unable to see the delivery vehicle on the map and when the time runs out the vehicle is still not visible. If that could be fixed it would be perfect."

      "It's a great app for the creative and non creative alike! It has a vast ocean of knowledge for the experienced and those wanting to learn...from cooking to fashion to decor, crafts, inspiring quotes, tips on almost everything, and so much more! There is some room for improvement, but overall it's my go to place for ideas, inspiration and knowledge!",
      "I love Pinterest more than anything. It has been my favorite app/website for about 5 to 10 years now, and that won't change any time soon. It's especially great for the organization you can have, but it's recently gotten worse. I guess the algorithm for homepages has been tweaked in a recent update since now I'm getting a lot of pins in different languages or for stuff I've never cared about. This is really annoying when the amount of ads everywhere is factored in. Please fix homepage algorithm.",
      "I hate that I open the app and see a pin I want to explore, but it's gone before I can click on it. Let ME decide when to refresh the page, please. Also hate that you took away the ability to add a caption when adding a pin, so that I have to go find it and edit to add a caption. That being said, I use the app constantly.",
      "This app is useful, but can you make a way to where you can delete or clear your home feed. For me it's kinda annoying because there might be a pin that you accidentally clicked on and now it's in your home feed. I would also like it if you had an option of clearing \"ideas for you\". Overall this app is rlly helpful, just plz add this soon😸👍",
      "TBH, It's great. It's a \"free for all\" platform. But Idk if this is a general issue, or it's just mine, but the app occasionally crashing and sometimes not responsive. And top of all it sometimes just doesn't start when I try to open it. Please fix it, i don't think this issue is from my phone cause I have games and they work just fine. Thanks"

Today I had a problem to where I was getting nonfictions but they did not show up in app. Please fix, then I will have five stars. Otherwise, clean, good, and useful for the time being. I also seriously appreciate the dark mode. And I essentially use the calling, I love it. Another annoying thing is that I can only show 15 second videos. Otherwise good! :D",
      "This is a great app. It REALLY does provide FREE long distance calling, WITHOUT having to earn credits! BUT, I have had THREE problems with this app; 1) Very often, I am not able to hang up, after dialing a number! 2) Quite often, after about two or three minues, the calls are cut off right in middle of my conversation! 3) There does not seem to be any technical support!",
      "Great App. I moved from the city to the mountains and couldn't get dependable reception. I was suggested this app and tried it out. It works perfect. As long as you have a WIFI signal you will be able to call receive calls text and pic message. I like it so much that I've upgraded to the $2.99 a month and plan and use this as a perment means of communication now.",
      "Meh, I had higher hopes for this app based on all the 5 star reviews, but was disappointed with my experience. Constant ads EVERYWHERE, sometimes multiple ads on one screen, and most of them take up half my screen, which is excessive, and beyond annoying. It frequently stalls on a solid black screen anytime I try to do anything, when u choose a contact it doesn't pick their default number, it picks the first number you added to that contact. Also, setting the background has never worked for me.",
      "It's a decent free text & calling app, which works over WiFi or Mobile Data equally well. I've also upgraded to premium, which improves the app's versatility, but the free service is a complete product without requiring it to be premium, like a lot of other text & calling apps out there. So, that being said, I bet you're like, \"He rated it 4☆ out of 5☆ though, what's the catch?\" The 4☆ rating is cuz to keep the same cell# from changing you must text or call at least once every 3 days or...poof!"

      "Its real cool because my first time on my phone I couldn't download anything because every time tried it said \"you don't have any storage on your phone. Please make space on your phone.\" But everything changed when I downloaded this app...IT MADE MY DAY!!!😂😭🙏 I really recommend downloading this app, you won't regret anything!!",
      "Haven't experienced results yet. I'm so tired of scanners interrupting whatever I'm doing so they can do their thing, even if they've done it five + times already that day. So I hope that this app will do what it says, and ONLY what it says that it will do. Three stars is not an accurate rating since I have yet to experience the results of the app.",
      "This really works...had numerous problems with my phone. Thought I was going to have to get a new phone. For those who complained about so many alerts about cleaning, there are many options under settings to stop auto alerts and cleaning. I have all auto models turned off and once a day choose what I want cleaned. It is fast easy. Lots of ads though, and thinking about getting the paid version.",
      "It's a good app with more cleaning parts that you really need for your phone. They deep clean getting junk files and other hidden files out of the phone so you have the free space then it's needed. This app surprised me on how well it really worked on my phone. So if you want a hard working, with all the right parts app give this one a try. It works great for me and it will work great for you too.",
      "I personally love this app because, it helps further clean up your Android like junk that was keeping up storage you didn't know was there. Furthermore, it also helps with apps that were using your battery storage that you didn't know was using phone battery. Also, this apps helps to make sure your phone doesnt overheat which is \"amazing\"! In conclusion, you should use this app if you have any problem with battery usage problems, overheat problems, or storage problems. Side note: also does more"

      "It was working very well for some time. However, for the last couple of weeks it keeps on freezing when I try to order. I usually can't even get my order out. It is this app specifically that is causing the issues. Another issue is that on multiple occasions the app tells me I have a coupon for a restaurant or free delivery, but then when I make my order it tells me the coupon doesn't work or is expired. Why advertise the coupon on the app to me if it is already expired? It makes no sense.",
      "I wish there were more discounts or rewards that i could benefit from. I dont use the app very often but when i do i tend to spend a good amount of money. Most of the things that are offered to me expire the following day or a few days later. Obviously its a way to convince people to spend more often but still sucks. Also wish they had more options.",
      "Several options don't match what the menus say. There are items that say they include a drink, but you have to choose a drink and be charged extra for it. Several options have only one selection that is required even if you would like to omit it. Someone should review menus thoroughly before releasing them. AI may be a good fit if you don't plan on paying anyone to do it.",
      "The app is generally okay, but it's very buggy with the campus ordering option. There are times my order fails to go through entirely because the app throws an error saying that \"this restaurant doesn't accept this payment method\" even though it's the OneCard option for a campus dining hall. Moreover, nearly every time I place an order, there are issues with the order timing out on submission so I have to place the order again. For reference, I'm using the most current version of the app.",
      "Good exceptional, it's good service but, can be a bit pricey after tip, service fee, taxes, etc. I'm a little lazy at times so paying the extra money is worth it. Over all, I like the experience, the app is very simple and easy to use, and I like simple. Grubhub is a great idea when you don't feel like going out and getting food at high quality places, just have someone else get it and deliver it for you. I like this app a lot."

      "The video quality and cross platform support is great. With that said there are a few really annoying issues holding this back from a higher score as of the time writing this. 1) You can't seem to add/invite people to an ongoing call. You have to exit the call, create a new group with all people, and the call that group. Really?!? 2) If you have a group call going and it dwindles down to two people it cuts the screen in half for each user instead of full screen with the person you are talking with and small thumbnail for yourself. Fix these two issues and this will be a 5 star app.",
      "I really want to like this app. It have good features, like the low light mode. It works great. But it lacks some fundamental features that it shouldn't. If i made a voice call, i couldn't req for a vid call immediately. I had to end call and call again. If i was in a vid call, i can't change to fon call, and i can't temporarily turn off the camera if i need to. If the other side ends the call, there is no tone to indicates the call was ended. Minor features, but fundamentally important.",
      "I have Duo installed on my android and am attempting to use it on my computer once in a while. When someone calls, it rings on the phone but does not ring on the computer. There is no notification that someone is calling, nor is there any way that alerts me so I can press \"answer\" and pick up the call. I added duo into my notifications on the web browser as the HELP menu instructed with no luck. What do I do next?",
      "Video seems to stutter & freeze much more than other apps like FB messenger or WhatsApp. This iccurs while communicating with others with good wifi at both ends. This forces us to move off Duo and into another app to communicate.",
      "Latest version not working for outgoing calls on my Galaxy S20. Not sure what was done but tried reinstalling the app. Clearing my cache and even resetting my network settings. Whenever I call anyone it just says immediately \"person didn't answer\". It only pops up the incoming call on the other end for about 1 second. The only way is to have them call me back to chat. Very annoying for someone who uses duo everyday. Please fix this Google!"

      "We LOVE EPIC! It helps us easily find books appropriate for my son's age as well as find books by themes that he is interested in. I love how some books are read to him while highlighting the words and how some are read for him to just listen to. It gives him fun access to books while we can't get out to the library during this virus for a VERY low price! He actually WANTS to read like 3 TIMES A DAY now! We have lots of books but I love letting him access books (appropriately) all on his own.",
      "Worked well on my phone initially, but on my tablet the start free trial option comes up no matter how many times I sign in, and also on my phone now. When I click this it tells me that its already activated and sends me back to sign in again. So, I can't access anything on my tablet or my phone, which was working earlier.",
      "Love the app but wish students could use at home. Also wish it was free for remote online learning and parents who choose to homeschool. Thank you! My students loved this site last year. Also wish it would extend to older grades as site is very easy to navigate. Sincerely Priscilla. Ps I just signed up for 1 month free and extra 30 day access for $7.99 . Ithought great time for grandkids to explore while most of us are at home during these trying times. Be safe my friends!",
      "I couldn't access to my account almost for a year. When i try to enter my account, there is some one month free page appears all the time. Now, i am really sick of it. This app charges $$ every month from my bank account. I sent email to support team, but i still haven't heard nothing from them. Also, i tried to unsubscribe on playstore, but it wasn't work . So, i don't want to spend my money on this useless app. Please, fix this problem.",
      "Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too."

      "When I downloaded I was turned off by the very large amount they charge ($59.99 for a year) you do get a free 3 day trial but if you don't remember to decide whether or not it benefits you or you like it then you just lost $59.99 for food and other bills~! On the plus side it is entertaining and I could see it be a great platform for musicians, dj and comedians! I would love to get to try the Dolphin Anymoji :-)",
      "So, I like the app, but i can't say i love it, when you get to do the face stuff, It has bad quality, so it is hard to make it look sad, so this app isn't bad, but i wish it had better quality, next, you can only use a few faces, and that is sad, you can't even play Jojo Siwa!😭😧😠 Stop making it to where you can use only 3 faces.",
      "I really like this app but, it is also laggy on my phone and I can barely see the settings, and when I stick my tongue out it doesn't, I am not trying to be mean but, can you fix that? Thank you! And I don't know if it is only laggy on my phone. Thank you!",
      "You can only do a free trial for three days!!😭 And then you have to pay $60 a year!😡😭 The bad thing is that I REALLY wanted this app, but nope! Way too much for an app... If the creators see this comment please make the app either cheaper, or ACTUALLY free..",
      "I love it, now I dont have to but an iPhone. Definitely not as great quality as an iphone. But I'm so impressed how this is the almost the same thing as iPhones. I love how you dont have to pay to use the thing, I like how theres free ones! Definitely considered for you guys to get this app awesome and I'm still amazed. ❤🥳"

      "I have been using Audible for many years and have purchased around 500 titles. I listen while I walk in my neighborhood, at the gym, on plane and automobile trips. I use the app almost as many hours as my email account. Finding Audible is one of the highlights of my life. I use it for enlightenment as well as entertainment. When cell phones became small and smart, I loaded mine with books from Audible. In my old age, I take it to the home of a sick friend and listen with him.",
      "This is a great audiobook app, with a major flaw (at the time of writing). The application will forget it's place when left for a while. For example, listening in the car on the way to work - then being left for a workday (or less) then when you launch the application again it thinks you're at the beginning. When you exit out and force close the app, then go launch it again it will pick back up. Frustrating to be sure, though. Otherwise, it's great.",
      "Works well for the most part. Only complaints: 1. You can't refund/return books in the app, you have to go to the website for that. 2. It's incompatible with one of my Bluetooth speakers. Not sure why Audible is the only app that has this problem but the audio volume wavers very noticeably one a specific Bluetooth speaker. It'll go from standard volume to less than a whisper, to back to normal volume all over the span of a few seconds. And it repeats this for any and all audio from Audible.",
      "Love the app overall. The one problem i have experienced is that every now and then when i return to the app, the audiobook position has been lost and has returned to beginning. I then have to skip forward incrementally to try to find my place. I have started using the bookmark feature regularly but this means turning the screen on every time. Hopefully this can be fixed in an update. Thanks.",
      "I absolutely LOVE Audible. I listen to it every single day. The quality is great, the price point is fair, & I have no complaints. One particularly nice feature that I only recently discovered was the book return/exchange option. It's super easy, & it's a very customer-focused concept. I think it's one of the best apps created, and a great way to feed your mind & soul."

It is not going to make you feel weird either because you don't have to do a video. And also it is great because you don't have to sign in to watch videos you can watch them with no account or a sign in so yeah this app is really cool and people who don't have it should get it. Anyway so I guess I should give it mabye a five out of five",

Thatswhy i likee this application..and enjoying to everyday or everytime ....🤩🤩🤩🤩 Thank u so much ...sir or madam ...",
      "Likee is very wonderful app, with lots of features.. I m very old user.. But plssss, don't compress the photo quality when upload it... It is disgusting.... Some user r try to upload something nice and informative... So, better don't compress the photo quality...",
      "Somehow using bots to like and comment on your videos is pretty annoying! The only likes and comments I get are by fake accounts i.e bots. Other than that the video effects for videos and photos are really cool!",
      "This app is very nice but it has to many Chinese people and half the people can't read the words I would like is to be more like tiktok I am hardly on this app. If your gonna have an app like tiktok make it like tiktok. Too many fake people on this app. Gets too boring add more thingS more trends"

      "I've just started and have completed my first two pictures. The art work is excellent. The colouring in is helped by the number you are working being highlighted in the picture. It also shows if you have finished all the spaces needing that colour with a circle completing itself around that number. My kids love it too. You can also enlarge to help get the tiny areas. Definitely recommend it to everyone.",
      "I really enjoy this game lots and lots because I like art and this game is really something that gives you another point of art instead of just going and have to go into the store and buy paper and colors and all of that you can just sit here get your iPad or your computer or your phone out and just tap on these little color item things to color and is really fun and nice enjoyable and when you get done with all of them you can go back and look at them and say oh my gosh I have did all",
      "I absolutely love this game, but it keeps glitching on me. I have almost 2,000 pictures colored (I've had the game for a while) and almost all of the things completed that give free hints. Then the game will glitch and it won't load the pictures that I've colored and it completely erases all of the things I completed so that I have to start them all over. I delete and redownload the game and everything will work fine for a few days then glitch again and I have to delete/redownload all over again",
      "Much improved and now very enjoyable. Suggestion: water mark on images needs to be smaller or eliminated. 6.27.2017 update This is the best \"paint by number' app I've use. Developer is constantly adding new content. Highly Recommend! I'm not associated with the developer and my opinion is my own. 03/20/2020 Use this app everyday. The developers continue to improve and add new picts. FB links give you option of obtaining new content. Developer ask for input from users and make changes, addition.",
      "I do like the pictures, it would be a really really good app if it weren't for all the ads. I hate how you have to watch a ad before and after a picture, I do like that most of them are skippable. My app also has a glitch, when I finish a color it doesn't highlight the new color. Normally it fixes itself quickly but sometimes I have to find the color before it will highlight itself."

      "Good quality and a pretty decent interface, but the ads are ridiculous. Most streams force you to watch a 30 seconds ad before you can actually start viewing what your use the app for. From there, it just gets worse. I've frequently been subjected to SEVEN straight ads of 15 to 30 seconds in duration. That means a few full minutes of interruption, which always come at the worst time of the steam and they aren't skippable in any way. Oh, and you'll see the same handful of ads over and over.",
      "Was good starting out. But now I can't see certain people for whatever reason. I can go to other streamers and see them just fine, but for one group which I also follow on YouTube as well as Twitch, I can hear them, but not see them. This is really irritating because I used to be able to see them, but after an update it leaves me with a black window. The streamers belive its because they're using iPhones and I'm using a Samsung, but that seems like a really stupid reason. Please fix.",
      "Great behind the scenes and you can multitask with a background window, which many will love. Also extra points go to this app cause this can livestream certain games others can't. The only reason that it doesnt have five stars is that it has a certain delay and its missing some features other apps have but if does i will be glad to fix this rating to five stars",
      "So the content is great. App works okay, if you sit your phone up, don't touch it, and preferably stream only audio. If you go into pop up, it will lag and sometimes just stop. It will lag and stutter all the time, no matter the stream. It loses your place in VODs for channels you're subscribed to while you're watching then if *anything* else happens on your phone, and now, it's been playing BLARING ads over top of streams I'm subscribed to. I'd love to list more issues but I'm out of space.",
      "Update on Feb 24 (recent) killed audio only and background audio play on my s8. It was working fine for months/years until the update yesterday. Hopefully some bug they can fix quik. Already tried reinstalling the app and nothing. Other than that it's been working fine. Will update when fixed. And yes background audio is enabled."

      "I just installed the last update and it did nothing to correct the small text! I can barely read my messages and the entire app text is very small!!! Still sucks!!! I also don't like the new tracking screen! I used to be able to click on the tracing number and it would take me to the carriers website and with a simple click I could receive shipping updates on my orders! You people screwed that up too! Please put that back the way it was! REMEMBER FOLKS: \"IF IT ISN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!!!\"",
      "The messaging system is glitchy! I can't communicate with sellers as the send arrow only appears about 1/4 the time. It also has trouble loading the messages received so I can read them. Sometimes I have to click back out of the message and then back into it a few times before it decides to load.",
      "Not any better than the previous one, jumping all over the place when doing searches, you request to search by lowest price first and it still hides them between the higher priced items, so taking ages and time consuming to find things I want at affordable prices. I also hate the assumption in every search that there are things I do not want to see in each subject, I want to see all items available not have only the ones chosen by someone else who knows nothing about what I may be looking for?",
      "Needs work. I'm giving the eBay app three stars because basically it does what it should, although it does need quite a bit more tweaking to function better. Unfortunately the issues that I have experienced relate to the everyday functionality of it. It is very glitchy and does need seemingly constant babysitting to ensure that it is doing everything you want it to and that it is not just deciding to do certain things for you. Use with caution.",
      "Have given this app stick in the past, but to be fair it's always been true & trusted, & hasn't gone down that path that so many good apps have, Not overly keen on new look but it's fine, one thing(&I'm sure you hear this all the time,) Dark mode would take this all the way to 5..could it ever be a possibility in future (near) and a way to add a description to a saved sellers name, Otherwise its just a list of names with no reference"

      "I just noticed after I convinced myself to try the first 3 \"free\" days, if you dont cancel you'll get an automatic payment of $94.99 - for a full year subscription debited to your account. And with all thats going on im pretty sure getting a refund or in touch with any customer service will be in vain. Watch out!",
      "Horrible app. I feel sorry for people who believe in this stuff. It said I have poor health and that I need more cardio.... Had a yearly check up last week I'm in perfect health. I ride my bike everywhere, at least 40kms a day every day. It said I don't like my job and that I switch jobs often... I've had the same job for seven years and love it.. the only thing it got right was calling me a composer because I am. I did each test 3 times and got completely different results each time. Lmao scam",
      "After you installed this app, it'll require a monthly payment, unless you press free trial (which caught me by suprise), which I was pretty disappointed. Would make more sense if you pay first and then install the app like other apps do, or have it tell you in the description at least. Even though I gave this rating one star, my real rating would have been a half star (which wasn't a option). What a waste of time and space. So yeah, definitely DON'T install this app.",
      "This app is SUPER TRASH. It requires a monthly payment for a one time thing and you need to enter your credit card information for one time stuff. Also also... it's one of those apps which have a really annoying advertisement in game apps and stuff. Please don't download this app. I wasted my time on this so you don't have to.",
      "Poorly written explanations with many errors in typing and grammar. For a service that requires revolving payments it needs a lot of improvements. I was even unable to rate the app when the pop up, popped up. I had to back out of the page. Cancelling immediately, less than 10 minutes after installing."

      "This is my go to for writing any chapters for stories. Like it easily backs it all up so I don't have to worry about manually backing it up. It's very good with offline abilities too. Usually I have had apps crash or lag on me but this app did not do either. Quick on the go tools you can use as well as a few fonts. One small flaw and that is when I try to sometimes copy a specific section it won't let me. That has only happened to me a few time though.",
      "Great app, however when ever you switch to desktop the actual document's layout is different. The whole purpose of the app is to have it on the go and add pictures from your phone. There are no pages in the app so when you move to the desktop version the layout is different. It needs to have the desktop features like showing references and pages.",
      "Not a good app to use in android. There are a lot of cursor problems and when you click on the backspace button, the cursor moves to another line and starts deleting words. Has a lot of good templates, no doubt, but this app has to have some debugs for the problems faced by users using android.",
      "I'm using this app to write, it was great, easy to navigate through the app.. spellcheck is superior love the update, explore options while still app is a game changer, although, i wish there's night/ dark mode because i have trouble writing when the screen went to bright 🔆. overall, satisfying app",
      "Very convenient app, but a lot is missing or hard to access, such as font and spellcheck. It would be nice if you could double-tap or tap and hold a word to bring up the spellcheck instead of going into the menu each time, or if you could choose what formatting elements to have above your keyboard."

      "I love using this app. I love the fact that you can track multiple shipments (incoming and outgoing) from multiple carriers (USPS, FEDEX, UPS) in one spot simultaneously. Waiting for your package to arrive? Wonder when your package will be delivered? Want to see the shipping details? Arrive does all of this and more in one easy-to-use app. All you do is input your name and address, and it even shows packages being sent to you AUTOMATICALLY! This is the only package tracker I will ever use!!",
      "Does it's job well. Next step would be for the app to monitor the site where the receipt came from for a month incase if price drop for items purchased. This app would be a must have at that point. There are many different apps that does what this app does at this time though you could choose from but very few that does what I just suggested.",
      "I really like this app. It doesn't get every shipment, but if you have a Gmail account, then there's a great chance that any shipment info emailed to that address will show up in the app, shipments that you've sent and are receiving. Plus, I love that if necessary, it provides links to the carriers websites for more updated tracking information. I haven't had it track Amazon deliveries, but I do get tracking information from UPS, USPS, DHL, and FedEx.",
      "Very Informative!! This little app keeps me up to date on all packages being delivered to my home. The status and delivered updates are incomparable. There's only 1 thing that would make this little app phenomenal is if when the package is delivered, a photo of the package, and where it was left, is attached to the notification/confirmation.",
      "Very Disappointed. For as invasive as this app is, it offers very little in the way of functionality. It demands access to your email to automate shipping info and avoid typos in tracking numbers. No connection to the shipping vendor for custom delivery instructions. I have better results just using the links the vendor sends. Great concept, poor execution. I'll be uninstalling this app."

      "At first, it seemed like a really fun, cool app with tons of free features. Then it began having issues. Half the time, my settings won't load and my profile won't refresh. The microphone randomly cut off and never came back on even after an hour of waiting. They're constantly bombarding you to pay for a pro version. Why would I do that when the app seems like it's still in beta with all the constant errors? I'll likely be uninstalling.",
      "The app works great and at first I loved it. As it gets more difficult (which it should), the loss of hearts is irritating. Hearts are essentially the number of mistakes you are allowed. If you run out of hearts, you can't do anything with the app for hours. You can get more hearts with gems, but they run out too. The only way around this is to pay for the premium edition and poof..... the \"free\" app isn't free anymore.",
      "Feels like a video game. It was great after I figured out how to turn off sound effects. The speaking exercises are pretty buggy. The app always thinks I'm done talking if you pause for more than half a second. The app will say that I got it wrong because I failed to say the rest of the words. I was getting to them! Can I breathe for half a second between words? I want to learn how to speak by sounding out the words slowly, but Duolingo won't let me do that :-(",
      "There are plethora of languages to learn and the approach is natural, progress is easy. However, a few cons : not enough audio of sentences, and most are of poor quality. Example in Vietnamese when the woman speaks, sound is terrible. It would be better if on the tablet the text blocks were bigger. Also, the new heart system makes the app really useless for too long. It was better before. Those who cannot afford to pay will just end up losing interest.",
      "Great app! I would love it if they would add a course for English speakers to learn Thai though. Also, once you complete a language it would be cool if you could re-activate the checkpoints so you could keep raising your levels, but without having to do each lesson individually. Finally, I would love to have the Groups/Clubs feature brought back. The social aspect of the app is really lacking. Overall though, it is my favorite language app so far."

The apps user interface for setup is extremely easy. It pretty much does everything for you. After that though, I found navigation within the app somewhat convoluted.",

Had to connect to a new wifi network and keeps telling me its all set up and connected but the device can not be found now. I can not cast anything to my google chromecast.

      "It gives me a big message about Coronavirus when I open the app, but it disappears before I can read it. It would be nice if the \"Restricted Items in Cart\" error message actually said which item(s) it had a problem with. \"You have one or more restricted items in your cart. Restricted items can only be purchased at a register. Please remove them if you would like to checkout using Scan & Go\" is a completely useless error message.",
      "It is an exceptional tool, and another reason to rate Sam's above other \"big box\" stores! They also have an associate wipe down the carriages before you take one. They are doing everything they can to make sure your experience during these trying times are safe! So if you use, \"Scan and Go,\" you are maximizing social distancing, and minimizing the danger of exposure.",
      "This app is great and convenient for Scan and Go features as well as for looking as items online. The only problem I have is that when I order items to be shipped, the app omits my apartment number from the delivery information when I use my saved home address (which includes the apartment number). This causes issues with getting deliveries and some items have been sent back to the warehouse. Please fix this so I can place orders more seamlessly!",
      "The app was working well before today, 5 stars. But when I used today, the app caused the phone to shutdown ( screen went black and the phone was unresponsive) with every item scan. Lines were long, so I continued restarting the phone after each item scan and could finish the checkout process. Hope they fix the instability issues.",
      "This is probably the worst app that has ever been created. The scanner works, but you can't check out. It keeps asking for the credit card CVV number, which is accurate for both cards I use with this account. Absolute trash. Update 3/5/2020 Apparently they got the message. App has been working flawlessly for past 6 months. Changed from 1 star to 5 stars."

      "First day with this app and I just love it. Reference back to the Bible helps better understand the scriptures and the language (English) makes it perfect to follow/understand. My previous app was also KJV but this version is a great update for me. Thank you. God bless us all",
      "Love my Bible App all day anytime anywhere it just a fingertip away, the thing is has a Christian sometimes life becomes fast going in the day time, sometimes can't keep track of what time it is but between hours you get notifications that it's time to pray, it doesn't matter where you are you can pray,Thank you Jesus for this app",
      "First I love reading the.verse for that day and then how they expain what that is saying by sometimes examples and storytelling. It can be an eye opener to something you thought you knew or you didn't know. Last of all the prayer. What can be said about prayer? Prayer is communicating with you talking to God while He listens and God talking back to you while you listens to God. The prayer is inline to what the subject of that day is and it help strenghten and encourages us not to give up.",
      "I love this app iit has diffrent versions of the Bible. I would recommend this for people who have a hard time understanding the King James version. They have different versions of the scriptures to help you better understand them.",
      "I Love the app. It is a beautiful app that helps me. Stay close to me religion. But this just came to my feed( popup ads) ok, i do understand that u need ads to help run this app. That is not a problem for me.

      "\"We're having some trouble getting reddit\". Uninstalled - Reinstalled multiple times just to get the same error message. The ap crashed after a few minutes of using and fails to refresh on the latest content. Reported the bug and they advised me to do what I already have been doing (as I told them without success). It is definitely something to do on their end, I give up trying to deal with it. 1 star until fixed.",
      "I have been using Reddit a lot these past few months but boy, I don't even begin to cut it when I say this app sucks. It creates on me atleast 10 times a day which is so goddamn frustrating. After the new update, I have only seen issues pile up. The images and videos don't load. If the videos do load, they're more pixelated than mario. The audio also has its own issues from time to time. Also, the numbers for notifications refuse to go away even after I read them.",
      "It's a decent app overall which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of less. The issue is that when I try to post a comment, it says I'm doing it too much and to wait 4-7 minutes before trying again. I wait for over an hour and it gives me the same message. So now I have to wait 100 days to get the karma required to post stuff because I can only comment or reply once a day. And that's if I get an upvote everyday. Ridiculous, please get it fixed.",
      "Comments take forever to load, or just flat out won't load. The feed will just stop and not load the next post. The feed will also be old, nont updated with newer posts. It doesn't matter if I have a strong or week signal, wifi or data. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but issues persist. Just stick to the web page."

      "Don't bother with this useless app.The app hasn't worked right since february of this year, 2020. It constantly loops to sign in, sign up. You can sign up and it loops again. I've reported it via support more than once, nothing changes. Bugs are never fixed. The managers say \"we can't do anything about it. Our customers are very upset, but we have no way to report the problem.\" Other fast food apps seem to work. What's wrong with Burger King?",
      "When I first started using this it was great. You can pay through it and not have to deal with cash. Very discounted Impossible Burgers and other deals so you don't have to carry BK coupons around. Now almost every time I open it it says Downloading Update and the update often fails. Last time I placed an order it got glitchy and said try later, so I retried and ended up getting double billed. Please simplify the app that used to work fine. Galaxy Tab A 2019 Android 9.",
      "Overall, the apps is great. The deals are worthwhile and change enough to keep coming back. My only complaints are that sauce and drink choices are incomplete as well as when ordering a deal that contains two sandwiches, the modifications to the second sandwich are not given to the staff making our food. This has happened to me every time and I have verified the modifications in my order history.",
      "Can't log in on the app. There is no option to put in username and password. It sends an email with a link to click to log in. That works great for the web app but if you click the link to open the app. Nothing. Who tries to run a script on a web page to open an app on your phone? Poor design. Just order on the web.",
      "I like the deals but the functionality is lacking. The previous app, for its failings, was at least consistent. Now I get the notice that my connection has issues, so it won't load the cart. Been this way over a week. I also miss the \"I'm here\" function that would make sure you weren't charged until you could pick up your food, and your food would be fresh. My Burger King is horribly slow, so it's nice to give them some lead time"

I even cleared my cache partion on my phone. Thought maybe something internally was getting hung up. So none of them fixed the problem.",
      "Worked fine until update a few days ago. Now will not close with back button. Uninstalled. Reinstalled. Rebooted. Cleared cache. Cleared data. Still same problem. Apparently you aren't allowed to turn it off anymore. Update: CNN fixed the problem. Pretty efficient. Back to 4.5 stars. Thanks guys",
      "This app is terrible. Not the content, that's another rant. I'm saying the app is clunky and poorly made. I get 3 updates a day for opinion pieces but I miss breaking news. For some reason they cant use closed captioning so the disabled and elderly (because so many of the audience is under 20) dont get anything out of it. When casting the video quality becomes pixilated and audio lags (makes trying to lip read without captioning even harder). 3 months later no captions #CNNhatesthedisabled",
      "This app is awesome! It works far better than any other news app I've tried. Enjoy articles, videos, or CNN Live TV! They even give you the option to hear the iconic, \"This is CNN-\" when opening the app. Definitely worth the download. 5 stars, no less. Give it a try.",
      "I like CNN and their news, but not this app. I disabled video auto play but the articles still play video as you scroll through the feed, very distracting and a waste of data. Installing until you fix the settings. And half the time I open it, it's just a big white page \"unknown error\"."

      "I have been using google voice for a few years now without ANY problems but all of a sudden it stopped working. I cant make/receive calls nor send/receive text messages. I have uninstalled three times in an effort to fix the problem but it's still not working. This is causing a huge disruption for me and there seems to be no technical support.",
      "Usually great, but since the latest update, the notification on my lock screen (and thus also when I unlock) keeps disappearing. It'll show up for a few minutes, but if I don't get to it fast enough or if I don't see it right away, it just goes away. I keep needing to go into the app to make sure I haven't missed texts.",
      "I really appreciate being able to have a second number that I can keep permanently for keeping my personal phone personal. I don't want everyone calling my cellphone; close friends, family etc yes! Business contacts, retail memberships, creditors, not at all. Nothing sucks more when trying to relax than some a-hole blowing up your phone. Got to love Google for this service! @ pthis price this service cannot be beat. Thanks Google Team!! Sincerely, Moe",
      "Cant give it a 5... works great so far, definitely notifies me when I missed a call and it went to voicemail, but I want to either extend the number of \"rings\" before it goes to voicemail, OR disable the voicemail feature and review my missed calls! Either option would be good, and allow me the time to get to the phone to answer it! I am not so young that it is attached to my hand, and it seems to go to voicemail very quickly. Please advise on either option that I would like to utilize!",
      "I've been using Google voice for a while now. I really enjoy having one phone number for everything. I'm not sure if I'm imagining this but it seems like I don't get very many spam calls to my number which is super nice. The search leaves something to be desired and the chrome plugin no longer works."

I've been using this app for years now, since the release of the said app, I experienced an awesome quality and the best loading but now with the latest update is bad. The videos I'm playing with the same posters are crashing and replayed in the second video. It's bad!!! I'll give a five star again if you fix this.. 😤😤😤😤",
      "Some notes when am using this app : sometimes lagging and not stable, when i watching videos some contents they popped up to me and they hadn't any relation between a content that i had been watching it. Please fix the resolution when i install it on some devices that are with fully screen i can see empty area below the screen ( that's important). ...sometimes when i try to save images, it pops up a message he says ' you can not download' even the network available and everything going cool.",
      "I just installed the new update, and now Facebook won't open. The Facebook Lite logo appears on a white screen with blue dots. However the screen appears frozen, the row of blue dots remain still with only the first dot light up. This did not happen until I updated the app. Help!!!!!",
      "Facebook lite becomes a boring one because of it's service...I have update my facebbok lite to have better feature...But,after update it slow down my phone and create a lot of case data...beside,it becomes hard to see a video perfectly...So,wish you will solve this problem and help me and other stay happy with you...",
      "1. Feeds were refreshed automatically even when I still reading a post. 2. There is a white bezel at the bottom of the screen although I have turned on fullscreen mode. 3. Cannot open any link on notification after the latest update. 4. Cannot open suggested videos, previous same video will be played even though I select others."

      "Mostly works better than Skype or any other video chat app I've used in terms of video and audio quality/stability. But for some reason, my video was really dark. It doesn't look that way when using the Google camera app on my phone. So I guess this app must have some sort of proprietary camera app built into it that doesn't have the ability to auto-adjust the exposure based on how brightly lit the subject is. BTW, I'm using a Pixel 2 running stock 8.1 Android OS.",
      "The UI is clunky and unintuitive. Chat is hidden behind 2-3 taps depending on how you access it. Picture-in-picture doesn't work correctly. It's either way too big, or compressed and the buttons don't work. It switches off. The video quality is pretty good though, as is the tooling. MS Teams is far better though.",
      "We started using the app with my teachers and classmates about 3d ago, due to COVID19, school's shut down & it's still unknown whether we'll attend physically. The only problem I've met so far is the audio being cut here and there occasionally• the app says \"low network quality\", although I'm sitting next to the router & my carrier network is 4G at all times. In overall, it's an easy app to use & understandable by its audience. I really like it & hope the minor bugs will be fixed soon.",
      "I absolutely love this product. The recent support of the current situation in the world and availability of this tool for free. Priceless. I have given my sister's school district that's severely underfunded and did not have a continuity plan or the tools to resume business. To collaborate between 7 remote rural locations on any platform or mobile device available. Being able to gather collectively, share information and visualize the path forward. Thank you is inadequate for the gratitude.",
      "It's the best or the most convenient but perhaps helps in getting the work done. I would like to add a point specially for developers is that there are certain issues in connecting or joining the call however once joined it works usually fine. So what I would say here is improve the ways of joining. 1. It doesn't work when we put name i.e. abc.xyz like in case of desktop version which also shows last joined WebEx helps in easily connecting. 2. Not all calls are synchronized with outlook."

      "They are slowly killing this app. It used to work well, but functionality has been dying and I'm guessing it's a bit on purpose given that they have been trying to make other kinds of messaging apps. First, custom ringtones went away, now, there is no notification ringtone at all, just vibrate. It's sad as the functionality with desktop Gmail and the Google voice numbers just used to be great. There's less and less reason to use this.",
      "The app works fine and is a great way for me to contact and call my friends. The only problem is that I don't know how to change the ringtone. At first the notifications only came in as vibrations. Then I changed the notification sound back to normal, but the ringtone would be the notification sound looped. Could someone help me figure out how to change the ringtone back to normal? Thank you.",
      "I love this app for it's multi functionality, great all in one messaging app. It is too bad Google is not investing enough in Hangouts. Instead they went for some weird multiple single task apps like that Allo bs app none one is using anyways. Duo is not bad for video calls, but again the problem is that every one you want to contact and chat with must have all these messaging apps installed on there phones. And why the hell did they remove location sharing?",
      "Just not the same. It wouldn't make the noise anymore when I got a text. I'd be missing texts, and texts not sending. Did an update on my phone which updated the app, and now the names of my contacts aren't associated with their phone numbers. I have group texts and i don't even know who's sending what text because it shows the number instead of the contact. Wish I didn't update it now. Would like to know who's sending me texts, not the number.",
      "The latest update reset the ringtone from 'Hangouts Message' to 'App provided'. To restore 'Hangouts Message', go into Settings > [your account] > Notifications Messages > Advanced > Sound. Then use Media Storage to choose 'Hangouts Message' (or any other ringtone you want). NOTE: 'Settings' refers to settings within the Hangouts app, not the system settings."

      "The mobile version of this app is frustrating. It's great when it decides to work but 95% of the time, the app wont load, when it does load and play a video, it is constantly freezing. It also will freeze and then skip back by itself and replay audio that has past and then start playing again just to freeze again. Can we please have someone look into this and actually fix it????!!!",
      "I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. The episodes. Don't play without glitches, if they play at all. One minute I can watch on my TV, the next I can't. Then there's the mobile app, which is a total loss. But what is REALLY effing annoying and weird, is that an episode is English dubbed one second, and Japanese subbed the next. And it happens, WHILE YOU'RE watching!!! I appreciate funimarion for providing fans with dub options, but the app is a disaster. And the website is even worse.",
      "App needs work. Clicking on things like \"recently add\" takes you to list that keeps refreshing when you get to the end. What looks like 100s of shows is really just the same 15 shows repeated again and again. Click on a show and going back takes you all the way to the top of the list. There is also video playback issues... forever to load, pause and can't continue. Want to go back or skip forward a few seconds, nope, video stops working. Overall just a poor UI. Also needs a night mode.",
      "This is my second review. I noticed you respond regularly to these however instead of \"talk to customer support\", \"sorry you're having a bad time.\" and shrugging off doing something about it put some effort into fixing the app or just take it down. You have all the clear consistent information you need to figure it out: laggy, freezes, slow, bad resolution ect. It's not us it's you and we would dearly love for you to fix it so we can actually enjoy the content you provide.",
      "I have this app on my phone, it's really awesome. I love it, but it won't let me subscribe even on the website, and I would like to. Sometimes when I go to a different page it's just blank, and I have to start all over. Not all the episodes of some anime are in English and I'm not really into reading subtitles so I have started some and don't finish. Other than that I deal with it and will continue watching, and trying to subscribe."

      "Amazing App, it goes beyond just telling you what your balance is, it breaks down what you've spent abd where. As well as tells what the recommended weekly budget should be to make your balance last all month. Plus it helps you find work, and provides links to company's that offer you discounts if you are an EBT recipient. Awesome, just awesome! 🤙💯🙌",
      "So I guess it's happening to other ppl also, but I cannot log in to see my balance! Everytime I try it says invalid info! So finally I tried to make a new account, enter new information and it still tells me something is invalid!!! This is so frustrating. I have had this app for a couple years and never had any problems, until now! I have also tried calling to talk to a live person about the problem but can't get ahold of anyone at the#. Please fix this problem! Until recently this app was great",
      "Awesome app!! Been using it for a while now. No more calling the EBT line for balance. Easy, helpful, & informative. Not only does it give your balance, but it helps with teaching you how to stretch your funds to last the whole month. It even lists job openings & other programs for assistant!!",
      "Aside from the quick convenience of accessing your EBT balance and info, this app has a ton of helpful tips and options for people on a tight budget. You can \"clip\" hundreds of coupons from your local grocery store, learn how to get Amazon Prime for 50% off just for having EBT benefits, plus you can access many options for improving job skills (for free), fixing your resume, finding jobs with flexible hours, and more. This app is the cat's pajamas! Glad I found it.",
      "EXCELLENT. JUST EXCELLENT! I love this app to the tenth power. Thank you to the creators of Fresh EBT - Food Stamp App. No more calling the number on the back of the card when you have something left to spend but forgot how much it is. Love it, love it, love it!"

      "Decent, not excellent, when it works. Utterly useless when it doesn't. Whether or not this app will sync is a bit of a coin toss. Particularly frustrating when it syncs parts of a conversation, leading to confusing replies. When it does work, it's useful but not great. The notifications for example are not clickable. In its present state I will not be keeping it. It feels like something that would be in late alpha/early beta stages. I wonder why Microsoft would allow something like this.",
      "I couldn't change my selected email on my pc from an old school email I had once used, even after removing the account i was prompted to sign back into the same one. The trouble shooting did not help me at all, and for some, reason it will continue to say that my phone has been linked, even when not properly linked. I would remove it to try and add it again, only to see that my device was never properly removed in the first place, as not even that function seems to work. Please fix this!!!!!!!",
      "Very nice App I love it. But there is one small issue. Sometimes it doesn't stays connected in order to synchronize so you have to start the app manually. But that's okay. Another thing which really bad is the missing support for other than standard calls. For example WhatsApp calls aren't supported. That's not good because in many regions the isn't a good cellular connection for VoLTE and the call quality of normal calls is really bad. I would love to see support for WhatsApp calls.",
      "This is an excellent app I am now using the app to write this. This app is very usefull to access the phone with my computer. I can easily use this app to interact with my laptop programs which in the past will not be easy to do. I can also access my phone w/o looking into the phone while I am working. Also this app allows me to use a physical keyboard w/o the need to link a keyboard to my phone. Excellent app.",
      "I left my phone in my locker at work. Battery around 80%. I come back a few hours later to find my phone is at 11%, and this app was the primary culprit. This app also consumed a TON of my data. Why? My computer wasn't even on at home! This app provides a valuable service but is not worth those pain points."

Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (TFA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (TFA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (TFA) on all your accounts. Then, when you sign in, you’ll provide your username and password as usual. Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

      "The reason I prefer this app over the big G's one is that this one has cloud backup. If you've had issues with Google losing your info due to server issues or, more commonly, lost/stolen/broken/new phones, you'll know how invaluable it is that Microsoft allows your credentials to be backed up so you're not locked out of everything. I had this as a one-star review because of a security flaw that was fixed REALLY fast by Microsoft. That is great and another reason to recommend this app (Google had the same flaw, no idea on if theirs is fixed, but to anyone using their authenticator, you REALLY should make sure it's been patched). Overall, straight up usability of the few authenticators I've tried, I really do prefer this one quite a lot over the others. It does what it should. It's quickly patched in case of security flaws. Super recommended.",
      "Works very well as a two-factor on logins, the notifications pop up automatically and require you to pick from three different two digit numbers, matching what prompted you on the login attempt. Works too prevent click jacking attacks in addition to SIM spoofing and still allows two factor.",
      "When I got a new ISP Microsoft did not recognize the new IP address on my pc and asked me to log in. To do so it required verification from this app. Since this app is not used on a regular basis when i opened this app it asked me to re-login, which i could not do since the useless app asked me to verify my identity, by using a verification code from the \" microsoft authenticator app\" Utterly pointless",
      "Very best app for authenticator , but : 1. Theme : - work on modern style with animations . - dark theme - add more icons ( mega.nz , ifttt , and ...) 2. Ability : Add \"sort by \" Fix please : When i turn on backup cods , my new cods dont save in server . CREATE WEB VERSION OR PC VERTION . Thanks .",
      "Issues with Samsung S10E... actually the home button of the samsung cellphone itself is not working as the Authenticator app is blocking it... please fix this asap as this is really annoying. It says: \"Security Policy prevents use of Home key\" Obviously I use this device as Company mobile."

      "Connection to VPN disconnects every few minutes requiring user to relaunch the app to re-establish the connection. Very annoying when you want to continue browsing knowing the VPN will remain connected. To the best of my knowledge I have instructed my phone not to restrict the app and allow it to auto start. I have also enabled 'connect automatically' within the app itself. App also doesn't launch immediately, instead you have to look at s picture of a lighthouse?",
      "I will revise this review after I have had time to use it more and evaluate all aspects of it, but I strongly recommend using Norton antivirus and Norton Secure VPN, as well as most Norton products in general because it's been a solid, tried and true company for at least 40 years, (or as long as I've been alive.)",
      "Great for security I had the same issue others had on the trial broke down an paid for the subscription and it works totally opposite of the trial The security for transactions is completely different very secure I do not have every thing I look up follow me advertisers are not able to follow me. If you bank or use a trading platform or purchases you will see the difference. I was very skeptical. Glad I made the purchase and was able to buy a lifetime purchase norton AV for 5 devices with VPN.",
      "Update: 3/14/2020 - now no longer works at all, not able to \"set up Norton account\" can't even get into the program. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. Norton Mobile Security seems to work just fine...but this VPN app flat out doesn't work. I answer to developer comment, same problem either over my home wifi or cellular. Doesn't matter. Takes a LONG time to connect. Many times it NEVER connects. When it works, it seems to work well though...just very hit and miss.",
      "What a ridiculous and useless app. Unstable, and wouldn't connect. I assumed it was because I was using a limited version during the free trial. So then I went to cancel, which was insanely difficult and wound up being charged for something I can't use. Tryi g to request a refund from my phone on the mobile website put me into an endless loop of new tabs being opened, without ever being able to request my refund. This comes off like a scam, which is a shame considering the Norton reputation."

I lole how you can also move it around your picture screen like its a sticker lr something. I think a color wheel instead of clicking to change would make the app better though. 5/5 star!!!!!!",
      "sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When I click on the YOLO link from someone else's sc story, it usually brings me to this app and when I click \"open\" on the menu here, it doesn't bring me to the place where I send other people messages. I would rate it lower but this is the only problem it has so far.",

Nothing else happens. I reallt dont understand why this is happening... i wish it worked cuz i do love this app a lot 😕 please fix it. Is it because my phone is an android btw? (If so... i still dont get it lol cuz my tablet is also android...)",

Immediately brings you to the google play store page for this app. Once you click 'open', nothing happens and the usual page where you can respond to your friend's yolo questions never comes up. Many people have had this problem for a while and I havent seen them provide a solution.",
      "Someone else is linking this in the story to ask questions, I slide up, and all it does is bring me to the play store where the app is already installed. Opening the app manually does nothing. It does not work properly on the new Note. I've reinstalled, cleared cache, everything. Zero functionality when trying to ask someone else questions. Simply doesn't work, and this phone is new."

      "Worst app ever you will be lucky to receive anything you purchase. When installed it permits itself to control and make changes to every single function on your device it can even control your wifi, scary eh! It gets worse, when you figure it out and disable all these self appointed permissions the device requires a security update a day or so later and everything goes back to the way it was. You are given the option to disable cookies but you can't actually do it .DO NOT INSTALL",
      "I really enjoyed use this app, I being used for almost 4 yrs now, and I really like the price the items and the enormously variation of items. Most everything arrives between 1to 3 months ( 3months was the maximum that I have to wait for a T-shirt one time), and I never get any troubles using my debit card, and they customer service is amazing, never fall me when I need a refund or exchange ect.",
      "I love this app! I think it is wonderful and so much better than wish! This app is fantastic and I shop on it almost constantly! I do wish that they would watch their products a little bit more, just to make sure that no one's ripping people off. I have seen one or two products that were not as the description!! but they are getting really good aboit catching thay stuff!!",
      "Not intuitive and nor easy to use. Need to go hunt around as some function/features not in obvious location. Re-evaluate: Still not intuitive to navigate. Had to sign in whenever I need to confirm delivery. Then had to look high and low for the pages. There are other online site that is very easy to use which I patronise more than this site.",
      "You site is cool but don't like it when you keep suggesting that you know what I am looking for. If I search for an item but the App keeps suggesting that I like other kind of products and every time I open the App the same previous items appear as if I were to keep loving them. I hate that and sometimes feel angry and uninstall the App and will Install it again the next time I wanna shop. I know that's what you think is that people love the same kind of things they search for in the engine"

      "Scan via phone's cam is a great feature and works very well, using a smart algorithm to aligning the angle so that the page does not need to be perfectly aligned. Scan via printer is not letting you change document sizes when using document feeder, only if in glass. Also, adding and reordering documents to a scan is not possible (anymore?). Would be very useful to address these two features in nearby updates. Communication between phone and printer is otherwise without complains.",
      "This app is not user friendly at all. Scanning is slow and trying to save a scanned document to my Google Drive is not possible on my Chrome Book. When I firs installed my HP printer, it was very difficult even hough I followed he directions precisely. Also, I am very disappointed that I have to \"manually\" print double-sided, and when I ask it to print 2 copies, it'll only print one copy. I don't know if the problem is with the app or the model of the HP printer I have.",
      "I have a new HP computer and bought a NEW HP OfficeJet 5258. I installed the HP Smart and connected it to my computer. The app just sits and 'spins', doesn't save or print. I literally am so frustrated with it I may take the printer back. I would think that since both computer and printer are HP, things would work seamlessly. But this seems to not be the case.",
      "Finally got it set up and connected. Printed the test page just fine, but when I tried to print from my Moto G 5 Plus it cancelled. All it says is \"cancelling\" on my phone but it isn't cancelling or printing. I can't even cancel it because it says it's cancelling. Can't delete it or do anything. I've turned the printer off and unplugged it but it still won't cancel. POS so far. I'm glad I didn't buy any spare cartridges.",
      "I have had different HP Printers with Instant Ink and they have all worked perfectly for me. I like how I can send an email directly to my printers email to print. Even if you are not at home, you can still print anything you need. I signed up for the fax service but I have not used it yet. There are different plans for the instant ink you can change to. 500 sheets of paper for $5 thru Amazon from HP is a great deal. I have been using HP Printers for years and I will never betray HP Thanks HP!"

      "Quality cannot be beat. Does not have all albums I want so unfortunately I cannot use it as a replacement for CDs. It would be nice to be able to create a station off of your playlist. That would allow you to put all your favorite songs into a playlist, and then discover new music that extrapolates off of your playlist. Also, it would be better if you could select all your favorite albums and have it under a Tab for \"my albums.\" You cannot simply browse a catalog of all of your favorite albums",
      "Unintuitive and slow as molasses. Freezes and crashes regularly. When using it to control music on my Echo or Echo Studio, it's a constant stream of errors. Safe to say I won't continue using Amazon music after my trial is up. Amazon has so much strength in software development that it's astounding to me that they could have such a buggy app for something as simple as music streaming.",
      "I don't quite get how to do the playlists. It doesn't give me options to add to my lists or how to do it plus it's false advertising when you say free, even for 30 days, and then charge. And finally, I want to hear what I want and not what Alexa wants or finds on Amazon. I'm a big fan and loyal customer of Amazon but, for me, this falls way short of expectations.",
      "They only want you to use it online. Recent update removed the ability to search my own offline music. Supposedly can filter the search after it's performed but miraculously there are never any results found. Plus I'm so sick and tired of the \"free trial\" spam every time I open the app. My songs are on my SD card, not in the cloud.",
      "Sound quality is excellent. However the android user interface needs a lot of work. Albums are displayed by popularity and there's no way to sort this by using a filter to display by album date, date added etc. Same thing with playlists, a filter is needed. I guess it's still early days and hopefully these issues will be fixed soon. I migrated across from Spotify due to the lack of high res streaming options and the library cap of 10k songs compared to 100k on Amazon Music."

      "It's really easy to install this app and then join the meeting on my phone. The controls go into the pull down menu on my phone , so it's easy to mute and unmute. The screen sharing is very good and the transmission is very clear.",
      "One thing about my experience was that the video feed kept shifting from person to person, in a random, unorganized way. Plus, the more people that talk on the video conference, the harder it is to hear any sound at all. at least that is the way it is with phones, but I do not know how this app works on computers. Finally, this app could include functions that allow pictures and videos to be shown, in an organized way.",
      "I am experiencing problems in connecting my wireless headset to my windows laptop. This is not the problem of the headset connectivity issue with the laptop, it works fine. The problem only occurs with \"Go-to meeting\" application in Windows desktop version. The audio is not audible. I hope your team will address this soon.",
      "Very positive alternative to face to face..during coronavirus time..first time user of web meet type conference call..7.5 out of 10....I found difficulty toggling between my phone audio and camera visual but maybe as first time and had phone on initially then computer...maybe the graphics for boggling etc could be made clearer etc but overall good..able to use without downloading in my laptop which was a bonus...surprised how good it was....",
      "Anyone know how to get tiles of all callers on android? It keeps flipping back and forth to each individual caller. Very difficult to deal with. Makes be dizzy. Works fine for iPhone and iPad attendees and works on my PC, but bad experience on my Samsung android. Any suggestions?"

      "This app used to be the best when it came to mobile editing. But i have no idea what the hell is wrong with this app from a certain time. The new update is surely a big mess. I am unable to edit a single photo, apply a single effect. Every time after choosing a picture to edit, it just restarts again and again. Fix this guys, and make this app great again !!",
      "I used to love this app so so much and it still is amazing. I just personally don't need a lot of these new tools introduced last year. If you want to go wild and creative then sure they are pretty exciting! I just don't need them and still am restricted by them and the need to pay. I wanted to save a project I was working on and couldn't unless I paid a subscription. Great app, just be aware of the penetrating demand for you to subscribe. (Still, love it lots, thank you!)",
      "I've had this app for a while now and it was working great. I loved the options I had, but recently this app has gotten so bad. Whenever I go to edit it glitches out after EVERY click I make. It's so annoying/frustrating that I'm almost done with this app. This bugging out constantly has pushed my patience to it's limit and if it doesn't get fixed soon I'm uninstalling. I've updated it and it hasn't fixed anything. Please fix this because it's an overall good app that I want to keep using.",
      "No free part, EXPEN$$$IVE paid. Actually, no, it's not a free app. I tried to add text and save my picture, but there was no save option, only a 3 day free trial that requires me to sign up, probably give credit card information, spend 10 minutes to save a picture. So, no free part, just use the free Photoshop app or VSCO, or anything. The paid app costs too much, and there is no free app.",
      "Great, even for a novice like me. One request: an ability to create a clickable link, preferably via a graphic image added to the picture. I usually put a small image of my social media accounts. It'd be great if the viewer could just click on the link to get to one of my accounts, especially if the picture has been copied and shared through other people's accounts."

      "This app sucks. It doesnt load properlly. They charge $20 to promote your items, every body asks for what your selling at a dirt cheap price. When ever somebody says they want to purchase some thing at a resonable price, the messages disappear when you log in. By the time an item sells, your practically having to give your item away. Probably the apps algorithm. It's done the same thing twice.",
      "Update: app sucks. When not let me in and keeps giving me an error code. So tired of this inconsistency and being locked out. SNAP!! it locks you out of your messages and then asks you to register as if you don't have an account. I've only been using this for about six months and it's already happened three times. Can't reply to people's messages. Missed sales. very frustrating. Not sure why they aren't fixing this problem because according to other people it's been going on a long time",
      "No support on bugs at all. I do not get audio notifications for items I'm selling. example: a person messages me wanting to buy an item, I see it FOUR HOURS later. response .metrics/times are way up to an hour because of this bug. could have lost the sale and look like a clown for not responding when OFFERUP NEVER NOTIFIED ME. What's up guys? This sucks. Update: There literally is NO support. Just random comments trying to look like they are actively doing something. they definitely aren't",
      "The app works well for the most part and does have some consistently great deals. After their last update I had to reinstall the app in order to do a new post, which has me a bit concerned on their regression testing process. Just an annoyance, I would still recommend folks trying it out.",
      "Seems like it could have been a good marketplace with good deals but you can't actually buy anything. Sellers just never respond to even full price offers or worse accept then cancel the sale. Days or even weeks wasted. Unreliable or inactive sellers/listings need to be removed. Too frustrating as is, uninstalled."

      "Shopper here. This has been an enjoyable experience so far. My only nit-picky issue with this app is that it has no contogencie plan for when things don't go perfectly smooth (which 99% of the time nothing goes wrong). Only once was an Advantage card for a customer not accepted and had to be rescanned. I couldn't get the card to be presented again. Everything else has been A+",
      "I'm a new shopper, done a few shopping runs, however each run has major app connectivity problems!! Extremely frustrating when I'm at the store & I can't access the shopping list & none of the suggested solutions work. I even called support but was disconnected after 10 minutes on hold (30 minutes after arriving at the store). I have high speed internet on my phone & great cell reception. Please fix the problems!!!!! Also ought to pay shoppers for the time wasted when app is glitching!",
      "I was happy about the promise of orders automatically being removed from my dashboard. That is until I got stuck in a horrible nightmare of having an error I guess where that didn't happen. The app said to call my customer and to contact instacart care. I am currently on attempt number 4 to contact instacart. It has been over 3 hours so far. The chat system is completely useless. I have had 2 separate calls today disconnect before I got help.",
      "For the most part I like the app but I was having issues at checkout when the cards kept getting declines. I restart the app and I had already checked for updates and there was none. Very irritating doing double batches and can't checkout. Customers even added new cards still declined. Please look into features.",
      "I love the shopper app! Works so smoothly the only problem at aldi half the items do not scan and you have to force scan even thou its the correct item but I never have problems at cvs. Also the layout of the app on how to shop is wrong for aldi its not faster going by how they recommend you shoo because each store is layed out differently but other then that it works great abd with my gps. It does not drain my battery at all my mother has that problem thou but I dont overall very pleased"

      "I've used this app for my music listening needs, but it's annoying to enjoy music for free whenever you get bombarded by two 30 second ads in the span of maybe 2 songs. Honestly, if you want to use this app, get ready to cough up money for a subscription or else I hope you're patient enough to sit through annoying ads. Also, occasionally when adjusting the queue, the tracks don't properly move and go to the wrong spot or original spot.",
      "So I've been using this music app for a couple of years. Except I've had the Go+ for only about a year. It's pretty good and all but I don't understand why your location matters. There are so many songs that I can't listen to because it says that the song is not available in my country, which seems unnecessary to me. I also dislike that many popular and big artists don't even have their songs on soundcloud and there's no way to listen to their music. Mostly everything else is alright.",
      "It's ok. You can't delete or block \"followers\" or spam so that's stupid. When I search for a band, I want only that band and all their songs. 4 star still but since I got hit with an autorenewal I didn't want, 1 star. There's also no way to dislike a long so it won't play anymore. Google music is much better",
      "So I give it a 3 because the app is good, but on phone SoundCloud you can't upload no songs you can't edit your profile you can't do nothing on mobile SoundCloud other than buy Try Go+ and listen to music. This app will be godly if they'll let you do stuff that pc people do. Now I gotta go on my pc or go to chrome on my phone and go to desktop mode to upload music smh🤦🏾‍♂️ And another thing. Bugs. The bugs are horrendous! Plz fix and update and this app will be 10/10.",
      "I've been using using SoundCloud for 10+ years and have been the jukebox for my family friends and co-workers since then 😇 Top music, plays in the background, minimal data usage, best playlists, stations tuned to your taste almost always guaranteed to add at least one choice song to your library a day. I have 1250 liked in the last 10 years. SoundCloud will forever be the best source of music to me. God bless you all in Jesus Christ name and may peace be with you. 🙏😇❤️❤️❤️"

      "Prices displayed are deceiving/misrepresented of \"actual price\" . For example: when shopping bed frames, when you select the size of bed frame (like a king) then select the color, it will show you the price of the full (but doesn't indicate this anywhere on the screen. I had to call customer service who snottingly advised me of this and offered no apologies). Then when you select the color, on the main screen it will show the \"actual price\".",
      "This app used to work fantastic. Unfortunately after multiple updates it has become nothing more than wasted space on my mobile device. As many other people have mentioned 95% of the time it will not load any searches. Will not allow to scroll photos but only enlarges the initial photo as well. I have had some great experiences with Wayfair but this app has forced me on many occasions in the last few weeks to make my purchases elsewhere. I have deleted/ redownloaded as well as much more.",
      "It's easy to navigate, love the stuff they have but for some reason now, when I click on a product it doesn't show at the bottom similar products anymore. Idk if it's just my phone but point is, I don't like that. I like seeing similar options as it makes it easier to find things I like so I've not been using it much cus of that.",
      "Not sure what happened to this app but I can no longer view any of the color selections. No matter what option I select the photo doesn't change. Please fix this. Buying online from stock photos is already a gamble but not being to preview a color sample is just bad. I've used this app many times and have had no other issues until recently with this problem.",
      "Very cumbersome and slow to use in all aspects: searching for items, filtering items, accessing orders, viewing the cart, etc. The only thing that happens quickly is placing an order. However, it happens so quickly that you don't get to review items or delivery options."
