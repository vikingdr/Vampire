      "I highly suggest you get the pro version. It is so much better than the ad version. The only time the scanner ever goes down is when the person providing the feed disconnects. It works flawlessly otherwise. I was a beta tester on the other version and decided to get the pro and am very glad I did.",
      "This app adds so much convenience and extra features as opposed to going directly to the Broadcastify website. To me, the differences between the free and Pro version were negligible; but I enjoyed the free version so much that I bought the Pro just to support the developer.",

This app has suddenly become the best thing on my phone. I was able to use it to record footage for a live stream and it looked absolutely amazing. Phone didn't overheat and the app runs in the background so even though the screen was off, it kept recording. A+++",

I'll tell you that I immediately Uninstalled the other apps that I previously had tested because its \"the one\"!! It has all the options you need for a webcam (zoom, mirror e.t.c.) and Its 720p but with some better lightining it looks like 1080p, so I would definitely recomend this app!!",
      "It works really well with good quality (and Linux support). One small thing, can you remove the lock to portrait mode for the UI? I use it with my Pixel C (as it has a built in stand through the keyboard), but rotating my head 90° is annoying.",
      "Bought it.. used it for a couple of months.. Go to fire it up tonight for our weekly stream, and it won't connect anymore. Throws an error with the pc client saying the android clients needs to be updated. No about of uninstalling/reinstalling has solved the issue.. Zero forums to gleam any information from with this dev, zero support. Keep that in mind before you purchase it. It's great when it works, but you can find yourself in my shoes with a useless app."

      "Can not get my TV and Phone to connect... I keep get an error on TV and saids it can not connect to the internet on my phone. There is no direction for trouble shooting so when I tired for about 30 minutes to work with my electrics I decided that I want to just get my money back and now this app says I cant. What a rip off keeping money when you have only had the app less then an hour!!!",
      "The only improvement I can think of is if you could use the app to make your tv switch over to the corresponding app, like how an LG remote has buttons to open to certain apps. Or build in some remote control features to adjust volume and whatnot. Works great for what I want it to!",
      "I love this app, it's an optimal experience that moves me and enhances my life by opening me to new sounds, movies and the world! I highly recommend it.",
      "Been using it without issue for 2 year with the chrome cast except for minor hickup here and there. Would appreciate if there was a \"history tab\" that you can go to and back. Been waiting for that for so long. All and all good job developers.",
      "Changing my review from was an Amazing App to customer service sucks . Bought the paid version 2 years ago and recently these guys released new paid version app and since then I have been facing problems with my paid app version. Customer service sucks at resolving issues. Developers deserve a 🍺 because it's an incredible app, but marketing manager and customer satisfaction department and CEO sucks."

      "The only problem is cheap interfaces! With a decent device, not the garbage sold on Fakebook, it does what it says. One really annoying problem is that it refuses to quit. Doesn't matter how many times you close it, Quit or even Force Stop, it's like a Premiership manager and bounces back, demanding to be connected. This can lead to problems with the cheapo devices as you can't pair and then open the app.",
      "App freezes, stops responding, then completely fails to load. Delete from device. Reinstall. Fails to load. Application is useless because there is no product support. Nobody will help you. You cannot contact the manufacturer. They take your money. When it does not work, you are at a loss. Do not throw your money away. Use FORScan or equivalent. Even in it's working configuration, this app does not allow you to access your car's computer to make any changes. You cannot remap your air-to-fuel ratio. You cannot change your transmission shift points, or adjust the transmission shift from firm to soft. You cannot change the profile settings for tire size. You can not enable or disable any settings. When it works, before the app crashes, freezes, and fails' it's just a glorified monitor. Information which is already accessible via your onboard display screen.",
      "I have been using it for 5 years now, along with plugins, with el-cheapo dongles and the recommended ones, across 2 Android phones. Although used with older than '12 cars, it has been completely reliable, dependable and trustworthy to have diags on the engines. Cheaper dongles do give the occasional connection hiccup, but that isn't the app's fault. I also like the ability to work with the plugins for simulator games to be used as a HUD! It might take a bit of time to configure, but that's it!",
      "I have a VW Passat B5.0 2.8 V6 30v 4 motion/synchro with a few problems, like a miss fire, but the error code count is 0 or zero. All I can get out of this app is what's already on my dashboard so it's totally useless for me as it doesn't do what I have paid it to do. Please show me some firkin error codes. There has to be some. Plus the help is just awful. Its a complex app so proper help would be appreciated. Oh and tested on two modules. Just junk.",
      "It's an amazing app; I've used it for years. A definite 5-stars for functionality. However, only 4-stars overall due to very poor UI design. While it's very powerful, learning to use it is a real chore, and even after my years of use, I still feel like I'm not getting everything out of it that it has to offer, due to it's convoluted interface. A future interface refresh would be very welcome."

      "It's a nice app that's worth the purchase of the pro version. I haven't even got to use all the full functions yet because it covers all of my basic needs. I've needed an scanning app to store important documents that I shred, and now I'm also starting to use it for storing receipts as well. It's a versatile way of keeping your documents organized with good export features.",
      "Free version is more then enough to use this app to scan in homework assignments documents etc. Simply take a photo and then adjust the image to pull only the portions of the image to create a PDF. From there adjust brightness to final PDF. Choose method of transfer ie email. Pro version allows multiple projects and additional method of transfer I choose to support the app not for the features but because the quality is worth supporting.",
      "Useful tool, I've been using this app for a while and it was super handy to generate pdf files (mainly made out of marked up pictures) on the go to be emailed to relevant people which saved me a lot of time and I was able to attach much more pictures than doing it other way by attaching it individually to the email and being only half way in seeing a message that it's already over 25mb limit... Anyway - this was a brief description for one of many good uses for this app. Thumbs up Dev team!",
      "Does exactly what I need! Many college classes want me to send in a photo of hardcopy my work as a pdf. This app takes the picture of your paper and perfectly converts it into an easy to read pdf that your professors will be grateful for! The free version did everything I needed but I decided to buy the pro as it could directly upload to Google Drive among others. A great app I highly recommend!",
      "This app is great except for a critical flaw: it can't do landscape docs. I scanned 19 pages, flipping each one, just to find they all got cropped and centered in larger portrait pages. What's so hard about scanning a landscape document? Those are not a rare thing."

      "There is quite a noticeable amount of latency when trying to play and record. I am running this on a Samsung Galaxy S10. Also I found it difficult to navigate how to simply turn on the metronome to record. I've been using Logic and Ableton for 8 years and this is confusing as hell. Thought this would be a great mobile alternative to Garageband on iPhone. If that's what you're looking for then don't buy this. I feel £10 has been wasted. The built in sounds on offer are great however.",
      "This is the best app ive ever found everything is coming together with updates i really appreciate the fact that when saving a wave it dousnt save as a seperate project with all your other projects.. but one more step could be used when saving.. like when i have a song saved as for example.. audio wave... and i solo out a sound that i want to save as a different name like.. horn wave.. it will not save it as a seperate project which is good however my origianal project name switches to wave name",
      "Absolutely amazing! I have made 5 songs with this app and I've uploaded them to my YouTube channel : Maklap It does feel a little hard at the beginning but after a while,you'll get used to the controls. Love the app ^^",
      "This is a great app to make music on. I am 12 years old, and why this is a great app is because it lets me unleash my creativity, and my love for music, keep up the good work Image Line.",
      "Pretty great app and it has no ads and it has very great preset sounds along with the ones you have to buy. This is a great app there is alot you can do with this app."

      "It's a really great editor for sure, but I do have things that are incredibly annoying and NEED to change. First is getting more accurate values (floats) able to be used, it's hard to make minor RNG changes when you have to divide by a range of values that make these decimals. Second, choosing specific countries to be effected. There has to be an easier way that choosing the population count to target it. Sometimes things that should do 2 things do only 1, but the other stuff needs fixing first.",
      "Pretty detailed and fun, however there are a few bugs with the interface. For example there are times when I'll finish writing out the scenario description and move on to writing out pop-up descriptions, only to find my scenario description has been partially erased. This is depite the fact that it tells me I can put 8,000 characters into the description when I don't even have 1,000 characters in my finished description which is a tad frustrating. All in all, fun but slightly buggy.",
      "Great creator and all, but when I made a scenario and tested it the lethality was high but once the disease killed a couple hundred people the lethality stayed high but no more people died. I checked the lethality of everything and the government actions and stuff but it didn't have any stuff to bring the lethality down. Please fix it.",
      "Wish the world news and announcements from the government was easier to understand. Trying to add those to make it as realistic and original as possible.",
      "Great app and entertaining but the problem is that it does not give you a tutorial on how to use the app. It's a bit confusing hooe you add a tutorial soon. I still enjoy using it the app."

      "The double tap to lock screen is giving me headache. When I double tapped for the first time, it showed me two methods. Accessibility (requiring Android 9) and Device admin. I turned on the accessibility method in the setting and it worked fine. But after few hours it again showed me the same message. I checked in the setting but the accessibility was turned on. I turned it off and again turned it on again but still it didn't work. Restarted the phone and it worked but again same problem.",
      "I honestly love this app, its so much nicer than OneUI in my honest opinion. Especially if you get some nice Icon packs to go along with it and some nice wall papers. 10/10 ign. Would recommend 👌 👍. The swipe gestures are so nice, being able to swipe down from anywhere to bring down the notifications. MMmmMm so good. I did just get this launcher yesterday, but so far no complaints at all. I will update my review if I find any problems. 100% recommend this for 5$ though. Very worth it. Nice!!",
      "I've been using this launcher for quite some time. I especially like the ability to scroll the docker in addition to and independently of the region above. One thing that came in especially handy recently when I upgraded to a new phone was the ability to export the detailed set up, including apps, folders positions and so on. The transfer app I used forgot a lot. The launcher didn't. I was able to get back things the way I had them, using the shortcuts to apps to download what was missing.",
      "Honestly, really like this app. It's great and I love using it a lot. However, there are some things that do bother me, and it's the glitch that keeps happening when I go to recent apps with the android 10 gestures. It'll all of a sudden zoom in very closely and sometimes it'll disorient me because I'll be confused as to what just happened. Other times, it just gets annoying. Otherwise, great launcher. Going to try out lawnchair and see what happens.",
      "Overall, really great launcher. I'm using this on my s8, and the only issue I have is with the app drawer. The options you have are pretty limited, as everything is always in alphabetical order, and you can't move apps around. Also the fact that you have to go into the launcher app to create folders and then pick out apps to put inside folders, instead of just being able to create one inside the app drawer, is super frustrating and time consuming."

      "I find this app very good, the constellation arts are accurate, and it also provides information on stars. Only problem I found is, it doesn't have images of objects other than stars and planets in the information section. For example, Andromeda and Sombrero galaxy. This information is helpful when I'm stargazing through a telescope and need to find these objects. Also the angle of view of the sky is very low. Most of the time, I can't see a complete constellation in one screen.",
      "Love it! Big help in locating specific stars, planets, constellations, meteor showers, you name it. Beats the heck out of trying to identify things using just a book. When I got my current phone, I installed quite a few astronomy apps and tried them all, thinking I'd keep the top three and use all three for maximum information and different perspectives. After a few days, I found myself using this app exclusively. Don't need anything else... Just make sure you calibrate it right.",
      "Each time I get a new phone, I always try at least two other, new to me, sky map apps, I always come back to this one. It's easy to use. Their screen is stable making it essy to mark the object of interest. There isn't clutter all over the screen. All the information needed is right on the screen. I love this app and it's worth the upgrade. A solid five star app.",
      "Still not fixed. I have my location on! I jave calibrated as they said. This app would be great IF it said I was pointing in the right direction. i am pointing north and it thinks im between south and south east. Please fix this! I hoped buying this app would make it more accurate but nope. I shouldnt have bought this. Terrible with proper direction.",
      "Yesterday I was at my friend's house, and we were discussing if he'd have sun on his balcony during the summer. With this app I turned back the time to June, found the sun and showed him the trajectory with the AR view. He was stunned. I love this application, it allows me to explore the universe and inspire others. The design is minimalist, yet flexible and full of useful features. I've tried several similar applications, but this one is my go-to ❤️"

      "Wonderful game. Very cute art style. The gameplay is fun and well worth the 4 bucks I spent on it. My kid plays it for a couple of days and then she redownloads it a couple of months later to play again and she's been doing this for 2 years now! :) Most importantly, there are no ads and no in-app purchases after you buy the game. Great job guys!",
      "i love this game but some time it does not work correctly but it stops if i don't play the game for a while. when i grow up i want to do hair so it is so fun to be able to paly this game! i wish though that there was more options when you do there hair and i wish there was more people in the game. i learned about this game form my friend and whenever i go to her house that is all i wanted to do. but in 2019 for christmas i got a touch screen computer and all i have done is play it! thank you!!!",
      "Great app is it's fun, you can desging boys or girls. There are accessories, outfits, and more. there are so many backdrops and they look so cool. There is barely any ads for me I had no ads yet. Only thing I would want to say that is bad is tieing hair it's really hard to tie hair up in ponytails or buns. You can also dye hair. If you like doing other people's hair you should get this app. You also can't get bored easily.",
      "I really like this game but you should make it where your pictures actually save to your device so you can look at them later. I wish it was easier to make the hair look like its up in a ponytail or bun. You should also add makeup and more girl outfits that are cute and to change the color of eyes and to dye eyebrows. If you add these things i will like this game more and rate 5 stars. So theres a lot of things you should add but its still a fun game to play and make hairstyles.",
      "Works perfectly, I have never had a problem with this app. It is very creative and cute! It has no ads or in app purchases. This app allows my imagination to roam, and is very stress reducing."

      "Great app but I don't like the latest change to the save screen where modify original is now at the bottom of the screen and also seems less obvious than previously. You need a lot of finger travel to go from the save button (up arrow) at the top of the screen to the modify original button at the bottom of the following screen. I think those option buttons should be returned back to the top of the screen where they were previously.",
      "Been using this app for a couple of years now, and it is by far the best app for removing objects, and much more. I have used this app to rebuild parts of badly damaged old photographs, including part of my wife's face from a childhood pic with amazing results. I also don't notice any significant drop in image quality like with the majority of editing apps. Just a really, really great app that will always be in my tool kit.",
      "This is my go to app for quick photo editing - it is honestly almost like magic. The quick repair to remove items from pictures does a great job 95% of the time. If it does not blend well, which is infrequent, I find that you can can quickly undo and then repair it again and it will do a different repair. I am an Adobe Photography subscriber and prefer this over the repair in lightroom as it is quicker",
      "I came back to install this app and I must say. BETTER THAN BEFORE. I don't know how they did it but it's smart and immediately removed objects that it knows it's there and gone like it's never been there before. Happy with this purchase! 10/10",
      "I downloaded this because I had a photo that I'd taken that had some obnoxious power lines through the middle of it. This app helped me get rid of them and did it better and way more easily than with Photoshop. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality."

      "Nice app but I realise that really I've only paid for the absolute bones of the app and most of the actual content is subscription based so I got nothing really for my money. I've to pay another €12.99 to get the real content. I would expect the basic app to be free as there's nothing in there worth paying for from what I can see. Also the awards listed appear to relate to the content that you need to subscribe to rather than the app you're paying for so are misleading.",
      "Essentially a scam. You pay £4 for an app these days and you expect 2 things, content and quality. This has neither. Basically a calendar and some notes about development and then links to all the insanely expensive subscription content. The bounty app has better content and is free (with ads). Refund requested as its daylight robbery to sell a freemium product like this.",
      "Used to use this a lot and had purchased the ebook in app last year. Since they have changed to a subscription service, I've lost the information I paid for. Contacted the help desk and haven't had a response on the matter. The app used to be good but it's usefulness has declined with all the uodates. EDIT: have contacted the email provided a few times since 21st January with no action taken. Will be uninstalling this app. Would not recommend to others.",
      "You can read all info online. I downloaded and thought it was rubbish so cancelled it. Unless you pay for a subscription the information you get in the app which YOU HAVE TO PAY for is no different to what you get online. My friends used it and recommended it, so I downloaded it again thinking it had changed. Didnt realise they pay the subscription. It's not worth it unless you pay extra to subscribe",
      "If I could rate this a 0 star I would. I reached out to support to ask how to even use this app. A week later with many questions still no help. The entire user interface has me bewildered. Not very user friendly at all. I strongly urge a revamp of the design. It's extremely confusing and difficult to understand. I would like to have my money back."

      "After the most recent update the app stopped showing notifications when I would get messages from my work. My phone does not notify me anymore of direct messages or sent to all would appreciate this bug being fixed I am missing out on crucial work announcements because I am not being notified. Yes I have checked all my phone settings and there is nothing blocking notification from this app. Please help and fix this bug!!",
      "Once you're past the slow load time, the app is okay. But it can easily take 10-15 minutes for the app to open. I dread every time I have to open the app to see my schedule. I know, even after the app has opened, the schedule will be another 5 minutes populating.",
      "Truly a pleasure to use! Not.. Honestly a shockingly subpar app that seldomly works. Really don't get how such a simple app can run so poorly. Most of all that I would like from the app it would be being able to log on smoothly without having to wait minutes for it to decide to even give me the log-in boxes, let alone the minutes to wait once you can finally log on. Really unfortunate that this is the app my job opts for to push out its schedules...",
      "Waste of money because the website is free. This app is terrible. I thought it would be better then checking the website periodically but it's not. Besides being very slow, the app hardly ever loads. I have all my notifications on yet it does not notify me of anything ever. I had to request to pick up a shift twice because the first time it didnt go through. I only use it because I've already paid for it. Use the free website instead.",
      "Seriously what is wrong with this app it's a simple work scheduling app and yet the devs can't optimize a system. You literally pay 3$ for this to be constantly updated with no changes and constant hamster wheel loading screens. Please fix this holy fjsofbb this is AWFUL!!"

      "Has alot of different tools that are very accurate to the point and they work as intended. Has very interesting features that are neccessary for ghost detecting and hunting. This app is very different unlike any others apps that are like it. Its very useful for everyday use , and I just wanted to say thank you so much to the developers of this app very well done!",
      "Nothing seems to happen, I always feel energy in here, even see things move, That's why I bought this app. Maybe it's just not here now?? Nothing yet so far though unfortunately....just a bunch of annoying noises when I MOVE the phone....the lines jump when I move the phone....its like a prank on people more than anything so far...",
      "I like it. If nothing else, it's super fun to play with. I think the negative reviews are unfair, especially since the creator is more than willing to give refunds if asked. I mean, for $2.49 you turn your phone into a fun ghost hunting device, when all of these things separately would cost between $30 to $400+ dollars. I'm having fun with it :) Thank you for your cool app!",
      "This app is very extensive and has many well designed tools. I've already started having fun but not as much as when I have a better working knowledge the attributes of the app. I was considering going to a cemetery to do some evp's as a test. I recommend that you try this app, you will be satisfied. I'll update my review after I can make a better report. Thank you, Dev.",
      "Looks like it would be a fantastic app. My phone wasn't equipped to handle all the features. Apparently my phone doesn't have the capability for EMF. The developer was very understanding and I got a full refund. I wish all developers were this nice!"

      "Really enjoy using the app, it makes it easier to play games with a controller. The only thing that I have a problem with is after you activate the app on the computer after a spand of time when not using the app or restarting phone due to updates or other reasons to restart a phone I have to reactivate the app and it's quite annoying to have to reactivate multiple times, the app would be great if you only had to activate it once.",
      "not responsive. using ds4 bluetooth controller, rooted poco f1. It does active automatically, no need pc coz im rooted. but keys and analogs are not too responsive. need to click keys several times, analog sticka not smooth its always lag late response. playing on Ragnarok Mobile and Marvel Future Fights. Not yet tested on ML.. i'll wait for the fix or update before i refund. thank you devs!",
      "Works like a charm. Yet after a restart it needs you to confirm the app with your computer. Bit annoying. Just like the \"rate us\" spam. It doesn't recognize when you put in 3 or 4 stars. Only with 5 stars you get redirected to the play store to put in your review. And when you give it 3 stars it will always ask again untill you give it 5 stars. So the rating in the Playstore is basically a scam. Will report this to Google play.",
      "It's a great app that I finally decided to pay for it. Does exactly what it says. There is just one thing missing from this app though: NO KEYMAPPING PROFILE. It would be great if we can create multiple keymap options that we can set up and switch to on the fly depending on what game or mode we're going to play. Only then and probably I will also buy panda activator kit.",
      "Not sure why so many low ratings. The app works very well. Much better than octopus for me. Octopus had significant input delay for me but this is great. Yes the activating is kind of annoying. This app is significantly better if you have a rooted device. You never need to active it with a computer. My phone is now a permanent on the go gaming device using a controller and I love it."

      "The generator is ok. Many \"Examples\" in the memes lean extremely to the left and attack conservative values. I would go as far as saying the creator is inputting his/her political bias within the app. For this reason I would recommend everyone to avoid downloading this app. Choose a different one on playstore. Don't support this type of division.",
      "I've been using this app for years, and was happy to pay for it. Overall, I love this app and wouldn't even think of using anything else...but I HATE that you've removed the Impact font in favor of some wack knock-off version. EDIT AFTER DEV REPLY: Thanks for explaining the licensing fees for the font. I hadn't realized (though I should have!) FIVE STARS for a five-star app.",
      "Great app, allows font importing, sticker maker, and other good tools. My biggest problem is it doesn't save as PNG as far as I know (so there is image compression), and if you have alot of pages you run using various repeat stickers there is no organization. A folder option for the custom sticker section would be great!",
      "This is an awesome meme generator! Making memes is easy with this app. I like the examples for inspiration, they also make me laugh. With tons of images, the ability to use my own pictures, text controls, and options, this is the best and easiest way I've found to make memes. I paid for the pro version because it's worth it.",
      "Had this app for a while bought it to impress a girl, worked like a charm. Now that I have begun to meme I have found it to be quite entertaining. Simple interface makes meming a pleasant experience. Many options to change it up if wanted. Over all a solid app that is updated regularly. Keep up the good work, the development team behind this app is phenomenal."

      "The app serves it's purpose. However it sometimes seems to make screen unlock slower than it should. For last few weeks it two to three seconds to unlock my Pixel 3a screen. After rebooting to safe mode the phone unlocked in less than a second. Also, after that I deleted the app and screen unlock got faster also in normal mode. Weird since I don't have any profiles set. EDIT: To answer, AFAIK no. I haven't been using the app much since I switched to this phone.",
      "Changed my review from 1 star to 5 stars. The power of Tasker and amount of crowd-coding available is worth the time it takes to understand the process and operation of the app. And that's just the app. The support from the developer is all there. In any case, I am a bit embarrassed for leaving such a bad review before making an honest effort to learn the basics.",
      "Wonderful app. the only downside I found untill now that the response for the proximity sensor event/state is not quicker as macrodroid. it takes around 1.5-2 seconds which is very problematic. if it gets fixed then it would be very good. Also, We can't set that when should proximity sensor event/state should trigger (near to proximity sensor, far, fast wave, slow wave ETC.) as macrodroid.",
      "Very powerful tool/app. Price starts to add up as you enable the various plug-ins required to do whatever it is your are trying to do. I would be completely fine with the price IF it was reliable. I have a spare (old) ATT ZTE K88 (running Android 5.1.1) that I'm using as a dedicated ring door bell 2 display. Any time someone rings the doorbell, Tasker, AutoInput, AutoNotification kick in and wake the device from sleep, activate the ring rapid application. 40 seconds later, Tasker (and plugins) spring to life again and close out the ring rapid. Problem is that the above doesn't always happen. ** UPDATE ** So I tweaked things a bit. The way I was closing out the ring rapid wasn't correct (ring continued to live feed after I \"closed\" that app). My new method (auto input: click the coordinates where the hangup button is) seems to be working. I'm gonna try this out for some time and increase app rating if it behaves. For those interested, here is my configuration ** AutoNotification Intercept ** Notification Type = created ** Task 1 = AutoInput Unlock screen ** Task 2 = AutoNotification Action (Notification App = Rapid Ring) ** Task 3 Wait 40 seconds ** Task 4 AutoInput Action Click (coordinate x, y - x,y will be unique to your device) ** Task 5 Wait 1 second ** Task 6 AutoInput Global Action: Back",
      "I've been using Tasker for a few years now. It's a must have for me because I like automating most things...plus it's just fun to play with and figure out what can be done. However, the last two updates have only slowed the app down, caused it to crash, and caused profiles I have such as ones that use the screen unlocked event to take up-to 5 minutes to execute--a lot of the time the profiles don't execute. I'm not sure what changed but it slows down & renders my entire device almost useless."

Google store says its unlocked, pc google store says its unlocked, but app says other wise. Ive asked the dev to send me my serial key so I can manually enter it. My fingers are crossed Dev is still around to help out. Otherwise its been a great app.",
      "FoxFi has been working for 2-3 years now. I only paid once which was great. There have been updates with android....and the developers have been able to keep up. However this most recent Samsung android update (2/6/2020)....FoxFi has stopped working. The FoxFi key doesn't work at all. I'm hoping the developers of the FoxFi app are working on a solution.",
      "DON'T BUY FULL VERSION, IT STILL DISCONNECT YOU. This is a good apps to share our unlimited internet quota to other users, but will suddenly disconnect every hour and we user need to manually reconnect it. Developer said if we paid for full version, we won't have this disconnecting issue. It is a big LIE.. I PAID, and now i still have the disconnecting issue. If they fix this disconnecting issue, I will change my review. If you still saw this review, means they have not fix it.",

The only thing is the GPS tracking sucks, it never tracks my run properly so I always have to manually calculate it and enter it in.",
      "So awesome! Much better than trying to run on your own. I enjoyed the guidance it gave me-- I just thought, \"until it tells me to stop running!!\" As I tried to exercise. That way I definitely ran more than I would have. Plus it tells you cool stuff at the end of the run, like how many calories I burned, how long I ran, etc. which I always like to see.",
      "This app has not tracked my distance right once. GPS accessed enable, high accuracy selected, but it continues to track .9 miles in a half hour to as low as .2 miles. Luckily I have another app running that clocks the full 2 miles I run. At this point i only use this app for the run /walk queues",
      "THE WORST. SAVE YOUR MONEY! This used to be a good app 5 years ago but apparently the developers already made their money and have moved on. App crashes constantly and will erase all of your data. SO frustrating. I reached out to their support group - finally got a response about a week later asking me to assist them with troubleshooting. By that time I had already purchased another app so I requested a refund. That question got me a swift and immediate response of \"NO\". There are plenty of other good apps out there. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this one.",
      "So I really like the app for helping me to build up running as someone who's new to it. But it never records my run, am I doing something wrong?! If it starts recording it would be 5*, I just want to be able to see when I've run and what I did on that run."

      "The app was fun at first, but i kept playing it throught the day and finished it when it became dark out so i completed it in about 6 hours since i only played like 10 to 20 minutes per lets say 2 hours and once i finished it became useless.I couldnt do anything it was boring, so i suggest you dont buy this app if your kid asks you to get it for them .",
      "I really do like this game I always wanted it but I would suggest being able to mix the elements together to make the game longer it is short but that is because it is super addictive at the start over all amazing game just hoped it would longer",
      "It was fun at first! But after playing for a while more, it got boring. I realised that unlocking all the elements took a shorter time (1h) than I had expected. Therefore, it wasn't as fun as I thought before I downloaded the game. It became boring as I didn't have anything else left to play. However, the game is interesting and engaging. I would like the game to last longer next time and not tell us how to unlock the other elements. I prefer to find out how to do so by myself.",
      "This game was fun! But it needs an update. Please add elements 119-172 , Custom elements and molecules. and boring bug fixes.",
      "Can you fix that if you refund it so it gives back the money that you spent on the game because my brother was playing on my phone and he uninstalled the game and I was sad so please fix that and I will buy this game and some other games by you guys too. : ) That's the reason I gave it 3 stars : ("

      "I see a lot of negative reviews for this, however I have not had any issues for what it's worth. Connected to our server inside our network and outside the network. Stayed connected and worked great. Your mileage may very but for .99 it is worth trying if you think you could use it.",
      "Absolutely terrible... App UI freezes and it becomes fully unresponsive. Even if I close the app, it still runs in the background and I have to either restart my phone, or force stop services. An application that I paid for shouldn't work like this. 1 star till this is fixed. I have this bug for more then a year... It makes the app fully useless...",
      "This app allows you to securely communicate with friend with good server, data usage depends on bitrate being set to specific channel and audio quality is pretty decent but I want to see some of the PC version features like: being able to disable microphone so you don't have to disconnect in order to record something else like Instagram story, also I would like to see internal echo reduction for unprocessed audio so we can maybe listen to music while talking, and also rework settings for look 😊",
      "First bought on an iPhone 7 years ago. Have it now on my Android phones. Still randomly crashes after 10 seconds after entering a server, and my phone needs to be restarted to get the application to run again. Just like old times. Added a star because it at least lets people know I left the office.",
      "Wow the app is totally a mystery in how to use it. There is the voice that keeps informing you of activity but the volume is so low you can not hear unless the spraker is to your ear. No way to find a channel you might be interested in as far as I know. No help guides to look at so gurss better go online to try to find something. Hope it works good and I can figure it out. People seem to use it on there network rsdios."

      "Hi i like this game because of the secret hideout and the hospital stuff but i wish something cool happened when you find and put all the sloths inside the tank i was very dissappointed when nothing happened because i thought something would happen. I thought you could actually have a character have a baby in this game like give birth but you just change the clothes to make it look not pregnant and then pick up a baby. 😑",
      "Make it possible to cure sick patients in the app. The app is a great for kids going through the hospital system or kids who experienced hospital stays. The adult version allows the player to make patients sick, but the kid version does not, so it's less effective than it could be for kids who use the app to come to terms with their experience. Letting kids who have been through the hospital system play the adult version can traumatize due to the inability to cure patients once they're sick.",
      "I love this game!! Amazing for kids and teens. This game makes you go from bored to happy! You can operate on people, get cured and its like a real hospital. 5 stars!!!",
      "My children love the Toca games and asked for this one. Unfortunately I can't seem to add it to Family Library which is disappointing as it means I've bought it on my phone but they can't play it on their tablets. All other Toca games have added successfully.",
      "It was a good game but I recommend not getting it because it's just a hospital and no homes and nothing?? So it was an ok games, but there is just no homes and no park there was no way you could leave.. So yeah. I don't recommend this if you get bored easily."

      "New fuzzy search is absolutely ridiculous. Tags and tittle are correct (also edited manually), still showing random album art in completely different language. I'm legit pissed off because before Poweramp was a PERFECT app, my favorite. Hoping for a change, maybe revert back to previous logic. Everything else is totally wonderful, but the first thing that you see when you start the app is the album art and it's really annoying to see something else. Will change once everything is back.",
      "V3 sucks. It's inferior to v2 and a major step back. You can't seek the music while you're on the Playlist anymore like on v2. You can't number the Playlist track (even the olden days Winamp does this!) so if you know its track #77 on the playlist, have it jump automatically to that. Sad that music players back in 2000 is superior to this. Editing playlists is a major PIA with this. There is no good playlist editor on android",
      "Near perfection! I downloaded the trial version, and bought this unlocker within a day of use. It's that good. The EQ alone is worth it, and outshines almost every other music player. After buying ProjectM app I found that the milkdrop visualization files work in tandem with Poweramp flawlessly. The only downside is an inability to recognise shared network folders via WiFi like VLC player. For that reason alone, VLC is slightly better, but Poweramp is now my main music player, vs. VLC for video.",
      "I've never needed another music player and I bought this app years ago for a buck. It plays pretty much any audio file type and has anything I can imagine that you'd need to customize your experience UI-wise and audio-wise. The only caveat is getting used to navigating the interface because tapping on any part of the screen does something.",
      "Can anyone recommend a music player that does NOT get killed by the battery saver. This app keeps getting killed so it turns itself off after a short while of playing. There seems to be no support by app the app makers to prevent this. Other than that it could have been a great player."

      "First, I'd like to say this is best metronome/tuner on the market. With that being said, it can still improve: Quite difficult to be precise in the option to stretch tempo by percentage, perhaps a wheel--like with tempo in metronome--could be easier and more intuitive. Lastly, recording ability can be improved by making it easier to scroll up or down the list of your takes. 4.5/5 ⭐",
      "Absolutely love being able to add an accel/rit to the metronome. There are also many subdivisions that are really help as well. The only problem I have is that I can't play the metronome app while recording a video, which is definitely an essential feature for video assignments. If this problem is only occurring for me, I would love it if someone can help me out with that. Again I love this app, but a small detail like that can hinder some important elements for recording. Thanks! :)",
      "Ok. This is a GREAT tuning app. It is also very cute! I love the smile when I get the note right and it encourages me to play longer. It has a metronome and it will still play if you are in other apps. Like you could be in YouTube playing another video and it still plays! Overall a great app. You should get it NOW.",
      "Great app, but the huge battery drain on android makes it useless for a practice session. So only ok for a quick tune up which is does very well.",
      "A very good all in one app that is essential for any musician, and well worth the price. One thing that I specifically love about this app is the pitch wheel, which does a great job at developing intonnation skills rather than just looking to see pitch. I've started using it as my metronome app too and I've been very pleased."

It has a lot of info for class options and races and a basically solid interphase so it is shocking as you run into its short coming like a lack of multi-closing functions, no easy inventory/equipment management and no feats. I really like what is there but for the money I feel like there is just too much stuff that is missing. I hope they continue to expand functionality because if it had all the needed features this would be the best 5e character app on the market.",
      "Very in depth, i like how easy and accessible everything is, but i wish there was an option to choose multiclass. Most of my characters have been multiclassed characters and i like the individuality it gives them. I know not every campaign does it, but it would be incredibly helpful (to me) if it was added in as a level up option.",
      "Its absolutely amazing, there are some minor kinks to work out but overall it is a good app. The only reason I'm not giving full stars is because they dont have the bloodhunter class, and thats a let down for paying 5 bucks. If this is fixed Id definitally give five stars, and even change this to an outstanding review if they worked out the minor kinks.",
      "Pretty good app, automatically does all the calculations i need when creating/leveling characters, sometimes things can be difficult to understand with the calculations, like some race/class combos give ac class and i cant figure out why it came up with the specific number (tortle monk ac of 20 for example) i would love if they could add homebrew race option (design your own race) as it would need to be approved by a dm anyways, all in all pretty awesome app, super helpful, 100% worth it",
      "It is not easy to load existing characters, as the values are not easily amended once you get past intimal setup. Although there is a ability rolling function it doesn't auto include things like jack of all trades. Weapons have to be manually added which surprised me. I was really hoping for more, considering the number of support apps available from the developer I hoped things like items would be incorporated into the character sheet"

      "Just downloaded this pro-version after Quick Pic failed to correct their latest corrupted update. This app is as simple and easy to navigate. However, I have noticed more customizable features that are great. Worth the price. Only have one suggestion, if they could make it possible to also link/pin folders to phone's desktop, that was a feature I utilized often for quick viewing. **Edit Update** this linking to desktop issue I have is still a problem. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and same.",
      "Great app, awesome updates. Would love a feature that enables animations when you click a thumbnail that zooms in and out so it's easy to see which photo you were just looking at (hard to tell when you're coming a bunch of screenshots that look similar to each other).",
      "Would be 5 stars except for Naming feature. You must rename entire name, or place a prefix or suffix with the current name. I would like to be able to rename a group of files with a file number that counts up with each file.",
      "I've really enjoyed most of this app, but I've found recently that when I select a photo and move it to a different folder, it deletes the photo instead. Not sure what causes this issue, but it's definitely put me off the app. Aside from this one, however, I had no other issues. Edit: issue has been fixed",
      "I'd like to request an option to turn off the double tap pause/play function and revert to the original zoom-in as it was before. Better yet revert this recent change entirely if you can please. Review: By far the most customizable and in-depth in terms of options gallery app out there, only wish it would look more modern and fancy"

      "I am very impressed with the detail and depth of this app. The price, even with the in-app purchases are worth it. This is not a toy app for the average enthusiast. This is for serious photographers and cinematographers or those trying to realistically learn to be one of them. Note: This works best on the newer phones. I have the Galaxy S10+ and this app rocks on it. AAA+",
      "Payed for both the app and it's expansion pack. What a scam! It's no better than the open camera app. The log and flat profiles don't work on my phone ( ZenFone 6 ) showing large vertical flashing lines. The overall video quality even after playing with the settings is just poor. I was surprised at how badly the app performs considering its cost. My advice to anyone interested in buying would be. Download Open camera, in it's settings you'll find bit rate options, put it to 100ms.",
      "Whenever I change the orientation from vertical to horizontal on my Galaxy Note 10 Plus the app freezes. Overall underwhelmed considering it's price. Too bad I don't know another alternative app, maybe that's also why they charge it so much. Edit: Thank you for the quick response. I added one star for your hardworking team. The black screen frozen happens whenever I change my phone orientation from vertical to horizontal after I reopen the app, while the resolution is at 2K or above. 2nd Edit: I've sent a screen record to your email.",
      "Downloaded for my lg g6 and regret it. This app was not designed for this phone. Dropped frames. Audio issues. Bad quality footage no matter what settings I adjust and i tried everything. Limited capabilities even though it said it would work on my phone. Way more work than just using the reg android camera. Would like my money refunded.",
      "Love the app, I could imagine being able to make the UI a little more user-friendly though. Auto-focus settings are very unclear for example. >>> Aside of this I would also love an extra feature: The ability to use transparent PNG images to overlay the image. This way I can make a 3D render in Blender, and then overlay it in the screen, to make it match perfectly with the scene I'm filming. I remember such a feature being implemented on my 5D mII with Magic Lantern. This could also be a great feature to enable custom guides with for example the golden ratio. >>>>>I think it is great you can control the LUTs, but it would be also great to view and record in a different LUT, like with some professional monitors."

      "So far seems very functional, with the exception of one very annoying bug: whenever I try to search for an object in the free-look mode, the screen will flicker/stutter constantly with some random still frame and is extremely frustrating to deal with. Don't know if it's something wrong with mine personally because I don't seem to see anyone else having the same issue but it's very annoying. Hope it gets fixed soon.",
      "One month ago I initially downloaded the app to conttrol my telescope set up: Skywatcher Star Discovery 150 Syn Scan Wi Fi AZ Go To. It initially didn't quite work with my scope. However the support I received was unbelievable. Over the next version (within 2 weeks, over the Christmas and New Year holidays) the issue was technically fixed, something which took years for other apps. Obviously there is some very dedicated team working to develop a great app. I like also the approach in this app in comparison to other similar apps - its very sleek and user friendly design and the team's keen interest to develop it into a true digital astronomical assistant to amateurs. Would be very keen to follow the developments of this irreplaceable astronomical tool.",
      "Stellarium Mobile Plus is amazing!! i have tried other free/purchased astronomy apps, and this one has superior functionality, larger catalog of objects with a user friendly search feature for clusters, messier objects, stars and planets. i love the zoom in/out and was able to locate objects like ic1101, and view objects names from various historical cultures. the only thing I asked for was the ability to toggle kilometers to miles, and my email received a reply within a few hours. i have",
      "Awesome app I am using this frequently for stargazing, however I think the rendering the object names in regional language is a missing feature. The desktop app have an option to display the regional names for stars and planets which is missing here. The names of the object are fine but the script is still English.",
      "I've been an occasional amateur astronomer since the 1980s. This is my first use of an e-Star Atlas and I must say that this app is amazing, very well thought out, extremely easy to navigate with very responsive zooming and an intelligent menu system. It's also a wonderful mobile teaching tool for introducing newcomers to celestial and planet motion, (using the time slider), constellations, DSOs etc. On my Samsung S9 phone the active tracking after calibration works perfectly. Very well done!"

      "Initially I had the free version and liked it a lot. The ads were not annoying or obtrusive and I could have lived with the freebe. But, it's such a cool and worthwhile tool that I opted for the premium version. (Which, by the way, is the first app I've ever paid for.) As a consequence of having this app and by doing some research I discovered my router control panel!! And, I learned about things like WiFi Scan Throttling. Yeah, right?",
      "I tried the free version because my wifi kept buffering even though I have a 200mb per second plan. I was able to figure out the problem using the app and make adjustments to fix it. The difference in my amazon fire 10 tablet is impressive. Before it was sooooo slow that I was about to get rid of it. Runs just fine now. My roku 4k tv is no longer buffering all the time. Anyway this app proved so useful I bought the premium version which I like even better.",
      "Nice Job! Visual development is nicely done and the accuracy seems pretty good. Feature set is on par or better than other similar tools. Seems very stable and user friendly. Worth the purchase. Thanks for you efforts in developing this tool. It's helpful in design and optimization of my worel network.",
      "I have tools that can't compare to this utility ... I'm impressed with the response, refresh, help, signal tracer, suggested channels, easy to use and as in depth as you choose to go. Will help novice and professionals alike, leaves very little to be desired, no crashes yet and im working it!",
      "Exceptional at finding clear channels for your area wifi. Signal strength graphs good. I get graphs with most local networks all the same colour, green. This makes it difficult to tell which network is which when there are 10 in my area. (I probably just haven't figured out how to yet)"

      "I love most toca Boca games. This one is just a total rip off. Ok so I saw the picture of four apartments and was like, Yas! But when I got in it only had two apartments, and I only had half the characters as they said I would have. When went back to get a refund that option was gone. If you guys want me to change the rating then either give me a refund, or update the game. And there is a luegie board behind the painting. Is that really apropriate for 6 year olds?",
      "Great! 4 floors as they promised, and all the characters! I just love hus, i love how there are boxes so you dont get others to hold your things......i recommend 5his, totally worth your money and time.",
      "I love this game, so many apartments to choose from. The cafe is AWSOME, and there are even some secrets (suprises) too! If you haven't played this game yet, you should try it, it's amazing!",
      "This app works just fine! And adding it to toca world is fun to! I like the apartment and the restraunt. The restraunt is bright and colorful and exciting! And the apartment is small but fun to interact and roleplay with. I like how two floors can feel like four because of the rooms. This app is simple yet so fun. Like all the toca life games.",

      "This is hands down THE best mobile recording app I've ever used. I'm no professional, but I record my class notes so I can listen to them on the go, and I've found I don't even need my microphone! Even when recording lectures from the very back of a room it sounds like the speakers are talking directly into my phone!!! I was more than happy to buy the Pro version after using the free one for a long time, and I would have gladly paid waaaay more for something of this quality. Thank you SO MUCH!!!",
      "So far so good, just upgrade and when I did I lost a previous recording I had on the free program, this upsets me I needed that recording, not a happy camper! Update 03!14/2020 Still using this app, and have recorded many conservatives also many Church services. I'm sure that you will find this a app useful for many occasions and easy to use.",
      "Love this app.. I probably bought it if that was an option just to avoid ads in case there were any (I hate ads) so not sure about that but the app itself is quite amazing..its way too easy to use and the recordings are very clear..no scratching or background noise I've found in the other apps I trief...I dont do ratings very often..this is probably my 3rd in 53 years so that should tell you it's worth trying. .you won't have to delete this one and move on to the next.",
      "Functional, navigable, and the app that found me just in time when I needed to record my singing the most and was being discerning about the apps I would install. I have used both the paid and full versions, both without crashes or issues. The captured quality is impeccable at 44 kilohertz, given at least 2 feet of proximity. For music, I still suggest review of waveforms for clipping (distortion) in an audio editor such as Audacity, as the graphical bar feedback only displays in realtime. 👍🎤",
      "I have used this app for my Podcast so many times with no problem however now when I transfer the file to my Dropbox it doesn't transfer as an MP3 it transfers as it just megabytes with no file extension. The file won't play anywhere except from inside the app. I can't upload it to my Podcast player, nothing, this is so upsetting. I just figured out that now I must add the .mp3 extensionby hand even though record .mp3 is checked in the app."

      "What a great app! Super simple to use - just tick the items you want to disable and they turn off. I had to turn Facebook Installer back on in order to install something, so I unticked it, installed my app, then ticked it again. Worked immediately with no restart required. Not sure whether it has improved performance, but from a privacy perspective I like to turn off all those Bixby/Google/Facebook processes and for GearVR it lets me use it as a cardboard headset.",
      "Didn't work Samsung 9. List that identifies all the bloatware not available after multiple attempts to obtain and save as instructed. Reached out to customer service who responded i.mediately with, \"we don't know which package disabler you purchased\" & that it's only good for about 6 months due to developers changing code, etc. I responded immediately with receipt for package disabler pro purchased that day. No response after that. Do not give device administrator privileges or you can't uninst",
      "The app works as expected on my Galaxy S9 with Android 10. A little disappointed that I needed to buy this app again after the developer changed the name and the old version no longer being updated and not working on anymore. Would be a five star if not for that. One last point, it doesn't seem to be able to disable packages inside of the secure folder, but that might be a limitation of Knox.",
      "It lists bloatware and there are boxes to check, but if you go to the drop down menu, there's no setting to disable the app you check and there's no info on how to do it. If you tap uninstall, it uninstalls package disabler pro instead of the app you checked the box for. I would appreciate some advice. Thanks",
      "It's a great app and does what it's supposed to without rooting. Been using it since Note 4. But I think this is my 3rd time buying it? I understand you keep getting taken off the store. But at least give us that paid in the past free access. The last version stopped working entirely, even tho I had it installed when it was taken off. Now I have 2 versions on the same phone lol. It's cheap, but still, it isn't fair to us loyal to you."

      "Like the game, GREAT concept but for 3.99 I was expecting more. More levels, more pets, more opportunity for game play. I am very disappointed with this game as games that cost around this amount generally take longer than 10 minutes to reach the end point. It would be nice to hear what my 3.99 went towards if its not for the game itself.......... will be uninstalling :(",
      "My 3 year old is obsessed with it. Would be better if there were different levels considering this is a paid app.",
      "It's fun in all but if you can can you try to add more pets to make the game more fun maybe? 😊",
      "There needs to be more to the game. My child helped all the animals in minutes. As the sun went down in the app, I expected new animals. I was very disappointed to return to start. But my child played on. I do not think it will hold attention for long.",

After closing the app I have to restart my phone to get the cameras working again to take photos. My phone is Sony Xperia X. It worked perfectly before latest update. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling a few times - doesn't fix problem. Edit: thanks for getting back to me on a Saturday... I've mailed support as advised.",
      "Absolutely excellent app, worth every penny! I love the aesthetic",
      "I'm a paid customer and now I have to open the app from here to unlock the features. Any ideas how I can sort it out?",
      "A really nice touch to old school (or retro whatever you want to call it) recording. I love how nice and simple it is to use and the fact that you can add a title in the middle. Would like to see more old school filters or a different variety, it would also be nice if somehow the voice or while you record the voices would sound a little off (like in the old camcorders) it would enhance the 80's vibe more. Also add an option to remove or keep the glitchy line, in the next update hope its soon.",
      "The pixels of the glitchy/grainy effect are so consistent that it isn't realistic looking. It also doesn't allow you to remove it. However, you can move it around to different areas of the screen and make it more intense which is a plus. Overall, it would be nice if the grain effect was more random or there was more user contol of it. This way, it would be harder to identify that the filmer is using this specific app and not a real VHS camcorder."

To achieve this we used Android accessibility libraries to make the tapping process easier. By providing an accessibility overlay button, drivers no longer need to awkwardly tap on the app to catch blocks. Flex Utility Premium provides one overlay button to handle all of the processes. This means that drivers no longer need to pay their full attention to their phone while tapping. With this app drivers may do other activities such as getting ready for the day while simultaneously tapping and catching blocks.\r\n\r\nBlock Filters\r\n\r\nThe app was designed by Flex drivers and has evolved into something that can suit a wide variety of drivers needs. Using the filters drivers can ensure that they'll only attempt to accept the blocks that they want. \r\n\r\nThe Station Code filter allows drivers to input the stations that they wish to work, the app will then only accept blocks with the provided station codes.\r\n\r\nUsing the Hours filter drivers can be sure that the app will only accept blocks of a desired length. Such as 3 hours, 4.5 hours, or both (3, 4.5). All filters allow for multiple entries using a comma to separate them. This allows for precise customization to suit any drivers specific needs.\r\n\r\nWith the Start Time filter drivers can ensure that they'll only accept blocks that start within a certain time. For example inputting 10,11,12 into the filter, the app will only attempt to accept blocks that start from 10:00 to 12:59.\r\n\r\nUsing the Pay filter drivers can really take control and set their rate. The pay filter allows for a greater than entry such as: >50 and the app will only grab blocks that pay $50 or more.\r\n\r\nBlock Log & Alert\r\n\r\nThe block alert feature plays a ding sound when a block matching the set filters appears on the Flex app. This lets drivers know when they need to pay attention to the phone and get ready to work a block.\r\n\r\nThe Block Log feature saves block information to a log view-able within the app. This is useful for seeing what blocks you may have missed. It's also very useful for determining when certain blocks drop at what times throughout the day. Block Logs can be exported to CSV for even more advanced analysis in a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nIn Short\r\nFlex utility Premium saves drivers time and headaches. Since the Flex app itself provides no sort of filtering, and many drivers have block preferences, we have created it ourselves. Flex Utility provides for a much more natural and intuitive tapping experience and the filters ensure that you'll be accepting the blocks that you truly want.\r\n\r\nRefunds\r\nI will refund the app in full at anytime, regardless of how long ago you may have purchased it. All that is required is for you to email me.\r\n\r\nWhat it isn't\r\nFlex Utility Premium is not an auto-tapper. The app does not guarantee that you will catch every block. This app is not a cheat, script, or a hack of any sort. We use legitimate libraries provided for Android to create it.

Because I had to reboot my device because when I tried to drag a person somewhere, they wouldn't go anywhere, all they would do is hop up a little. After I rebooted, I got back on, and after about 5 minutes, it happened again. You couldn't interact with anything, or drag. Please fix this bug so that I can enjoy this game again!",

I have those apps still, but they won't update. They just come up with an error message too. So I don't know if this is a device issue, or a game issue, but I would like if you could please try to fix it. Thank you!"

    "title":"Necrophonic",
    "description":"Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\r\n\r\n8 Sounds Banks:\r\n\r\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \r\nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \r\nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \r\nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\r\n\r\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \r\npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \r\nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\r\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\r\n\r\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\r\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\r\n8 active sound banks.\r\n\r\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\r\n\r\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \r\nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \r\naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \r\n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders.

    "descriptionHTML":"Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.<br><br>8 Sounds Banks:<br><br>The audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . <br>Using Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied <br>other filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an <br>environment suitable for spirit communication.<br><br>The audio itself is made up of phonemes, <br>partial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help <br>spirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.<br>there are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.<br><br>These sounds banks play in a similar<br>way to that of my other app &quot;Spiritus Ghost Box&quot; but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has<br>8 active sound banks.<br><br>White Noise Sound Bank:<br><br>This app also has an optional 9th sound bank called &quot;White noise&quot;. <br>This bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This <br>audio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the <br>&quot;Holy Grail&quot; of EVP recorders.

      "I honestly thought it was going to be prerecorded junk, but I've used it twice and both times was crazy. I'm sitting in my late grandmother's chair, and the 1st time I used it it said Elsie, which is her name! The second time it said Dolly, which is my name. My daughter asked me how I got the app, I told her I downloaded it for a fee. Immediately is said as clear as day \"ten bucks\" ...okay, I'm convinced! I didn't believe a phone app could be real.",
      "This app is amazing! I have gotten so many good responses! I've tried so many other apps, this one is the real deal! I spoke to my mom. I know it was her because she said her last name, not once but twice! And just so that I knew I was actually talking to spirits, I asked what color shirt I wearing. They replied with purple! I highly recomend this app to everyone that is in the paranormal field! I'm just starting out, but I've also been learning about it since I was seven. After my mom's death.",
      "I have listened both in regular mode and in airplane mode. There are a myriad of blips, diphthongs, blurbs, vowel sounds, random words both forward and reverse, and other random sounds that are pre-recorded. I get better results from an EVP of an old-fashioned recorder or video. I've been communicating with and recording ghosts my whole life. I have thousands of hours of recordings of EVPs and other phenomena. What a waste of $$$! $10 doesn't even give you the option to record ... .",
      "seems like a fun novelty but i don't think this is actually communicating with spirits. i started the app and didn't say a word. it sounded like a bunch of voices trying to talk to each other with bad reception.. i listened for about 30 minutes before saying something.. it repeats the same words no matter if you ask a question or stay silent. it's a fun superstitious novelty app.",
      "I just purchased it once I pushed start omg it's like I have millions of people here I come from a gifted family on my mom side I've been able to hear see thing since I was 7. I'm gonna keep testing it out and see what happens. Plus I keep hearing the name Dean the only dean I know is from supernatural (my hubby) idk if that's what they ment but I'll try and keep posted"

      "Overall this app is good but I have encountered two problems. 1. It doesn't let me save on my SDcard. 2. it always has a music player on, on the notification bar and it is very annoying, you can't swipe to remove it even when music is turned off and there is no option to turn it off in settings.",
      "Ever since I got a note 10+ 5g the download speeds are more that horrible. Keeps using loads of data yet no download progress. Tried contacting support. All they told me to do was clear cache and reinstall which I had already told them I'd done. Now, they won't answer me and have given no more help. Embarrassing. And I paid. SMH",
      "It's really good. I thought of purchasing it for a while and now when I did, I clearly see the difference. For as low as 250 INR this pro version is far far better and fast than the normal version. Plus the speed is stable which is a plus point as every other free torrent downloaders has speed fluctuation problems which I didn't experience when I downloaded two movies today.",
      "I was having problems wiyh it so I uninstalled it so I could reinstall and have been unable to get the download to work for several days. Found out that the history in Google Play had to be cleared. Utorrent was not the problem. Zpp works fine.",
      "Like the app however... it keeps opening itself seemingly randomly while phone is idle. No torrents loaded, etc. So yeah... not a fan of that. Works great if someone were trying to catch you doing something with your vpn off. Mine isn't used for that though so not going to work."

You could add one or two houses to this game, because where do the characters go after their vacations? Also, you could add a waterpark too.

      "It could be the best such type app, but it doesn't seem to do what promised. Owned it for 10 days and absolutely no updates. All backgrounds remains the same and if you want something new, you have to buy VIP. However, even if you do have VIP that doesn't guarantee good quality background, as I personally found them pretty dull.",
      "Love it so far at a glance all of the wallpapers are functional and good on the eyes! The app has a simple interface too so I'm not digging around looking for how to find what I have saved. The only suggestion I have is a one time payment for VIP instead of pay by month. I understand money and all that, but I feel more people including myself would be more inclined to purchase VIP then. 👍",
      "Lovely looking wallpapers. Animate real good when tilting phone. My only gripe is I paid 2.99 to find out there a vip section that cost 1.49 a month subscription. If I had known I wouldn't have bought. I expect updates for free! Why pay for app when there's subscription too. Bit if a catch",
      "Great \"live\" wallpapers, plenty to choose from, all for free. VIP backgrounds available for a fee; haven't tried them. Many backgrounds suit a male audience (scantily clad young ladies, sports cars), hope to see more lady-oriented backgrounds soon. Still plenty of gender-neutral themes to choose from. 👍",
      "At first 3ed layer wasnt showing but I got it to work after reatarting phone a couple times....is there a way to resize photo or png from my files, when adding they are huge and cant resize it, which kills the other 2 layers..other than that I love it!!"

      "once upon a time it worked really perfectly but idk what went wrong nowadays i experience lots of framskips and sometime even it stopped streaming entirely i'm using same phone since i started used these app but nowadays its terrible i even cut fps to 15 and reduce screen resolution but nothing fixed something not quite right wit these app....and i'm using pro version wasted my money....",
      "Hi Pavel, i get no audio on a Samsung Galaxy Camera. Tested different settings and i use the vlc player, latest update. Viedo is working very well but yeah the sound is missing. Can i do something to test? A hint for me? I would give 5 Stars with sound. For now 3 because the missing sound.",
      "First off, this is without a doubt the best IP Streaming app for Android, which is why I happily purchased the Pro version. I finally got it connecting to my HikVision NVR, but the catch is it only works with the front camera as the NVR won't allow a camera number below 1. Not sure if there's any way to make the app able to renumber the cameras, but if so it's an idea for a future release. Either way, I highly recommend this app!",
      "This is a really great app.",
      "Working great on 2012 Galaxy Nexus with TinyCam Monitor (pro) at the watching end. I'd like to be able to export my settings to a file. Update: Also working well (better maybe) with dated Acer S57 Liquid Jade Z. The trick was getting H264 hardware encoding working right. It took a lot of trial and error on both this and the monitor, TinyCam Monitor. Have gone pro to support development. Awesome!"

Luckily i have programmed before so i got it.... eventually. Please make a complete and accurate website guide for all functions. NOT WIKI!",

      "The alert portion is pretty good, but it all depends on your service provider. Other than that it's a great application 👍🏼",
      "UPDATE: It gives great info, but the notifications are the most important to me. I'm in Puerto Rico (we had more than 1,000 aftershocks), I need an app that's reliable. It worked fine at first, but then it stopped the notifications or gave them too late, did all the steps and nothing. Then I checked and it needed an update. Works better now. But it didn't notified it needed an update. I recommend an alert when the app needs an update so it's always functional. FYI it's faster on iPhone 🤷‍♀️.",
      "Thanks for all the help this provide to the mental health of the people of PR (at least mine). Would love to see an option to search by my current GPS option and certain ranges. I know there's a region option but would like more closer. After that is done this thing would be easier to archive but have some kind of graphic to show (based on the info of GPS and range) how they have progressed by date and scale.",
      "I tried more than 5 Earthquake alert apps and this one is the best. The fastest and most reliable of all. Others take way longer to report earthquakes and they don't report as many as this app. Been using the free version for a week or so to keep track of what happens in Puerto Rico and decided to get the Pro version to support the developer for his hard work. I encourage you to do the same!"

      "I've tried a lot of paid icon packs, and I can confidently attest that LineX is among the best. Besides dripping with style, it has an excellent breadth of coverage. New apps, like the GitHub app, get supported remarkably quickly. I particularly like how Reddit Sync has a different icon from the default Reddit app. Sometimes apps will not be recognized but will actually have icons, like with Canvas Student and Blokada. Make sure to check manually in these cases.",

      "😮 Almost all of my apps was in there!! Also, if there was no icon update in some applications they reduced in size to fit in a circle out outline, nice. This app is amazing!~ I don't regret purchasing this app ^_^",
      "Changed my mind. I like your icon pack. It got confused with one similar that I didn't own. It had ads in places where they shouldn't be. Yours is good. Thank You.",
      "I really love the colors used on these icons, looke great on OLED displays - makes the colors vibrant but not too strong."

Now, MX Player can properly queue the media files while using 3rd party apps.<br><br>This release also brings a set of upgrades to MX Share, like Share History, Invite and a few more. Go on, give it a spin!<br><br>We have also fixed some of the bugs that were bothering you a lot.<br>-Soft Keyboard will appear properly while using the subtitle search option on TV devices.<br>-Improved subtitle search functionality.<br>-LockMode now keeps the display aspect ratio intact.",

      "Been using this MX Player in my car from a Galaxy S5 Phone (Android 6) via Bluetooth with an after market BT Device so I can answer calls and play Music from Phone via MX Player Pro. Everything was excellent until about two MX Pro App updates ago, then it all changed. I can no longer use BT Adapter to Skip to next Audio Track or File, it is unresponsive to any BT Adapter inputs. I can BT Adapter play my Audio files via MX Player Pro OK but Only in alphabetical order, No BT Adapter skipping to the next track and No reverse to previous track (file) will work. I have not changed any Settings in phone or MX Player Pro App from when it was working perfectly. So can you please look at this and re-instate whatever you removed or corrupted. Or can you please tell me what if any Settings in App or Phone must be actiond. I can not give anymore than 1 star until resolved.",
      "For this update: I guess this is where shovel-ware starts. It was nice, clean and fast player. With this update they are adding social integration. I guess i will stop updating this app and hope nothing breaks, because then i will have to look for alternatives. It was a good run while it lasted. Edit in response to the devs comment: I understand that its evolving, however powerful video player does not need those options. I still think this app is heading in a bad direction.",
      "It's a great app Does pretty much everything but prefer not to see ads in the way when stopping film with a double tap. (Theres always someone reading a text or letter in a movie essential to the plotline, but too small to read). The panning and zooming is another essential feature, but if you upgrade you have to uninstall and reinstall the pro version, then have to go through all the settings again to re set preferences, theres quite a few... this is the only negative, otherwise it's the best",
      "No way to adjust network cache. If your experiencing constant buffer or videos stopping completely switch to androids internal exo player or vlc with a high network buffer. My one star is because this is old news(YEARS)... And i forgot until i started traveling with weaker signal and slower internet than in the city, where the buffer plays a major role in smooth streaming experience.",
      "I want to draw an attention to the developers that they have not added video, music and other tabs in the pro player. We have paid for the pro player and yet we don't get all this things. However in the ad version which is free the users gets all the tabs of videos and all MX originals and other content. Can you tell me why is it that way. And if we are not going to get it in the pro version please refund the pro membership fee."

      "Not completely comprehensive yet but still really nice. I wish I could search some things in reverse of the way they're listed (ex: see who likes Spring Onion, or if it's in a bundle, or how much it sells for by reading that page, vs reading everyone's loves/likes, bundle pages, etc.) -- it does link to the appropriate Wiki pages though which is a nice touch while the rest of the data hopefully gets input/sorted. But! It's still super useful. Totally worth the price.",
      "It would be really nice if there was a rarecrow checklist, recipe checklist & if more info was given. Such as about the ponds or mines, different areas, monsters you may encounter and events. Otherwise, I feel as though it's really handy to have and it's worth the money.",
      "It's a good app, but there are many things that need fixing. The calendar looks super boring compared to all the other tabs, no icons for the items recommended, or links to the said item including the info about it. I'm basically saying it feels dull to read and look at. And there's a search bar to search for information on items, but there's literally no information and just a link to the wiki. If it weren't for those things, this app would be the best Stardew Valley assistant on here.",
      "I love this app. It is so incredibly helpful when trying to schedule my day in game! I do recommend adding an \"Enemies\" tab in the search section. You could break down the levels they belong in the mines and the possible loot they could drop as well!",
      "A great little planner app for SV. I downloaded a couple of others and this one is definitely the best. It's 100% worth paying for. I like the clean interface and neatly organized info about people/items. Some reviewers complained about the way that certain items don't have full info and only offer a link to the wiki, but I haven't minded that. I'm just having patience and hoping the dev integrates more information through updates."

I love the concept of this app but considering I have not been able to get it o to work at all and the developer has not gotten back to me I definitely cannot recommend. If this was a free app I would totally understand, but for 10$ I think their should be some level of support.",
      "My initial view was that this was a terrific app. The developer was responsive when I had trouble with a wired connection and assisted with instructions to install the correct driver. But after the app was updated recently, it stopped working. It connects OK but then hangs (Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and Windows 10).",
      "Wanted to extend display of my work Windows computer to my personal Chromebook. I had to do a lot of fiddling back and forth between the two to get anything to show up on Chromebook for more than a second. Once I finally got it working, I was able to adjust resolution to a useful spot, but the laaagggggg makes it unusable for anything that isn't static. I can't imagine doing anything other than reading with it. I gave up.",
      "Was less than simple to set up / stress test on day one, but I accept that. Unfortunately on day two the app hangs in 'connecting' forever, though PC showes a new monitor as attaching. Galaxy Note 10+",
      "I really like the app. I'm using WiFi connect to a pixel slate. Duet is much better than splashtop streamer, which I was using before. And duets compatibility with Microsoft's garage's mouses without borders is great. I'm using a 4 monitor setup and it's amazing for productivity. Windows laptop with wireless mouse as input device and primary screen, pixel slate with Duet as second screen on first machine; Windows Surface (no keyboard or mouse) as Second Machine with WiFi connection to Samsung smart TV as machine 2 monitor 2. It all works seemlessly. I used to use a physical KVM and windows RDP and splashtop. My new setup with Duet and mouses without bordersis so much better; the technologies are very compatible. Now I have 3 monitors with one mouse and keyboard while traveling. It's a game changer for me. I had some trouble setting up initially, the windows client had to be shut down through task managerger a few times and I had to reset my password via email and restart windows and reopen the app on Chromebook. Eventually it worked, but I had given up, and as I reached to close the chrome app, it started to work. I'm so happy it did work then otherwise I would have deleted it. I would say 4.6 stars. Make setup a little easier and get rid of a few miliseconds lag on the Chromebook running duet as extended screen in windows I would rate 5 stars. I'm deleting splashtop streamer. I'm hooked on Duet."

      "I really love the apps however it is buggy. Sometimes, it closes suddenly while I am taking notes, and that is so not convenient. I wish it supports .pptx files as well without having to convert the files into pdf first, which took so much time. Lastly, I hope there will be more customization, such as the pen types, pen size, fonts, stickers and all that. Thank you.",
      "This app is fantastic! Yes, it has a couple of bugs at the moment, but every new version of Windows has MUCH more! It already has the features that I was seeking in rival apps, like text search and bookmarking to create clickable shortcuts to different sections of longer notes - both work flawlessly. The page preview also works so much better than others. Handwriting recognition is perfect, crisp and attractively generated! Comments about losing docs dont make sense to me as it has a built in cloud backup facility. I also do not have any problems on my Samsung Tab S4 with PDF export. Little bugs I experience are: 1. Text tool; not always responsive to initiate and cannot delete after created (only empty). 2. Too many images in the document and the page swipe functionality stops working - workaround is to use page preview selection, where no problem moving between pages. In short, I have exported my notes from my previous goto note taking app and imported into this one and really enjoying using it. Oh, the simple addition of variety in notebook covers is a gorgeous touch! Would be nice to see a couple of options of plain lined paper offering different line spacing. Really looking forward to see where this app goes! Onwards and upwards! Thank you devs!!",
      "I'm giving 5 stars just because of the fact that there is a note taking app that is actually usable in android. There definately is space for many improvments, but it also means it's got potential.",
      "Sometimes the app doesnt recognise the S Pen fluently which results in weird shapes. But I love this app so much, it's worth the money. Hope there will be a stability fix soon.",
      "Five star for best handwriting note app on android. But it have something need improve. Sometime the app close suddenly. Maybe if we have a button to turn page is nice, sometime turn by swipe not working smoothly"

      "It might be ok as a study tool, but it's rather unprofessionally developed. Many of the questions and answers had grammar and spelling mistakes, and some of them relied on picture references which couldn't be reliably interpreted. Definitely not worth the price.",
      "Great app, has all the info you need to pass the test. I was able to pass on the first try with all 30 questions correct.",
      "Two questions in their practice test are flat out wrong and I knew it but answered them on the test the way practice test had them anyway and got two wrong on the actual test because this product I paid for wasnt properly gone through before release. Even the DOJ website itself isnt up to date on the laws pertaining to those two questions. That's pretty unprofessional. The question about gun buying age and what line of safety is a safety were both botched in practice test and differ from actual.",
      "Great Study Guide! Just passed my test with flying colors. Would have got 100 on my test but one question has not been updated yet. New law in California as of January 1, 2019 states you must be 21 to buy a rifle. Was 18 years of age. I'll take 29 out of 30. Thanks again. A good investment if you plan to purchase any firearms in California.",
      "Lol this test is definitely not the same as what is actually given and in fact is much harder than the test.  Still going thru it gives you a thorough knowledge to easily pass the test"

      "Most of the games you have to buy but this game is kind of fun but the garden house is plain there should be more added but I hope all of the games will be free",
      "I don't recommend this. It only runs on my phone (where I don't want it) and not on my daughter's tablet that I bought her for games. It said it was compatible with all my devices until AFTER I bought it, and then there was a message like, \"This might not be optimized for your device.\" What a scam. Now I have to put this stupid thing I bought for my daughter on my stupid phone and feel, you know, like I'm a stupid person.",
      "I love this game cause this app is very creative and it makes children intrest in playing and gettin creative on writing stories and creative writing i am 12 years old and still play this cause it really improved my imagination",
      "I think this game is great! I bet alot of people were so happy for you to make it free. But I have 2 things to talk about: Toca Mix and Toca Farm. So, my Galaxy Tab A (it's Samsung) can get Toca farm for free, but I don't know if Apple users can. Please don't remove that if you made it, I just wanted to mention that if Apple users need to pay 5.49 for it and us it's free, I think it's unfair. And now for Toca mix. Google Play (Samsungs have it) don't have Toca Mix yet, but I think you should get it in our stores as soon as you can! I notice that Apple gets a preview, but I think you should've gotten it for everyone. And I think you should make it free so we can connect it to Toca Town. Well, thank you for reading! I'm bringing NO hate just so you know!",
      "The very first of the Toca Life games, right here. Toca Life: Town is excellent. Well designed locations. Cute and fun characters. Why not give it a try? It's quite small, though. But that shouldn't stop you from exploring this well created game!"

      "Love the app and that it's more geared towards jazz musicians and repertoire. One thing I wish it had though was the ability to hear a starting pitch possibly during the count off. I'm a jazz vocalist who sings by ear and doesn't read music. That being said, I DO know a good portion of the jazz standard vocal repertoire and it would still be good to hear my starting pitch before singing. People I play with usually extend that courtesy and it would be good to have it available on the app as well!",
      "Great support when I had issues with reinstalling Ireal pro on an older samsung galaxy tab 10.1 that didn't support the latest version. And as a Microsoft WIndows nerd, I need every bit of help I can get with Android and they talked me through the process. .",
      "The professional version of iReal Pro has been an incredibly useful tool, as I'm constantly faced with situations with dynamic song lists. While I love my Real Book, it's a bit much to carry. But this app has far more than just jazz standards for me to demolish on stage. The forum search tool enables me to find additional material created by other users. The app is also a useful teaching tool, as it will play music to give me a chance to practice. Transposing to any key, and number system!",
      "I love this app. I used it to enter chords from the Rikky Rooksby songwriting book and got addicted. So I can go through the exercises in the book without my computer. It's my fav chord progression making software. I wish I could audition chords before writing them. Also more playing styles and instruments please!!!! However it does what I needed it to do. Really really enjoying it, but it is slightly flawed.",
      "Great tool with drawbacks. 'duplicate song' doesn't duplicate without an edit, when you change a groove all the instruments revert to default, can't hear a change in drum patterns unless you start over (a dumb bug...) transposing is a huge pain, can't set a new name when you share. Biggest drawback: Grooves bound to particular sets of instruments based on the developers' arbitrary tastes- can't add or change instruments - VERY BAD- that is the musician's choice, not the developer's choice."

      "This is an extremely useful tool for rural areas. Using it I was able to locate the best towers to point the Yagi antenna on my Wilson repeater at and fine-tune the aiming in real time. Before discovering this app I was basically guessing at aiming the antenna. Also when in low signal areas this allows me to position my phone for optimal reception of whatever signal I can get.",
      "Love it apart from the notification bar, the graphic stating the current connection status is fantastic but I have to turn it off because there is no way to separate that graphic from the intrusive overlayed notification that shows at the same time. Such a shame as would be near perfect otherwise.",
      "The pro version has worked good for me we live in a spot with hill all around so we have 1 carrier that we can get any type of service. Phone is not to bad but data if you can get 2 bars of 2.5/3 G your doing good it usually at -105 but fluxes + or -10 DBM. So we pickup a signal amp & ant but in our situation finding the direction of the outside ant proved to be a problem signal direction each time or 2 phone were different. So I started using it when we went driving and found a slim opening.",
      "Having trouble to get reports for 2 sim cards. Although raw data and gauge tab show this reading,, saved report has data for SIM1 only. Dual SIM in settings is enable. Occasionally after several phone reboot it showed report for both SIMs and then stopped again until next reboot. It is really annoying",
      "I really like this app. I wish it explained some of lingo and terminology and it would also be great if there was a way to choose what cell tower you were on, I know that there's nothing the developers can do about that. Lol🤔"

      "It is good and I played it since I was five It has horses and stores your horse can be in a race with another horses. There's a forest. There's something cool and a surprise in the Water fontin ☺🏇",
      "This game is soooooooooooooooooooo nice👍 I have spent 25 bucks on it 💸💸I love it so much and I love pretend play games😀 so one day I saw toca boca and I was like yes😉❤. But there is one question how do you take a video please let me know🎬🎥. But one more thing make some of the things for free because some people want to buy games but they don't have the money anyway💶☝ I love toca boca you guys made this game GOATED amazing job😆. And ignore the haters I love toca.💜💛💚💙❤💟👏👏👏",
      "Very educational for children that are wanting to work in a stable! Good job, Toca Boca. The graphics are perfect, but I recommend to stop making apps with purchases. Because just for a game? But not disappointed pals! Good job! Five stars for ya!",
      "I love this game, but there is a glitch. One of the characters, well, you'd think he'd have legs, but, they're invisible, or, otherwise, he has none. I know you put them in in Toca Life: World, but, I wish you did it in the original. Anyways, I love the Toca Life series, and I'm a big fan of it. Keep making new locations for Toca Life: World!",
      "😱😀 How do I start saying this-- THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING!! I have always been a fan of these games they are so cute and I can always make great stories!!😀It would be great though if people could interact with others like one on one and maybe even have actual horse competitions to go to where they could compete against other players ! Other than that the game is lovely keep up your great work.❤❤❤"

      "I used to love this app, but the smart alarms just stopped working. It no longer cares what stage of sleep I'm in. It just wakes me up at the precise alarm time. If I wanted an alarm like that, I'd use the built in ones. I reported the problem, but the response was just a canned reply pointing me at the documentation. Thanks, but I've already tried that. Such a shame.",
      "Like it, but backups are broken. When importing data on a new phone, the alarms are not restored. You would think the backup and restore feature would back up and restore. Edit: A: I had followed the developers instructions and it still failed. B: if there are special instructions like that needed to make sure basic things like backups work, maybe include them in the app?",
      "I have some suggestions that may work: - Graphs. A lot of users are complaining about the oversight. How about dynamic grid lines that auto-adjust according to zoom and screen size? The y-axes of the graphs are great. I would add a colour change on each threshold: Awake/REM/Deep The x-axes need work: smaller increments (15min instead of 30) or let the user decide. I find the home screen great. More tiles would be awesome, but the question is of course what to put on them. Curse 500 chars, lol",
      "I've never paid for an app in my whole life until I found this. The free trial was fantastic. I knew what I was about to pay for. It's interesting to keep track of sleep patterns and I always have a giggle when listening to what I'm sleep talking about 🙄🤣👌 Worth every cent in my opinion",
      "I like this app, most importantly the smart alarm feature which I really think has helped me feel less tired since I started using it about 3 years ago. The one thing that annoys me is that it's not compatible with the Philips Hue Bluetooth app, meaning to get my light to automatically turn on when I wake up, I have to buy a Hue Bridge - annoying when I only own the one smart bulb!"

      "The best network analyzer app I have used to date. Does everything I need it to. I just upgraded my S9+ to Android 10 and after reading numerous comments about NAP not working, was very happy to find it all working perfectly. I still have IPV6/MAC addresses and everything works as it did on Android 9. I'm not sure if others are having problems simply as permissions have not been set correctly, or similar?? Or has Android 10 been updated in the past week or so to allow the correct permissions? Either way, if anyone has been holding back on the A10 upgrade due previous reviews, I would recommend giving it a go. Really worthwhile! Overall, an extremely functional and useful app.",
      "This is a really great app. It's clean and well thought out, all of the tools you want just right at your fingertips. I highly recommend it since it delivers such a rich depth of network information in an easy to use format. Incredible tool for a home hobbiest and professionals. My thanks to the devs, great app!",
      "This is a great app, but I am not alone in wanting to see MAC addresses in LAN scan. Its the best way to identify all devices types on the network. I guess its an android 10 thing, but I went with Android long ago because it was much more open for network tools to get information. Come on Google, work with us!",
      "Before the Android 10 update, this app was fantastic. Now nothing works: LAN scan, which I use the most, gives no MAC or vendor, and worse, you can't friendly name your things, which was part of th reason I got this. Routing table is blank; Connections is blank; all the reasons I bought and use this no longer exist. I've gone over every permission setting on my phone and this app to see if I missed something and I'm stumped. One star until someone, somewhere fixes this; I will happily give this a five when it's working again.",
      "Honestly, this app is so close to being the perfect network/wifi analyzer app. Soooooo close. But due to the tighter restrictions in Android 10, this app fails to display IPv6 and MAC addresses and the Routing Table and Connections tabs flat out do not work. Will buy again if the app gets updated, but until then, I've requested a refund."

      "NORMALCDF FUNCTION DOEA NOT WORK RIGHT. Purchased and wasted 3.99",
      "I can't stress enough how streamlined the ui is in the app. It's so much faster than the regular (150 dollar) calculator, and is in color. Tracing lines on the 2d grid is so much faster and less tedious, going through menus is so much more intuitive, and the speed of all of the calculations are lightning fast. For 4 dollars, this BETTER IN EVERY WAY calculator is an absolute steal of an app. It's like upgrading from a flip phone to a next gen phone, cheaper than the flip phone. Get it!!!!",
      "I recommend this app to all of my statistics students. So, thank you and keep up the good work! I do have a request, though. Is it possible to add a feature to change the bin size for histograms? Right now, you can zoom in and out, but doing that does not change the bin size. Thank you again for your fine work!",
      "I'm in college and this app has been amazing! No need to purchase an expensive graphing calculator - this has everything I need! People have actually commented on how I can use a touchscreen calculator - they love it too."

Neither I nor my friends or family members continue to fly the sky's so there's no longer a need for me to subscribe to the airline addition in this apps options but would opt for it as well if we all still travel the airways! It's nice to be able to tell people nearby, what's on it's way before it gets bad outside. 》\"BEST REAL TIME App\", I've ever used hands down!《",
      "Even with radar, weather is generally a gamble where I live. Riding a motorcycle for fun and as often as I can for commuting makes me a real gambler! So, having some advance warning of ~15-20 minutes is important and helpful. This app was actually recommended by a couple of people I met at a bike event and I quickly jumped to the ad free version. It works. It is generally quick to load and easy to read (even when my phone is mounted on my handlebars).",
      "I loved the free version, so i bought the full version. The ads weren't too annoying, but i just have a personal hated of ads. 😅",

      "Amazing! I used this with the lawnchair launcher and it was so amazing I actually felt like i didn't deserve it! All the colors are nice and smooth while also having the amount of detail to tell it apart from other apps. This icon pack has so many icons its astonishing. I really cant believe how well the wallpapers go with the icons! I fully support this icon pack and will look forward to more by this developer.",
      "These icons are so creative! They're so playful and colorful and go well with many wallpapers. There's a decent selection of icons and the app is fairly priced.",
      "Beautifully crafted and majority of icons are available. Masking is okay but I was able to find perfectly suitable alternative icons for the unrepresented ones. Only issue was with Evie Launcher: you have to apply individually. Still deserves 5 stars!",
      "I love the icons, and I was able to see my wallpapers initially, but now they are completely gone, despite being uninstalled and reinstalled. I need to have the wallpapers with them, otherwise it looks odd.",
      "The wallpapers cannot be applied at all on my S9+. I do not know why. If this issue doesn't get resolved soon I would much rather have the app uninstalled. At this point the money I paid seems a waste. Keeping it at a one star till I can get this fixed."

I had to keep my phone awake because if I didn't, it kept giving me errors. I selected mp3, wav, and jpg, I am also rooted, as needed. If I were you I'd avoid this app.",
      "Don't purchase this product. It'll retrieve files then ask you to download something to read them. You are forced to pay for for the pro version after waiting a longtime for the scan to finish in the free version just to get screwed out of $2.99 plus tax. I want a refund.",
      "It does find the previously deleted files, but the bit to zero out unused space is a sham. For a program that requests root, it sure doesn't do much. You're better off manually* clearing cache of every application you use. Was only $3*, I guess.",
      "Given I had to be a dumbass who formatted my SD card many times AND had to save a random picture just to see if it got corrupted (it didn't). I think I lost everything that I used to have in the card given how the simple scan won't let me see pictures other than the one I saved (which I think it means everything's lost and there's no need to root), so I guess this means it should be able to work for those who know how to root their devices AND didn't commit a similar thing I did. 5/5 I guess☺🔫",

      "The app is a good idea and it looks great, but the only way I was able to get it to work was for my friend to have the app open and the screen on which takes away from the surprise. I'm not sure if it's possible to have the app active whilst the phone is off or whilst they are on another app, if it is can I be told how?",
      "I bought the premium ( this app) only to find that it only works when the other person also has the app open. This makes this app USELESS as the whole point of the app is to suprise them. But no, I have to pay for something that doesn't even work!!!",
      "It is a very good app and it doesn't have a bad design but theres one big problem, it's meant to mess with people without them knowing so make it to where they dont have to have the app installed and where you can do it with just wifi",
      "This app is fun and all but it's a little to hard to use when trying it for fun or to call someone as a funny prank. The only way you can call someone(besides yourself is for them to have the app and have the sane electronic) it would be nice if you could add the feature up call people without them having the app, like WiFi if they are connected to the sane WiFi as you, you would be able to call them. And if you don't have a tablet with the sane brand it's annoying tbh"

It used to be a good app. but now it's not worth it to pay a dime for the PRO version as more and more reviews are complaining for the same issues.",

    "title":"SkySafari 6 Pro",
    "description":"SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience. It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\r\n\r\nHere's what's new in version 6:\r\n\r\n1) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\r\n\r\n2) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\r\n\r\n3) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\r\n\r\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\r\n\r\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\r\n\r\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\r\n\r\n7) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\r\n\r\n8) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more.  Finally, you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\r\n\r\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\r\n\r\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\r\n\r\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\r\n\r\n• Night Vision.\r\n\r\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\r\n\r\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\r\n\r\n• Much more!",

      "For any observer of the night sky, I would highly recommend this software for all your astronomy observing needs, hands down. I have been using every version of Sky Safari pro since SSP3. Just upgraded from SSP5 to SSP6, and I have to say I like the additional features in version 6, as well as the updated object data base, stars, and the planets, moons, and other minor solar system objects. Very accurate, high precision piece of software that is very super handy to use during observing sessions.",
      "Great program. Very detailed. I have a bluetooth adapter that allows me to connect to my meade lx200 classic telescope. Once aligned just click on any part of the sky and the telescope goes to it.",
      "Very comprehensive so far. Haven't had any issues yet!",
      "Love it great planning app. Work really good for finding objects to observe. Must have tool",

      "Very convenient. I have a huge monitor connected to my mac. I like to sit from a distance on the bed and watch shows.

      "Makes everything more comfortable. I set up a home theater and standing up for everything is annoying if you just want to relax after work. Now I can just control everything trough here, no lags, no bugs. It's totally worth the money. You can control so many things like media (volume, skip, pause etc.), browse, see your pc monitor on your phone, turn on/off, sleep, hibernation, wake on lan, restart, shut down, keyboard functionality, mouse (through touchscreen or joystick), etc. I could go on",
      "Set a password for the usage of this app if you want to use it ! Works really damn well, I expected something like this to be way more rough around the edges. But I find it kinda concerning, that the default setup of this app never tells you to set up a password, anyone could probably access your pc if you dont set one. (Havent tried this too extensively though)",
      "Poor experience was using the free version for a long time NO issues as soon as i downloaded the paid version: constant crashes (even after a supposed bug fix), connection drops all the time, it even frequently forgets the server its connected too.... I wish i could get a refund, used and strugled with this buggy version for over a week now, uninstalling and going back to the free version, would not reccomend paying for this.",
      "App is ok but has very frustrating controls that cannot be disabled and always show up as a notification. The only way to dismiss the notification is to open the app and tell it to close. You have to do this every time, you can just quit the app, you have to open the app and tell it to close. If the app freezes (which happens semi regular) you cannot get the notifications to go away. Opening the app will freeze and you have to restart your device. Stay away from the very invasive app."

Also I wish they would remove the annoying add on that goes on top of the system keyboard when we attempt to type. It blocks us from seeing what we are typing and makes any typing within puffin very annoying. Been complaining for months.",
      "I was using Puffin free version for a long time to play flash games and now that you can't play on the free version I decided to go ahead and pay for this one and guess what ? Still can't access the flash theater to play so will be deleting both versions! !",
      "Really like this app wish they would allow us more customization options over the virtual gamepad ,such as transparency options and additional buttons, if that was possible would be top notch.I mostly use puffin to play my favorite flash games on my phone and I hope they don't neglect any opportunities to improve upon it",
      "STILL can't use flash properly. What's the deal? Why does it keep snagging like that? I paid for this app and expect to be able to use it normally. The thing you tout as your best feature doesn't work properly.",

      "Simply one of the best file/junk apps money can buy. SD Maid feels like your phone is rooted when it isn't. It has the ability to search for and view files you had no idea existed, then you can clean them off your phone! Simple to use with no flashy animation that fools people into thinking the app is performing miracles. It simply does the job it says it doing. If could add any feedback I guess I wish the developers would add a few more optimization options like a battery saver.",
      "EDIT on update 4.4.1.... NOW IS EVEN SLOWER.....Please, what is happening? Since three days ago, I had android 9 on my Huawei Smart P 2019, and SD Paid Pro worked flawlessly. But since 1st March, when I've got android 10, if you believe me, cleaning apps in App Cleaner function is working sooo slow. 45 apps now was cleaned after 18 minutes. 😢 Before 1st March, it would be cleaned in a matter of minute. Please, could you check why SD Maid Pro is acting like this on android 10? Thanks in advance",
      "Great app for managing files and cache on phone, it was totally worth the money",
      "Great App. Still outshines everything else with regard to cleanup. Good job guys.",

The tests are helpful, as far as they go, but the real value here is the community contributed explanations of the questions and answers. As someone that is very far removed from his Elmer, this was utterly invaluable.",
      "This app is great. I'm studying for my general, and love that this app allows focused element study, and metrics on performance. I chose a single element and studied until I got my percentage above 82%, and then moved on to the next element. Very helpful app!",
      "Great app! Went from zero knowledge of ham radio, to easily passing the Technician exam in only a few weeks. The app does a great job of reviewing the exam questions, while also explaining the answers. This app has taught me a lot. Will continue to use it for the General exam. Well worth the price!",
      "Decided I wanted to go for my license. Found this app; had great reviews and app is very well designed. Utilizing just the app, in a two week period, I was able to cram enough information into my brain to pull a hat trick and passed all three tests at once. I am now an Extra and I thank this app!"

      "It's quite good for finding boats if you know the name. However it keeps freezing particularly in the gallery section. Also I cannot find the ability to add any more vessels to my fleets. So I can't find friends yachts again easily. Used to like it better after a friend recommended it. Now it seems awkward. I'm wondering if there is a better app out there.",
      "Usually a great app, but ever since last update it seems to freeze fairly regularly, I'll close it down and every time I go back on its still at where it froze, only fix is to uninstall and reinstall, phone is huawei P20 and software up to date, so suspect it is an app issue and not a phone one, very annoying. Link you sent in your reply does not work so can't provide more feedback.",
      "Hi everyone, our son works onboard Ovation of the Seas, Royal Caribbean cruise ship, which is presently sailing out from Sydney, Australia... I love this app because it allows me to see where the ship is and of course, it's position... As a lot of you will have made the connection to the horrific events at White Island, New Zealand, where some passengers lost their lives and some were very seriously injured, this app allowed me to monitor this incident until Ovation sailed out of Tauranga.",
      "I paid for this app 2 years ago, now it wants more money. I opted for the paid version of this app. And regularly use it to follow Fishing boats that I occasionally work on just to see what they are up to. Today. I login. to check on one of the boats And its location was last updated 2 days ago. It says if I want to see a more recent location, I have to spend more money. Not cool.",
      "Seem to be having more trouble with the app. My boat stopped showing up as well as most boats in our area that all have working ais days ago and haven't popped up again since. When people track me when I am on the move they say that it takes almost 24 hours to refresh my position and thats in very busy South Florida. Whats up? Used this for years with no issues."

At first I just put it down to me learning to use it. Now I'm seeing, on a fairly regular basis shots going well off, into the sand, rough etc...I look back at reply, confirm everything is in order, exact rings, hit perfect etc...starting to lose faith in this, ....so be warned. Please have a look at this, and update...",
      "Anyone having an issue with this app crashing? Check all your apps and uninstall the ones that don't work or don't need. Worked for me. Just played 3 holes with no crash. It also helped Golf Clash run smooth for once. Ya, I was shocked too. Android 10 is more strict on permissions. There is likely some other poorly written app being blocked by something it's not supposed to be doing that is causing issues.",
      "I was using the wind ring charts I created from the GC Notebook website and thought it time to pay back and hopefully bring my game to the next level by downloading the app. During the learning curve I have the grid lines turned off, and I'm not using the slider feature. This keeps things a little simpler for me and I'm not as pressed for time as I thought I would be. I wanted to thank Zachary and the Dev's for all of there hard work with this very useful app!",
      "This app is the best. Download it, do not waste your time with charts. If you play golf clash and want to be competitive, this app is a MUST. Using the widget in game to get wind adjustments is very intuitive, basically no learning curve. Seriously, this app is amazing.",
      "This is an absolute must app if you are serious about your golf clash addiction! Wow, I was printing out wind sheets before finding this! NO longer gotta do that with this bad boy! Wind assist has been 100% accurate for me. Thank you dev for making and updating this app!"

      "This is the best game ever I don't care about the price it's 100% 3 inside it so amazing I can go on my skateboard and do some food and go to bed now after school",
      "Well--you did it again, Toca Boca. But, what's there not to like about this game?The characters are fun, new, crazy and cool. Chill out in your apartment if you like--but there's lot to do! Mix beats-- or dance instead! Well--if that's not your type, you can play sports! Still no? You can go skating. Not that? No need to go far, you can paint here too! Well... if you've rejected all those you can get a snack... Or maybe you should stay in your apartment and chill.",
      "Amazing game, Toca Boca! So glad! I don't even think that there should be more levels because in most of the levels, there are four rooms! If you were to add in another level in a future update, maybe you could add in a clinic for injured students, empty classrooms, etc. Thank you 🙃",
      "Wow, amazing. Absolutely great game. Intriguing for kids of all ages. Lovely things to do like make music, score a goal, paint a picture, eat a salad, do a skateboard trick, play a arcade game and so much more. One of the best games yet. Can't wait to play toca life neighbourhood.",
      "awesome game . I love it . the only reason why I did not give it five stars is because it won't come up on my toca life world .😭 all of my other games have AKA neighbourhood school hospital pets and office. please can you fix this issue Toca Boca . also I don't think it is fair that this is for ages 6 to 8 . I am ten and adore these games ."

      "almost great app! i get random pops and gliches no what what i do, even with three different sound cards! UPDATE!...I just tested the app with my Roland studio capture and, it worked! No more popping and glitches! Thanks for the update! Yeah!👊🏽😡👍🏾",
      "Had this app for 2 years plus and things were considerably well until last night. I pulled it up for the 1st time in months and I kept getting a validation error. I have already restarted the phone and uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Still no success. Not to mention I lost saved projects in the process. 😔",
      "Running AEM on a Samsung J7 with a Roland Go Mixer and their USB Driver. Have issues with USB Audio after reloading a project - chatter, speed-up, (changing bus speed and rebooting usually clears thisb), and track bleed. Getting better at editing but the cell interface is tedious. Not their fault, just physically small, no mouse. Manual is ...not comprehensive. I'm glad I got it, but spent more time messing with it or emailing Davy than playing. In all fairness, a great DAW, I'm inexperienced.",
      "I generally prefer not using my phone for any music projects but when I do I've found this app to be the most flexible, most user friendly and most enjoyable of the many many I've tried. Very reasonably priced to boot.",
      "Hey guys, this app is solid. But I'm having some issues enough saving songs. I've saved multiple times, throwing in some \"save as\" as well, but it doesn't actually save. I've lost dozens of tracks. Just want to let you know, cause my experience otherwise is pretty dope. Thanks."

      "Ok, so I needed to store my documents on an SD card, therefore I had to purchase the premium version. $7.99AUD, not a lot but when you expect the premium version to be better than the normal free one and it's worse, per sé, useless, I get a wee bit ticked off. The dozen or so documents I had scanned on the free version have disappeared without a trace. I'm hoping for a refund but the money has probably disappeared too. DON'T BUY IT.",
      "The app worked great for a while and then became faulty after use of more than a month. The issues: the app would switch off at random points. The screen would go black. Now it is not uploading the JPEGs I am taking to my Onedrive. It just says Simple Scanner Pro is running. I would suggest using an app that is a bit more reliable as taking photos is essential for my work as an archivist and I spend just as much time trying to get the app to work as I do researching and documenting!",
      "Nice easy app to use that does what it says it should. It has been very useful both personally and professionally. Just one thing to say about the current version, the way in which you're able to adjust the scan area after you take a photograph is better than previously as it is more accurate but the older and slightly less accurate way was a lot quicker. I think mostly that quicker is better than more accurate. Could we have the option to use either? Maybe we already do and I didn't notice.",
      "Clean and easy to use, does all what one expects it to do. Automatic detection of the document border in the picture is slighty off, by only a few pixels, but that is only a minor annoyance. Will never look back to camscanner, ever.",
      "App is easy enough to use. But I paid to upgrade to pro in order to fax. Now I have to pay more money for coins to fax. Doesn't make much sense to me...."

      "This app has so much helpful material in it I don't even know where to start. The negative ratings you see are from people who probably don't even give it a chance, or refuse to learn. Yes there's a big learning curve to truly appreciate this app, but thankfully the app and website associated with it has a \"how-to\" video on literally everything you need to know!",
      "Tries to be all things to all people and as a result is needlessly complicated. It also suffers from the same fault as TPE - no offline maps, no ability to download a sector so you cannot use the terrain maps when out of range of a cell tower. Last but not least, that blue layer superimposed on the map after sunset achieves nothing other than reduce readability. It is plain clear that the sun is down from many other indicators, don't be too fancy. Too bad I missed my Play Store refund window.",
      "I've owned PhotoPills for a week, and have been trying to learn to use it, (at the moment I'm going through the star trails section of the user guide,) but the video tutorials, and the user guide itself, are so annoyingly made that I'm about to give up. The same points are repeated over and over again, and the steps are given so painfully slowly, as if the reader/viewer is presumed to be mentally challenged. At this point I wish I'd spent my money on Planit Pro.",
      "Outstanding all in one app. I've used it for a while now and have never found it wanting. Fantastic video instruction and an easy to follow user guide mean you'll never be frustrated trying to use it. I've bought both the android for my phone, and apple for the ipad. Worth every penny.",
      "An astonishing, invaluable resource. The app itself is incredibly useful and the Photopills tutorials (written and video) are replete with accurate, expert information yet are accessible by readers of all skill levels - and are crafted in an unmistakably friendly and encouraging style. Simply outstanding."

      "A great app that helps me out when I'm doing astrophotography. Really easy to use (although the time stamp is very sensitive). Great pictures when zoomed in. I really prefer this over another well known star app! Updated review March 2020. I still love this app!",
      "I'm going to have to uninstall this app. It's just so frustrating, trying to go back a page is impossible. Tapping all over the screen produces no 'go back or return' symbol.",
      "Really good the add-ons are really good not gonna lie noticed a change when I got them if you into interstellar space and stars would recommend getting",
      "Beware. I bought this primarily for 2 of its advertised features: Star Spotter, which allows you to point your phone at the sky and get a live representation of the sky which moves with the phone, and Augmented Reality where the image from your camera will be overlaid with the app-generated sky, allowing you to know what is right above you. Neither of these features is available on my device, a) because it doesn't have a built in magnetometer in the hardware - a Moto G7 play running Android 9, and b) it seems the Augmented Reality function is only available on Apple devices. However, you don't find this out until you have purchased the app and its add-ons. Should be made clear before purchase that the two key features might not work on many devices. Apart from that, there are other issues. The map of the night sky is nice and updated in real time, however, many of the stars have little or no information about them, and clicking on information will only bring up a generic script telling you what a star is: thanks, I know already. Many of the deep space objects turn out to be poor blurred images when zoomed-in on.",
      "Perfect if you are a fan of astronomy. The UI is seamless. The graphics is out of this world and very engaging. The amount of celestial bodies mentioned is mind boggling. You are search for an object in the sky where you are pointing your phone. It keeps you informed about latest astronomical events."

      "I used to use this all the time. I loved it. I guess it's me now, I can't seem to uninstall my play services under version 17.7.85, so I'm unable to install the apk. I'm kinda saddened. I know it's not this app's fault, though. When I was able to use it, it worked great and I loved it. Now I'm wanting to use it again, but either user error or my device isn't working right. Maybe I'm missing something. . . 🤔",
      "The negative reviews are by people who have no idea what they're doing. If you know exactly how to use this app to it's fullest potential, it's amazing. Works great, have had no problems with it so far. It's fast an responsive, best Fake GPS app I've used so far. Paying the $4 to get no ads is really worth it in my book. Loved it!",
      "Poco F1 latest MIUI 11.0.6 android 10 After days of studies and research, finally get it work on my rooted android 10 Poco F1. To developer, Your FAQ is kind of messy, may be you need to sort into group like rooted / non-rooted etc. For those who cant make it work for your game(PoGo) you might need to do more research about the app and your phone from XDA and YouTube. 1Q, are we able to place a mark/point/coordinate in app and WALK(NOT TELEPORT) to there from current location?",
      "App does as expected, is frequently updated and works well. FAQ is clear and well documented. Suggestion: I would like to suggest a feature to improve on a current functionality though. When you tap on the compass direction it not only resets but flips it's current direction. Example if currently south, reset to north. If currently north, switch to south.",
      "I used to use this all the time , but the new update broke it, its loads up and then closes with on 5 seconds, clear cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, but no joy , im still using older version of google play 12.... Sad times"

      "Outstanding... Very accurate ballistic calculations. I've shot out to 600 yards accurately using Strelok Pro. No advertisements. Lightning fast reply from developer. Updates new reticles regularly. Thank you Igor.",

      "Hi Igor it's David mthombeni yes!!! I am in love with this app. And all my friends have been using it all along. And I bought it last year unfortunately my scope reticle it's not in the list which is painful, cause I don't enjoy shooting any more. So Igor can u please add my scope (discovery HS 4-14x44sf FFP) or give me any advice. Frustrated."

      "I know that I keep asking you this, but you should make your games free. It's not fair on those who don't wanna waste their money on an app. If you don't consider making your apps free, maybe you could lower the prices at least. Overall, I do like the game, and there's so many pets to choose from! I think you should add character creator to all the Toca Life apps too though. What would also be great, is if you could add more locations! Maybe add more apartments? Thanks anyway Toca Boca!",
      "I had this game for 2 years and i'm still in LOVE with it!! The reason I gave it 3 stars is because there is only a few locations and I don't really think it is worth $3.99 and this game should be free but overall, its a good game!",

      "I really like this game. I do find that it doesn't have as many locations as i would want, but overall im obsessed. THANKS TOCA BOCA!!!!!!!",
      "I love all the Toca Boca games, but the ones that you pay to take forever to load! My WiFi is fine, yet this game is still not downloaded after an hour!"

      "I can't say enough good things about this. I hesitated because I am in the United States and had to work a little harder to find the foods. But the information, the reintroduction diary and the food guide have all been so helpful. I've used it for several months now and have successfully reintroduced a couple of foods and began to understand how much of another food group I can eat without discomfort. I no longer have horrible IBS symptoms! I also discovered Fody brand through them!",
      "Love it, made my life easier! I haven't been seeing a nutritionist yet, but reducing the FODMAPs I take definitely helped me a lot. I haven't reduced everything, I still have gluten, but there's a significant change in absorbing it or any other aliments I had problems with before.",
      "Bug report: The basic information is good, but the search facility does not work correctly. I can search for one thing OK, but if I try to change the search it freezes for the second search and I have to keep closing the app and re-starting for every search. This is especially frustrating when I am in a store trying to see what food I can buy and what food I can't. It makes my shopping experience rather tiresome and lengthy, which is not good for a man who cannot stand or walk for long periods. Also, is there any plan to include more food in UK?",
      "Great app but not user friendly when inputting mass bits of data. I write everything down in a notebook so I'm not on my phone all of time with work etc, and I wish you could prepopulate meals that I will have everyday or very often e.g. Porridge etc. Like it would be useful if it remembers what you've typed in before like predictive text. Also to change dates and times takes so much longer than it should, user friendliness of app could be greatly improved. But overall a very useful tool",
      "App is informative on ins/outs of the diet, including lots of recipes and journal space. On the downside, database could definitely use improvement. Lots of rare foods included, but common foods are missing. Most frustrating, is the stop light system. Some green foods, it states that green means you can have unlimited servings. Other foods, it will say in notes that it's high in something over certain amounts. Would be helpful to trust colors, without having to click through on each item."
