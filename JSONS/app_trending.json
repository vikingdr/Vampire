      "Initially, I had issues with the app crashing. I read the reviews and saw the developer's feedback that this known issue has been resolved in latest version. So I downloaded the latest version and everything works smoothly. The app has a Coronavirus assessment which is very timely and useful. Pretty cool. You can even chat with a doc. I'll start with this app next time I'm thinking about going to see a doctor.",
      "The world really needs this right now. They have a covid assessment based on Cdc.im impressed. Yeah it was buggy at first but I noticed the developers are updating this app quite often, probably attempting to fix bugs and making healthcare available to people at home. Yeah the wait times could be long but it's better than waiting at the hospital with a ton of other people not practicing social distancing. I got to chat with a doctor and it's good to have doctor advice at this time. Keep it up",
      "The app freezes my phone. It's worse than nothing! Update on 3/21/2020. At your suggestion I uninstalled and reinstalled. Same thing. I have a Samsung Galaxy S9+. It still freezes my phone immediately when I click the icon. Blue screen. Nothing else. I never get to the point where I can answer questions.",
      "As others have said I've never had an app make me so F------ mad! I've also tried every way you can imagine and can't get in. There is never a code sent. I if so where is it? This app sucks! I'll be glad to remove it.",
      "Impossible to use, this app crashes right when you get to the section that asks you questions. I've tried two different devices with the same result on each."

      "After the latest update, pressing on a classroom causes an error 'something went wrong, try again later' then I'm automatically unrolled from my class! I'm furious about this issue and it seems that many other people are getting it. It needs attention. Other than that, before the update Google classroom is great and I used it all the time to recieve assignments and post asignments",
      "Hey err... When I try log into my school account, it says \"We are sorry, but you do not have access to Classroom\" and \"Please contact your domain administrator for access\" and then it kicks me out of my school account! Weirdly though, it works through my Gmail account... I don't understand why it's saying that so please fix it! I need to work on things for school! 😭 (P. S: I'm using an Android phone)",
      "I use this app as a student. IMHO, complexity of the app is low - the task for junior developer. But even here some things aren't good. At first, menu item \"calendar\" just opens system default calendar. Silly. Secondly, there is no possibility to configure notifications. Earlier push notifications appeared the day before due date, but last week they started to show at midnight of the due date and woke me up. Big Brother decided this is convenient for all. Keep up good work. One star so far.",
      "As some people have pointed out, with one of the latest updates I can no longer access any classes or log in. The app seems to be in a Beta update... I never signed up for it... Google also hasn't fixed it yet which makes me think it isn't a serious issue for Google. Just revert the update, please!",
      "Before the February 20 2020 update it was working just fine but after installing the lastest update, it keeps removing me from my classes. I think this is an app problem because on the website version of google classroom my classes are still there. I uninstalled the app and downloaded it but now it is saying that my gmail doesn't work. I just to let you guys know that can you please update the bug, thanks."

      "Don't bother with this useless app.The app hasn't worked right since february of this year, 2020. It constantly loops to sign in, sign up. You can sign up and it loops again. I've reported it via support more than once, nothing changes. Bugs are never fixed. The managers say \"we can't do anything about it. Our customers are very upset, but we have no way to report the problem.\" Other fast food apps seem to work. What's wrong with Burger King?",
      "When I first started using this it was great. You can pay through it and not have to deal with cash. Very discounted Impossible Burgers and other deals so you don't have to carry BK coupons around. Now almost every time I open it it says Downloading Update and the update often fails. Last time I placed an order it got glitchy and said try later, so I retried and ended up getting double billed. Please simplify the app that used to work fine. Galaxy Tab A 2019 Android 9.",
      "Overall, the apps is great. The deals are worthwhile and change enough to keep coming back. My only complaints are that sauce and drink choices are incomplete as well as when ordering a deal that contains two sandwiches, the modifications to the second sandwich are not given to the staff making our food. This has happened to me every time and I have verified the modifications in my order history.",
      "Can't log in on the app. There is no option to put in username and password. It sends an email with a link to click to log in. That works great for the web app but if you click the link to open the app. Nothing. Who tries to run a script on a web page to open an app on your phone? Poor design. Just order on the web.",
      "I like the deals but the functionality is lacking. The previous app, for its failings, was at least consistent. Now I get the notice that my connection has issues, so it won't load the cart. Been this way over a week. I also miss the \"I'm here\" function that would make sure you weren't charged until you could pick up your food, and your food would be fresh. My Burger King is horribly slow, so it's nice to give them some lead time"

      "This is BS!! DON'T BELIEVE the 1 week FREE TRIAL! It's a LIE! It'll ask for your CC for \"in case you don't cancel in time\" but when you do cancel in PLENTY of time it will tell you 'NO REFUNDS' that is FALSE ADVERTISING and just plain BS in my book!! I'm FURIOUS! I was raised to believe there's nothing worse than a thief and a liar and they are BOTH!",
      "Signed up for th 7 day free trial. Cancelled the same day (so as to not forget). Charged for a full year 7 days later. Not impressed af all that the 7 day trial with the option to cancel was not true. Feeling very misled by the app. ***I have responded to your email with the required information and still have yet to receive a refund***",
      "I didn't mean to subscribe to this app. I only wanted to try the 7 day free trial and it charged me for the year. I also went to add something to food log and everytime I scanned the barcode it couldn't find it. It also doesnt have normal stuff, for example lunchables or mountain dew. Crazy!!!!",
      "I wanted to do a trial week of this app. When I signed up it only gave me the option for a yearly subscription. So I thought well, it says there is a trial week I can cancel later right,.....wrong. The trial option only applies to the monthly subscription, which I didn't get the option to choose between yearly or monthly. So now I am stuck with an app for the next year that I may not even use. Be careful before you hit subscribe. Better Me did.make things right and I did get my refund.",
      "Do NOT get this app!!! I was thought there was going to be a 7 day trial but then it charged my card for the full year. I tried to cancel realizing that it was a horrible app, but I couldn't. I emailed them and got an automated reply and it said they would get back with me within 48 hours and they did not.. This app is very misleading. I got my refund from this app. I still would not get this app"

Nothing but the same \"oops\". This isn't an Oops, especially AFTER an update meant to address these issues! I have NO way to communicate with my child's teacher especially now that he's out for 2 weeks!",
      "I have used this app for a few school years & enjoyed it but about 2 months ago it gave me an error message & stopped sending/recieving texts. I've uninstalled/reinstalled it but now I get an error message to try again to log in later. I've tried it on a different device. I've tried to request a password reset but that failed also. Is there anything else I can try?",
      "Horrible! Why fix what wasn't broken? I have used Dojo for years. I have told everyone about it. Now that you have updated it, nothing works right. Yes, I uninstalled and reinstalled. I have signed out and in. Nothing is right. If I wanted my app to spin a blue circle for hours then this would get 5 stars. I need it to work regularly as my students depend on it and this new version is erratic at best.",
      "This app is an amazing tool to keeping in contact with your kids teachers. I was having a problem with my app, deleted it, reinstalled it, and even updated it (waited for an update) and still had problems. So I emailed Class Dojo and they helped me to get it working properly again! Thanks to Rachael with customer support!!!"

I've tried many times to scan their codes but won't accept it in family app! Then when I go to the class one, it's constantly asking me to sign out then bck in again to view each child's profile! Please help me fix this problem then the rating with change! Thank you",

Also, there are times where there is no popup notifications. Under Announcements section, can consider including a function where announcements can be broadcast to all students of different classes, instead of just the class itself.",

I really love Seesaw, but I have to change my rating as the android version does not have a send back option. I have to go to my laptop. However, my wife's IOS Apple version has the sendback button. Can you please fix this?",

And also I can learn by videos without getting hard time, and also there is teachers in this app so we can watch videos, solve sheets, and do homeworks that's why I like seesaw and love it❤️.

The voice I choose reverts to one I didn't want to use. And my choice for 'update only over wifi', 'reduce music volume', and 'somewhat expressive intonation' also revert to the default settings. No response to feedback. I thought maybe it was my device or the app I was using, but I see others here have tried the same problem A sad end to such a great service."

      "I am so frustrated with this app!!! It crashes constantly. Every time I try to click a link in my email, it crashes, and sometimes the app does not open. I have been sending reports and messages for weeks now to no avail. I don't want to go through the trouble of closing my email account and go to another service, I JUST WANT YOU TO FIX THE APP!!! Hopefully, SOMEONE will see my post and are kind enough to respond!!!",
      "I use gmail all the time but I noticed on this update before last that it took away the ability to resize images, at this time when we are more isolated from each other it would be good to be able to reduce the size of pictures to share with friends and family. I used to be able to send over 10 pictures at a time and in sequence, now its max 6 and all over the place.... any chance we could have the resize element back??",
      "I love Gmail. But it never deletes my spam when I tell it to. My emails come thru late. I have to pull the screen down to make it sync. Even though I keep my account clear of old emails and constantly delete anything that I'm done reading. I'm still having problems. So I have to uninstall all updates and reinstall the app weekly. Just so it works properly for a few days.",
      "gmail now crashes no matter what fix I apply. Also...I've lost the ability to make this the default, or to default to another email app so I can open my hyperlinks. Every time I click a link it crashes and I never changed my settings. This update is the worst one ever. I'm switching everything off of Chrome, because I live and work by my email. I cannot function! And yet...ALLL of my emails are GMAIL! I want a divorce. After 3 weeks of complaints, you would think someone would get the message.",
      "Something weird has been going on with my gmail Android app for some days. It does not open. Absolutely nothing happens when I click on the App button except a totally blank white screen with only the + sign for new email on the bottom right. I have no idea what to do. Please help me, Gmail is essential for my work. Update: Fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling all updates. Leaving this review here for the record."

      "I lined up the photo with the edges of the card and it changed screens to re-enter information. Once I gave all my credit card information that it asked by auto-fill, it asked for re-entry again. I hate chancing my credit card information. Why offer a scan or auto fill that doesn't work? Frustrated by the end. If it weren't for the special, I would have hit cancel on the whole order.",
      "My experience with this app has been great every time. In fact I look forward to ordering pizza because of this app. No more being put on hold or some one not understanding my order or what I'm tryn to have done. This app makes me feel like I'm right there giving instructions to the chef because everything come out perfect and it still amazes me each time. Thank you Domino's.",
      "This app works super well. I am highly pleased. I'm able to make orders, customize them with ease, and have them deliverer/carried out with no problem. Highly recommend doing it this way, in comparison to calling the numbers. It's easier on us who order and much faster to process for those who are making the pizza as well. It's a win/win.",
      "I love using this app!! It is quick and easy to use! Makes my fast paced lifestyle a little easier! The prices also help when you have 2 growing teenagers and a husband to feed, they eat alot so finding a place we all love at prices we can afford for the amount of food we order is amazing!! Plus never have we gotten a bad meal or bad service at this location!! Its always a win win for us!! Thank you!!",
      "Difficult. Trying to pay was horribly difficult if auto-filling the card information. It acted like it accepted the info, but would drop everything after reloading the checkout screen. Also, using coupons gave inconsistent results when ordering the $5.99 deals. It's not ok to have to troubleshoot the options and figure out what changes the prices. There are no indicators at all! This is a terrible app."

      "Connection to VPN disconnects every few minutes requiring user to relaunch the app to re-establish the connection. Very annoying when you want to continue browsing knowing the VPN will remain connected. To the best of my knowledge I have instructed my phone not to restrict the app and allow it to auto start. I have also enabled 'connect automatically' within the app itself. App also doesn't launch immediately, instead you have to look at s picture of a lighthouse?",
      "I will revise this review after I have had time to use it more and evaluate all aspects of it, but I strongly recommend using Norton antivirus and Norton Secure VPN, as well as most Norton products in general because it's been a solid, tried and true company for at least 40 years, (or as long as I've been alive.)",
      "Great for security I had the same issue others had on the trial broke down an paid for the subscription and it works totally opposite of the trial The security for transactions is completely different very secure I do not have every thing I look up follow me advertisers are not able to follow me. If you bank or use a trading platform or purchases you will see the difference. I was very skeptical. Glad I made the purchase and was able to buy a lifetime purchase norton AV for 5 devices with VPN.",
      "Update: 3/14/2020 - now no longer works at all, not able to \"set up Norton account\" can't even get into the program. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. Norton Mobile Security seems to work just fine...but this VPN app flat out doesn't work. I answer to developer comment, same problem either over my home wifi or cellular. Doesn't matter. Takes a LONG time to connect. Many times it NEVER connects. When it works, it seems to work well though...just very hit and miss.",
      "What a ridiculous and useless app. Unstable, and wouldn't connect. I assumed it was because I was using a limited version during the free trial. So then I went to cancel, which was insanely difficult and wound up being charged for something I can't use. Tryi g to request a refund from my phone on the mobile website put me into an endless loop of new tabs being opened, without ever being able to request my refund. This comes off like a scam, which is a shame considering the Norton reputation."

I just charged the fone and had 20% battery use in a very short time. Something is not right.",
      "The application is useless without the \"clean now\" option. Had to uninstall the update. Update: came back to check if they added replacements to the missing features, but they haven't. On top of that, it appears that they use paid reviewers to bump up their rating of the app, shameful and absolutely deceitful, especially for a company of this size that doesn't depend on the app for its livelihood.",
      "Dear Samsung, problem solved. I deleted the update, and got my clean and clear button back. I will not be updating that app for the duration of time I still have this phone. Furthermore, if this is to be Samsung's policy, going forward, to make things better by making them worse, this will be the last Samsung product I ever buy again!",
      "theres a problem with this update,the storage clean now button is missing and the storage doesnt get cleaned. It worked before the update. I uninstalled this update to fix that problem. Being how this isn't an app you can delete,when are you going to fix the storage cleaning option. Perhaps you should partner with ccleaner,they have the best cleaner on the market.",

Not only can you NOT Clean Now the device yourself, the widget that shows ram usage and storage is no more accurate as I am using my device. There was a comment early that said if it is not broke do not fix it. It applies to this situation. Seems to be a little bit more thorough. Not 100 percent. But it is good enough"

      "I would love to give you guys a 5-star rating for Android accessibility. I think it is an excellent application for the blind, and the best screen reading application out there for smartphones. However though, I cannot give you a 5-star rating, because your application is not being very successful with my Pandora Media application. It's not being accessible to me, because it is not reading to me where to add songs to certain playlist. Can you guys come up with a better update to fix this?e?",
      "As a tester an developer of android apps This app is the absolute foundation for many of the best qualities expidited in the Android. What works without this app works better with it. This is a must have for the Android thats opening a new an exciting new generation of inteligent applications changing there place in the world today . I'm in Awe of what must be next. Everyone watch for big changes sooner than you think. A0Sincerely (\"3rd Ghost\")",
      "Hello I am blind and using TalkBack sometimes but not often. I noticed that reading is getting delay srart compared to eloquence (third party apo). I am using eloquence since long for three languages (English, Hindi and Gujarati) and then Google also introduce these laguages but still I can't use Google for regular use because it is starting late reading.",
      "First of all. You should remove the hint that is action available. Because it's so boring for regular uses visually impaired person. Secondly I would like to tell you you must add automatically scroll list. Because we are facing many problems. This was removed in last update. And you must improve the app because it does not read unlabled buttons. Thank you for helping the blind people",
      "The UI is really ugly! Here are some suggestions, kindly work on them. -Remove the arrows from the bottom and add some dots that indicates there are other pages. -The background is excessively bright for a accessibility menu, make it transparent or blur it. That would look amazing and professional. - Make the buttons moveable similar to the notification bar"

      "Messenger recent update is bugged and I have tested it already on all 3 devices of mine, both android and iOS. Whenever I am trying to share something through messenger (be it a YouTube video, a photo, or an audio clip I have recorded in my phone's internal app), it will only pull up the Messenger app as if I am not sharing anything!!",
      "messenger sucks anymore.....have not been able to share and send articles to my friends as I did before, by clicking on share, then messenger and then name used to come up and I would click send next to their name, but will not and has not done for three going on four days today and do not know why! Is there something wrong with messenger? Can you please fix this problem and asap, thanks!"

      "I'm having so much fun with this app! I'm rewatching every wrestling PPV, show, and specials from the 70's forward. I'm about to hit Summer Slam '92! This app is amazing, but I would suggest two things. 1. The buffering issues can be annoying at times. 2. I wish that you have an option to select by year, and it would give you the list of all shows, PPVs, and specials in order(wcw, wwf, ecw included). Right now I am going off a list from Reddit, but it's not always accurate.",
      "If I'm going to watch something like elimination chamber that happened yesterday when I pause / unpause it, it goes right back to the very beginning and restarts everything all over again instead of stopping and picking up where it left off if you can please fix that that would be awesome because I was not having problem with it before it would have been before the new year actually. If you could please fix these bugs, thanks a lot.",
      "Cons: The closed captions are inaccurate on scripted shows. They also censor words that aren't censored in the audio and words that have ass in their spelling. Even if you have orientation locked on your device, the screen rotates. Playback controls require double taps. Pros: Loads of content. Whatever your favorite era of wrestling, you can watch it. The price is well worth it. If the technical issues are fixed, I'd happily rate this 5 stars. I just wish the weekly shows were available sooner.",
      "The problem I'm having is it wont play the most recent ppv. It did this for super showdown as well. It kept saying \"something went wrong, no access granted\" I checked the status of my account and still says subscribed. It loads up every other show as well. Why cant I watch the elimination chamber? I just tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and I get the same message",
      "My only complaint is you cant watch weekly episodes until about 30 days after they air, which makes it almost useless because by that time you've already had what happened spoiled and you just feel like you're behind on everything. However it is a great deal since you can watch PPV events live without having to spend any extra cash, and you get a bunch of cool weekly talk shows/documentaries/etc. to watch. Definitely will keep you entertained."

      "I have been using google voice for a few years now without ANY problems but all of a sudden it stopped working. I cant make/receive calls nor send/receive text messages. I have uninstalled three times in an effort to fix the problem but it's still not working. This is causing a huge disruption for me and there seems to be no technical support.",
      "Usually great, but since the latest update, the notification on my lock screen (and thus also when I unlock) keeps disappearing. It'll show up for a few minutes, but if I don't get to it fast enough or if I don't see it right away, it just goes away. I keep needing to go into the app to make sure I haven't missed texts.",
      "I really appreciate being able to have a second number that I can keep permanently for keeping my personal phone personal. I don't want everyone calling my cellphone; close friends, family etc yes! Business contacts, retail memberships, creditors, not at all. Nothing sucks more when trying to relax than some a-hole blowing up your phone. Got to love Google for this service! @ pthis price this service cannot be beat. Thanks Google Team!! Sincerely, Moe",
      "Cant give it a 5... works great so far, definitely notifies me when I missed a call and it went to voicemail, but I want to either extend the number of \"rings\" before it goes to voicemail, OR disable the voicemail feature and review my missed calls! Either option would be good, and allow me the time to get to the phone to answer it! I am not so young that it is attached to my hand, and it seems to go to voicemail very quickly. Please advise on either option that I would like to utilize!",
      "I've been using Google voice for a while now. I really enjoy having one phone number for everything. I'm not sure if I'm imagining this but it seems like I don't get very many spam calls to my number which is super nice. The search leaves something to be desired and the chrome plugin no longer works."

      "This app could be a lot better. If you are in multiple different groups/classes, it doesn't allow you to push text notifications on which ones you want. You either get notifications via text for every single group you're in or none at all. Super annoying as I don't want nor need texts to be pushed through for every group I'm in! When you email tech about this or anything else, they're super unhelpful and won't actually address anything you asked about . Truly wish I didn't have to use this app!",
      "I use Remind for spur-of-the-moment communications with my university students. It works perfect in these kind of situations. My only complaint is that part of Remind could be geared toward college and university students. For example, the icons are clearly geared towards primary and secondary education. Unless I haven't figured out how, which could be the case, I would love it if things like the icons could be personalized or have more options that could be for college-level students.",
      "My experience with this version and the apple version were completely different. When i am typing the last few messages is hiding behind the keyboard. Not only that the app doesn't really send me reliable message notifications, yku can expand but if it's longer than the first line it won't show, it also doesn't show if they're read. Messages don't appear when the notification does. It's a very frustrating experience and I would like it if it were fixed.",
      "Its an incredibly helpful app, however it is incredibly frustrating how slow it is to send messages to teachers. Even with my own personal data, with good connection, it takes really long. I hope they fix this, or the whole purpose of communicating with teachers fast is not happening.",
      "Very great for school, but one key problem: If I were a teacher, I would want to delete old groups or messages that aren't wanted. Unfortunately, there is no way to delete messages or groups. It is great, near perfect for school communication, but I just wish there could be a way to remove conversations. Other than that, its a really great app!"

Sometimes it's a little hard to press some buttons or to open the app, but almost everything else is amazing. You can actually make playlists and are able to play them without random problems like skipping to random tracks, not being able to skip songs, or not being able to just play a single song. Though, it doesn't play offline because it gets songs from YouTube.",
      "So each time the main menu stays frozen and it says there is no intent conecton even tho I have an unlimited data plan and full bars of wifi it also won't let me look up any new songs and it is so annoying and I tried to uninstall it and reinstall it but it still won't work please fix this small issue I really like this app it's a good app to listen music on and if this gets fixed I'll probably rank it up to five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "The app is nice. Got the spotify vibe. The theme of the app is nice, it's neat. But I hope you'll develop this app into something that could let me play music while the screen is off. I'll be waiting for it, and I won't hesitate to use this app for a lifetime! In addition, it has a floating widget while there is another existing on the notification toggle, so...?",

      "This app is awesome! Even if I don't choose a specific recipe, it's great for generating ideas. Especially when it comes to not wasting food (and, therefore, money). Pick a key ingredient (what am I going to do with all this zucchini??) and a course (not another loaf of bread!) and it pops out dozens of recommendations. My only complaint is the favorites tab is not MY favorites. It's generated the same as the home page.",
      "Its easy to use. And convenient when you cannot think of something to make. The only thing i do not like is trying to add an item that the pantry does not have, for instance garbanzo beans or canned chicken. Its frustrating because I would to search for a recipe to use up my beans that is not hummus or a salad. Happy Cooking!",
      "The user should be able to add ingredients not already stored in the database since the app is using an algorithm to mine the internet for recipes it should be able to find added ingredients too. Your database doesn't have deli meats, dairy creamer, fruit pie fillings, and many other ingredients that a lot of recipes on the internet call for.",
      "It's great... in theory. But if there's a feature I'd say is missing, is being able to make a separated list for what you USUALLY have available, and what you CURRENTLY don't have/don't want to use. I might want to filter a large number of things out of the search I'm doing for my next meal, but then I'll have to manually find & add that bulk of things back into the list one by one even if they're things I would usually have no problem procuring. A \"temporary\" list would be nice for that.",
      "This app didn't have some of the basic ingredients I have on hand so I substituted semi similar ingredients. It gave me basically different ways to cook salmon, rice or to make butter but no meals utilizing any of my ingredients together, which is what I download the app for. Pretty useless for my needs. I'm deleting it momentarily. Bon appetit!"

      "Love this app, I am managing 3 acc for my children, I can set the time limit in which they can be in their android devices. And when they are grounded I can lock it tio prevent them from using their devices. I'm having a small issue though, tried to add Dad(my husband) into the family group but we're being prompted that he isn't in the same country. I even changed it to make sure they are both set up in the same country, and still won't let me add him.",
      "This is a great resource for parents and caretakers who have children with smartphones. I am able to monitor both screentime and content from my phone. My child(ren) can ask permission to download an app from their phone. If approved I can see information about time of use and stop or limit an individual app. The only thing I had trouble with was the family location. However after disabling the wi-fi( including the phone searching for wi-fi)the location service was more consistent and accurate.",
      "Tried to connect a child's account to the parent account. Got an error about 'different countries' - checked the child's account, no country has been set up - and the only way to set up a country is to add payment method (credit card) from that country. No, sorry, isn't going to happen. Users should be able to set their play store country without any payment method whatsoever, and/or in the case of setting family accounts allow different members of the same family to have different \"countries\". This is a very poor design decision. Not user friendly and quite annoying.",
      "Love this app.. you can lock devices and apps. Set time limits for apps. The only thing I DONT like is that you cant remove it from device you have to completely delete the Google account. You can however use the suspend feature and go right back to it.. but I would like to remove it without having to delete my kids account. So please fix that issue and I'll give you 5 stars...also wish it followed fir EVERY platform across the board.",
      "This is one of the worst apps I have ever used unfortunatly I have to give the app one star. It claims to give you control over the apps/websites,the ability to set schedule of when the devices can be used, to be able to lock devices and block apps. NONE of this is actually true. If you set a schedule for the devices to be shut down, the times will change or not lock at all. If you block an app or lock a device, it will unblock or unlock by itself in minutes. Complete waste of time."

      "Awful. Dont even enable fingerprint! Before you even begin it starts glitching over and over. Then logs you in and boots you out, I repeated that step 5 times before I could finally see my appointment. Went to add subscribers and then was given an alert saying that they couldnt do that at the time to try again later. Then hit back, to be booted out... wow.",
      "The UI is clunky, the controls are flakey, the notifications are not delivered reliably... but at least it worked! Now it does nothing but insist that I'm running a \"modified\" (i.e., rooted) version of Android -- which I'm NOT -- and exit right away. I'd give it 0 stars and a middle finger if I could. 🤬 Completely useless now.",
      "It's really difficult to use, their symbols are basically useless as they have almost no relationship to what they're supposed to indicate. The app always seems to vanish, if you switch momentarily to another app (like, to copy some text to insert into this app)... it's a ridiculously difficult and frustrating app to use! I spent almost 40 years designing&developing dozens of UIs for applications running on a wide array of different kinds of displays, including mobile platforms. This is awful",
      "If I could give this app a 0, I would! I tried to log in and of course it said I had the wrong information.. I reset my password and got an email to make sure my username was correct. Went through the verification code process three times and still unable to login even using easy login. I have the doctor's code but unless I can log in I can't access my information. I tried to submit a ticket and they want the name of my doctor.. and although I have the doctors code I don't have his name because it was a radiologist from a test I took. Tried to submit help and I can't get the code to change to other, it stays on forgot my password. So even if I get my ticket submitted it won't help and there is no email address where I can send information directly about this problem. I have tried to use this app before and had the same problem. It won't show both of my doctors either. This is not due to a tech savvy problem either.. Without the ability to submit the correct problem I will never be able to get this fixed",
      "Overall, this is a straightforward app used to track your medical information, contact your doctor, and remind oneself of dates and other data. I find it easily accessible! I would like to see a little bit more flexibility as far as being able to respond to communications to and from my medical providers without having to generate an entirely new communication! Thank you,"

      "I dont understand if it's a problem with my Cable or TV provider (like at&t) but I wont allow me to log in. I've tried deleting and reinstalling it, I've tried to restart my device but it still wont work. I'll give it one star due to you still being able to watch some episodes of some shows. But if the big isn't fixed then the app will not be as great as it was befor",
      "The worst streaming app I ever used. Getting to season episode lists is convoluted. It stops casting if your phone locks. Sometimes the app randomly goes away while casting, and if you open the app, it starts playing another episode of something. If someone calls you while casting you can't easily pause it, what a mess. Just terrible!!",
      "Currently there is a bug where the app will crash if you try and sign in to your cable provider, which is obviously a big problem. Some other minor issues are a UI which is poorly optimized for anything outside of 16:9 and a lack of an option to pay to remove ads, and you've got yourself a bit of a stinker honestly. This would normally deserve 3 stars but the bug is worth docking an extra one since that's major functionality.",
      "HORRIBLE! ABSOLUTE TRASH! only gives you like 2 episodes for each show. The ones that ARE unlocked are in the middle of the season! When I try to log in, the app crashes! Tried to log into it on my Roku tv, but after I completed the online activation, it still didn't log in! DONT INSTALL THIS APP! IT IS AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF STORAGE!",
      "There are pros and cons. pros: the shows are pretty fun and cool. you can't always watch them on other apps. cons: it usually malfunctions and it's REALLY frustrating. And it takes such a long time to log in! and it's confusing and annoying."

      "The lessons are good but the servers of this app are non-existent. The video keeps on buffering after every 4 or 5 seconds even though others apps work smoothly with the same network connection. The same is true for the Udemy website. It becomes frustrating after a certain time and the excitement to learn vanishes. I kept waiting for an hour to watch a 16 minute lesson and wasn't able to complete it. It was either a problem with the lesson or the Udemy server. It keeps on buffering.",
      "Works great but facing problems while playing videos and opening pdf lessons of my course at times. The videos get stuck displaying a message telling me to play the videos from my computer instead. It isn't a connectivity issue. The pdfs simply refuse to open while the ones on my phone open as usual. Moreover, this app works well only on high speed connection. When connected to the WiFi the video playback speed drastically reduces. I hope the problems get resolved soon. Thank you Udemy",
      "Hello Udemy team, I have an issue regarding the screen resolution. I cannot watch the videos in full screen body ratio. The width of the videos are fixed to certain level. And we cannot even zoom. As you can see when I play a video in YouTube. I can get Full screen display ratio. It would be better user experience. If you update it to the full screen size ratio. and also great helpful for mobile user's. Please look into it and let me know. Thank you. Kind regards.",
      "Please can someone explain why my course downloading is not effective. Each time I try to download a new course, the downloading starts from a previous course that I've already completed before. Is there any way I can correct this? However I've been enjoying the use of this App, this download issue is my only challenge. Please assist.",
      "I like the app but there are a few glitches I am facing recently. They are, 1) Even after downloading the whole course I am unable to view it when my internet is turned off or my phone is in poor network zone. 2) Recently I have bought a new course but I am unable to make the course offline, the download button does not work. Hoping to hear on a resolution soon for you. Thanks & Regards, Kevin Rodrigues"

Such a relief 🤣 I use it because my school wifi SuCkS soo badllyy and they have almost everything blocked :// Every other VPN I tried to use either wanted me to pay a ton of money or said it was \"free\" And never really worked. So yeah~~ 5/5 stars :3",
      "It's really great, especially when I'm in school I appreciate how good it works and it offers so many options or places to choose from, with the 12 month plan though it should be a little less or you should be just pay upfront and then it asks you after 12months again.",
      "It says no credit card needed or free trials but yet when you install and run the app, it immediately asks about starting a free trial and to choose a plan that charges which would require a card so they are falsely advertising their app by saying no trials or credit card needed.",
      "Worked ok on the free trial version. But when they charged me for the year, (which I had only agreed for a month) it was alot more unreliable to connect. And dropped out regularly. There is no option to cancel the account via the app and if you try to contact them directly via the app it says that it is unconyactable or address doesn't exist. so I was just out of pocket $129 without any sort of way to get it back. Will never use them again.",

      "This is my go to for writing any chapters for stories. Like it easily backs it all up so I don't have to worry about manually backing it up. It's very good with offline abilities too. Usually I have had apps crash or lag on me but this app did not do either. Quick on the go tools you can use as well as a few fonts. One small flaw and that is when I try to sometimes copy a specific section it won't let me. That has only happened to me a few time though.",
      "Great app, however when ever you switch to desktop the actual document's layout is different. The whole purpose of the app is to have it on the go and add pictures from your phone. There are no pages in the app so when you move to the desktop version the layout is different. It needs to have the desktop features like showing references and pages.",
      "Not a good app to use in android. There are a lot of cursor problems and when you click on the backspace button, the cursor moves to another line and starts deleting words. Has a lot of good templates, no doubt, but this app has to have some debugs for the problems faced by users using android.",
      "I'm using this app to write, it was great, easy to navigate through the app.. spellcheck is superior love the update, explore options while still app is a game changer, although, i wish there's night/ dark mode because i have trouble writing when the screen went to bright 🔆. overall, satisfying app",
      "Very convenient app, but a lot is missing or hard to access, such as font and spellcheck. It would be nice if you could double-tap or tap and hold a word to bring up the spellcheck instead of going into the menu each time, or if you could choose what formatting elements to have above your keyboard."

      "Very buggy. Developing pages and testing against this browser reveals all kinds of caching issues. Even after clearing the cache, the browser doesn't render things properly with missing images and text on some pages. It wouldn't even render a test page with a single img element and nothing else! Quitting the browser and restarting it makes it work properly at first, but as time progresses some elements start to disappear. Very frustrating to use and test pages against. If the devs want examples, I can provide them. Contact me.",
      "Nothing special about it. It's distracting with the surrounding irrelevant information. I don't like my time being wasted. I like efficiency. A clean page with to the point access of the tools I need. The ability to search for and find what I want at that moment, without getting bombarded with odd and ends that stop me from being productive.",
      "What was in that latest update (March 2020)? Google Play kept crashing during the install! It used to be a decent app, but someone has decided that all searches should be saved, which is annoying, the screen gets cluttered with previous searches that I don't want. Why do software writers keep removing sensible and useful features?",
      "Everyone should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, FASTER. It's actually pretty clean and efficient compared to some of the other browser choices that are available out there. You should at least give it a try, since it is designed to work best with the machine that it is installed on",
      "Everyone can visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, PRIVACY and VERY FAST. User Friendly, Reliable and Superb ! This browser has come on leaps and bounds over the last year or so. It was initially good, then they tried to fix what wasn't broken, now it's back to its old self again - only better. It's now even more reliable, nice to use and look at"

      "The mobile version of this app is frustrating. It's great when it decides to work but 95% of the time, the app wont load, when it does load and play a video, it is constantly freezing. It also will freeze and then skip back by itself and replay audio that has past and then start playing again just to freeze again. Can we please have someone look into this and actually fix it????!!!",
      "I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. The episodes. Don't play without glitches, if they play at all. One minute I can watch on my TV, the next I can't. Then there's the mobile app, which is a total loss. But what is REALLY effing annoying and weird, is that an episode is English dubbed one second, and Japanese subbed the next. And it happens, WHILE YOU'RE watching!!! I appreciate funimarion for providing fans with dub options, but the app is a disaster. And the website is even worse.",
      "App needs work. Clicking on things like \"recently add\" takes you to list that keeps refreshing when you get to the end. What looks like 100s of shows is really just the same 15 shows repeated again and again. Click on a show and going back takes you all the way to the top of the list. There is also video playback issues... forever to load, pause and can't continue. Want to go back or skip forward a few seconds, nope, video stops working. Overall just a poor UI. Also needs a night mode.",
      "This is my second review. I noticed you respond regularly to these however instead of \"talk to customer support\", \"sorry you're having a bad time.\" and shrugging off doing something about it put some effort into fixing the app or just take it down. You have all the clear consistent information you need to figure it out: laggy, freezes, slow, bad resolution ect. It's not us it's you and we would dearly love for you to fix it so we can actually enjoy the content you provide.",
      "I have this app on my phone, it's really awesome. I love it, but it won't let me subscribe even on the website, and I would like to. Sometimes when I go to a different page it's just blank, and I have to start all over. Not all the episodes of some anime are in English and I'm not really into reading subtitles so I have started some and don't finish. Other than that I deal with it and will continue watching, and trying to subscribe."

It does not let me disable notifications for it, nor uninstall or disable it. This is a dirty underhanded tactic by Samsung to coerce me to sign in and allow them to better collect data from my phone. I do not appreciate this and has sullied my otherwise positive opinion of Samsung. Please rethink your decision to try and force me into signing in!",
      "Hate it, you want everything from me just so you get my contacts and can get info. This app blows big time. If I don't allow this Samsung app my phone, sms etc doesn't work right. My sim is with a phone company, not you. I used to like samsung but now your greedy just like FB, google,twitter,all of you.ill find another app and delete all.",
      "Just another bloatware app I do not want, Samsung love your phones, but allow us to take any of yours or say Facebook's bloatware off my phone! I own my phone, so why can't I remove all this junk? You cannot turn off the background function on your apps which most I dont use and they just suck up battery power. Same with a fair amount of the other unwanted apps that can't be removed. This app is useless to me and just a way for you folks to gather marketing info on me, not nice!",

      "If I could would rate between 4 and 3. The app works rather well a majority of the time but there are 2 specific drawbacks that each takes away about 1 star. First, The ability to customize, organizing in a way that makes it easier for the user to access what is most relevant, is present but not prevalent and certainly has potential to expand. Second, A majority of Extinctions and tools do not work. I've used this app for 4 years, and it has improved greatly and would like it to keep growing :)",
      "This app is great!! I have used this app for almost 2 years and it has always been my savior in turning things in and remembering to do homework. Most, if not all, of the professors use this app, and so do the others at the school I'm transferring to this fall. Canvas is super easy to use on both android phones and computers.",
      "The App is bonkers af, bruh. The lectures when you try to open them? Doesn't load, and downloading them is such a chore, so slow even if you have stable connection to the internet. Notifications is meh, and vague af. And the most infuriating of all is the submission stages. Like... What. In. The. World. Even. Is. This. Many Uni might've used this App up to now, but this App is mediocre at best, does its job, but having their executions flopped.",
      "Definitely not the best app. It is convenient if you want to see your assignments but does not work 100%. The notifications barely work. I can't highlight anything in the text which is extremely important to me for creating notes. It needs a lot of work or a great update.",
      "In my previous review, I stated the app was broken. But, as of a few days ago, with little fanfare, the app was fixed. A little late, but better late than never, I guess. The app works fine, but I'm still a little sour about the app being broken for so long."

But recently the ability to select a choice of options when holding down on a item, has had no effect. Nothing appears when I hold my finger down to either look at the details or edit an item. It simply shows it's selected but denies the option to let me alter it. Please fix this bug, as it's very annoying to see.",
      "Despite the Android 10 update, the issue still persist. Currently using Samsung S10 Plus. In Internal storage, my files are sorted by name, in ascending order and list view. When I click to view a file in full screen and then swipe either left/right to view the next/previous file, the files are not sorted accordingly. It is still sorted by default i.e. date created and descending. Pls rectify soon. Thanks.",
      "After the newest update to Android 10 applications (such as Firefox) that download files (such as .PDF) have a pop-up at the bottom of the screen (says: \"Open\"); that always fails. If instead I use the pulldown Notification that fails too. Only by going directly to the File Manager, navigating to the \"Download\" directory, and clicking on the downloaded file does the subsequent 'Open With' pop-up work correctly. --- So I suspect that a 'tweak update' will be coming in a few weeks.",
      "A most unhelpful app. Constantly bothering me about running out of space, a fault of Android and Samsung installing apps I neither need or want and stupidly refusing to use the installed SD card for storage. It offers no useful solutions for the onboard memory running out and instead wastes time and processor on telling me about duplicate files in places that aren't running out of space. I've not installed a new app in months but suddenly now I'm running out of space.",
      "Its good app, but suddenly my sdcard is not working even I use card reader at the same time, its not working properly its just make my files disappear and cant open it, its instructing me to download an app on playstore its not helpful though. These problem arise before i update my samsung files i thought it will work if i update but its still the same. Dont know if its my samsung phone or what ever. Its make me sad to just buy another phone but im pissed to the gone files"

In the beginning the only choice was to add to list but when I was finished there was no list and nothing in my cart so I had to keep looking around until I was finally in the section to add to my cart then had to redo all my items. Very confusing app. I wouldn't be using if we weren't staying in since we are older and told to stay home.",

Why not at least place a pop-up message in the shop and scan screen that the issue is known and is being taken care of. Would save a lot of time and frustration to your customers.",
      "I have loved this app in the past, it had made shopping so easy. Unfortunately, I and many others have complained that the shop and scan feature isn't working. I don't see any helpful responses from the app builders on how to fix the issues, just more people, like myself, posting our frustration and asking for the app to be fixed. PLEASE, fix the issues as soon as possible.",

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app but haven't had the opportunity to try using it again. Now for some reason I'm unable to move the app icon to my phone's home screen. Frustrating.",

      "Needs to inform the user on a more regular basis about how much they're using their phone. What happens now is: you ise an app too much (say you've set a timer of 25 minutes for that specific app) and then at minute 24 you get a notification that you used up all of your time... Would be better if it were at 15, 20 and 24 minutes imho Great step in the right direction, though, to make people more aware of how (much) time they are wasting/spending staring at their phone",
      "Very good app for protecting users against addiction of smartphone and helps to disconnect while doing important work. Also it gives data of how much you use certain apps and helps to keep the time limit for that app. It pauses distracting app when you are on focus mode. It is the best app to let you sleep peacefully and stops all the notifications. But still waiting for more features in the upcoming updates.",
      "This application is good, but when I play Pubg, so ok I have about an hour and a half, but when I listen to Spotify (about one hour) I look back and it doesn't write anything to me. how much do I have on my mobile and say \"ahe\" my boy was on Pubg again for an hour and a half (and then he doesn't see that I was on Spotify anymore). And I'll tell you that I've tried it at least five times, and it never showed that Spotify!",
      "This has proven to be very beneficial to me in the mornings before work, when my phone is loaded with a ton of unimportant notifications. There are some bugs, though, and I'd like to file a bug report with the devs if possible (e.g. the push notification can't be cleared after it's issued, no matter the status value attached to it).",
      "Everything is cool and all but there are a lot of very essential features missing from this one. Not to compare or anything but this needs to have a weekly stat showing average usage, % of usage increased or decreased compared to last or previous weeks and categories in which one can manually choose apps to put in and have it somewhat like screen time. (Although categories isn't something very useful) But please consider having weekly average usage stat and % of usage increased or decreased."

      "The app is alright. When the presenter's connection is terrible we are never able to see the screen and such. However, if their connection is good, then the quality is actually not bad. Although, I would like the creators to add a “(s/b) is typing...” bubble when someone is typing. This will prevent any unnecessary anger grunts from our teachers when the class is not answering their questions, even when someone is typing as fast as possible.",
      "Has worked flawlessly for me for quite a while. Lately, sound quality is even decent on low bandwidth connections. Audio can be difficult to understand if presenters use cheap phone microphones and stand far away, but you can't blame the service for that.",
      "App is great, but the output volume is too loud on earphones even when my phone volume is set to it's minimum. I have to take my earphones out and set them near my ear to have the app not screech into my eardrums. An option to adjust output volume in-app would be really useful.",
      "Chaotic, laggy, plain unorganized. Do not get this. I was excited the first time I saw this app, now I know I'm being led to dread whenever I see it. Its just crazy to the limits. That morning I had art class, I couldn't hear anything and even when I could it was bad quality. I had to sit there for about four hours listening to the disturbing sounds of people shouting and voices lagging. If you ask me, that was a one star experience.If you think this app is good by the outside think again.",

      "Disappointed with the update process. Ive read some reviews of users who also experienced the same issue as i did, where suddenly the Maps will not show any direction, despite already showing the result of estimated time. There were a couple of updates that it has done this and had to uninstall and reinstalll app, which, frankly, is not the most ideal. (for those wondering, clearing the cache doesnt work. And if i had to uninstall the update, what's the point of having an update)",
      "no options on map to say stay on paved roads also comes to dead ends because of this where you can see where you need to go but you can't get there because there's no road. If there was an option to click. If there was an option to click about dirt roads. It would solve both these problems. Response to Google: You really don't know what paved roads are? And I am not returning to a place I rarely go to just so you can know what I'm talking about. Put the picture in a screenshot.",
      "It gets me where I need to go almost perfectly. But it needs some improvements. When I have an exit or turn coming up it sometimes doesn't let me know until right before it. Even if the turn isn't for 10 miles, it'd still be nice to know when it's coming up. Also when there are two left or right turn lanes to be told which one to be in. Finally, when I look up an address it'll say one distance, but when I start the route it's a more miles away than it said it'd be.",
      "Was working awesome for a long time! Now it absolutely sucks... Sucks so bad. The best thing the developers could do would be to swallow their pride and make the older version available. Hear me out. This version isnt better, it doesnt find routs faster and it has WAY to many buttons! Google has spent a lot of money in road mapping. Dont make it all waste.",
      "I agree with everyone that's complaining about this new app. I have had several problems also, the blue dot jumps around, never where I'm supposed to be, my timeline is all messed up saying I've been at a certain place when I haven't .I've cleared my cache turned off my location & reset my phone again & turned back on still the same issues. Also when I do go somewhere it shows up on another day instead of that day. I've done just about everything I read in the comments section & still nothing."

      "This is the real thing! I have been paid well over $100.00 in gift cards. at $5.00 each. they keep super detailed count of your earnings and I have never had a single problem. I could have made 4 times more had I followed their suggestion about how long to interact with each game. sometimes I would play a single game for over an hour when they had reminded me that the 4 minutes were over and went back. I have tried all of the other make money while playing, but none have come close. Kat B.",
      "Decided since we all have a lot of time on our hands, I would give this a shot. The 1st $5 was quick & easy so I set my sites on the $25 reward. That seemed to take forever! Still, it's a nice way to get a few extra bucks in your spare time. Also, I decided instead of getting a reward for the theater maybe I should get it for Amazon with the way things are going, I might need those emergency funds for toilet paper! Lol. Seriously tho, anyone reading this, stay safe & healthy please ♡",
      "I have used a lot of apps that reward you for playing games and doing survey's but this one is by far the best one. Within the first 2 days they basically gave me a 5 dollar gift card. Additionally, a few days later I had enough to get another 5 dollar gift card! I also recently had an issue with not being rewarded my points with I the app and contacted support and they fixed the issue for me within a day and a half.",
      "It sucks. All ur apps wont give me videos to watch. I was going good earlier. Now as usual it wont give me points. I've been trying since last july to get 1 of it 25 dollar cards. I've 7nenstalled hundreds of times, cleared all data, and restarted my phone. I've done everything any of u could possibly say for me to do and I still keep has having issues. Even hen I had my phone as brand new Las august someone told me it's my phone that's the problem. Even my moms bran new phone the app dont work.",
      "So glad that it worked! I was using Mistplay (which is awesome, too) and decided to try this one as well. It has multiple times of day where it allows you to get more points playing multiple games for a few hours, surveys, and you can watch ads to support them and or enter a contest to get a 5 dollar gift card. The games you play though do have a limit of having to be played for at least two minutes and those points are only made once a day. But they also have \"extended apps.\""

      "I love Briefing! It is a great way to stay up to date with the latest news and I love getting the notifications. However, as of lately it has been asking me to accept cookies or something and I'm just not to sure what to think about that.. I have yet to accept and they still notify me with articalls. Thank you Breifing!",
      "Oi, I found this app hidden in my phone. There doesn't seem to be a way to open it. The internet says that this was replaced by Bixby as a News Feed, and then included into it as a \"card\", and then Bixby was replaced by Samsung Daily. So what? Is this dead weight now? Can this be useful? Or should I just uninstall it and use Flipboard?",
      "This app feels like bloatware that no matter how many times I remove it, it comes back. If I ever click on the push notifications (THAT I DO NOT WANT BTW) It never takes me to the article that was displayed in their notification banner, and then is impossible to find in their feed. Overall, flipbook actually makes my experience on a Samsung in general much worse because it will not go away.",
      "Unhappy, this app came as bloatware on my phone. It. Can't be removed. I used I briefly on an old phone. I actually can't access the app through my app drawer, so can't really use, and can't remove it because it's bloatware. Upgraded review to 3 stars. This app may be useful to others who have a need for it.",
      "App was hidden. I hadn't seen this app until I went looking for bloatware. ( I came across a hidden app called \"Foundation). So I researched. Briefing is a news app. (Any news app is better than the google one. The same 15 stories for days on google). So I am changing my rating. Also, Flipboard is not factory installed, and this app was hidden so devs may want to have a word with Samsung."

      "Terrible. You open the app and doesn't let you play. It immediately wants you to buy the pro option. You can't play unless you buy it. This makes me think that there probably isn't just a free play option. Edit: found out that this company stole parts of a vidio on YouTube for their ads. The uploader did not give permission, and it's not even the same game. This is a terrible product, and the developers should be ashamed.",
      "Stupid touch app, lets you drag slime over the screen and charges 81$ for access to more slime. My 4 yr old has bought VIP, currently trying to gain a refund. I understand my child should have been watched a little closer, but even that aside, if I had bought this app for that much, it would still prompt a refund since the cost simply is not justified by the product. Will hopefully be able to repost a nice story soon.",
      "I mean I with alot of people on 1 star reviews! This app is horrible you can't play it because you get bored waiting for the X so then you can get of this add wanting you to buy products!Its getting annoying coming on a app that used to be great no adds or anything but now its just ruined! I hope nobody bought that add because its a waste! Whoever made this should be ashamed!",
      "Never got around to playing as the fact it's subscription-based put me off. Three days of free trial followed no free option but an immediate £49.49, whatever it was, is ridiculous considering the potential nothingness of this game. *edit - apparently there IS a free option, however the developers have designed this (very sneakily) so that it takes a long time for the X to close down the subscribe option (according to some reviews at least).",
      "lmao its funny how you dont even get do try it. it doesnt even deserve a 1 star, there should be none. its really funny tbh. if it were to have like, 5 options, then it would have been way better, but unfortunately, there is nothing. i expected less anyways. it looked, like not sketchy but kinda. disappointed, but defs not surprised."

Finally, it's difficult to find an item you're looking for... say you want the Rx (script list) to choose from But *NO* --- your Rx LIST is one place under a topic and the \"Request a Refill -or- a renewal is under a completely different topic: \"connect.\"",

      "Decent, not excellent, when it works. Utterly useless when it doesn't. Whether or not this app will sync is a bit of a coin toss. Particularly frustrating when it syncs parts of a conversation, leading to confusing replies. When it does work, it's useful but not great. The notifications for example are not clickable. In its present state I will not be keeping it. It feels like something that would be in late alpha/early beta stages. I wonder why Microsoft would allow something like this.",
      "I couldn't change my selected email on my pc from an old school email I had once used, even after removing the account i was prompted to sign back into the same one. The trouble shooting did not help me at all, and for some, reason it will continue to say that my phone has been linked, even when not properly linked. I would remove it to try and add it again, only to see that my device was never properly removed in the first place, as not even that function seems to work. Please fix this!!!!!!!",
      "Very nice App I love it. But there is one small issue. Sometimes it doesn't stays connected in order to synchronize so you have to start the app manually. But that's okay. Another thing which really bad is the missing support for other than standard calls. For example WhatsApp calls aren't supported. That's not good because in many regions the isn't a good cellular connection for VoLTE and the call quality of normal calls is really bad. I would love to see support for WhatsApp calls.",
      "This is an excellent app I am now using the app to write this. This app is very usefull to access the phone with my computer. I can easily use this app to interact with my laptop programs which in the past will not be easy to do. I can also access my phone w/o looking into the phone while I am working. Also this app allows me to use a physical keyboard w/o the need to link a keyboard to my phone. Excellent app.",
      "I left my phone in my locker at work. Battery around 80%. I come back a few hours later to find my phone is at 11%, and this app was the primary culprit. This app also consumed a TON of my data. Why? My computer wasn't even on at home! This app provides a valuable service but is not worth those pain points."

      "I am being forced to use this app for my pay for proctoring the SAT, nothing else.They ask for too much personal information. I've encountered several glitches. First, I could not enter my DOB, so a rep had to input it. Then I had to ask a friend to verify the info on my passport, an invasion of privacy. When I finally found someone who's willing to enter their info on the site, they were supposed to get an email asking for in person verification of my passport, but didn't get it.",
      "Just a waste of time as the App is totally glitchy and won't allow you to book even if position/gig available. Called several times to correct/inquire the issue but no help and basically told to delete it if it didn't suit me also asked on several calls if it was personal and if I was welcomed never a straight answer and after reading the other reviews I see it's not just me and I ask why not update the app with fixes.... bad customer service!!!",
      "My profile got deactivated after I called and ask why I was still In onboarding process.This app is not what it says. I am certified and sanitation. You will not be able to work with Adia if you do pass the phone interview you can not schedule for jobs and they will tell you why they choose not pick you and there is no second chance for an interview. I called and the told me I was denied.",
      "None of your links work the way they are supposed to. I cannot create a password or change one because the link to change it send me right back to the download page. We should be able to just sign up and create a password at that point. This is kind of goofy the way its set up.",
      "If I could give it 0 stars I would. I tried signing up with google and facebook and it wouldn't let. I then tried with email i put in most info and at the end it said there was an error and I'd have to try again later. Either fix the app or take it down already"

      "It's YouTube, but in an app. So that works The \"cast to TV\" function is very useful but so awfully placed that I often accidentally tap it while trying to adjust settings like video quality or subtitles. Also. There is this particularly annoying bug when I try to scroll downwards. Where it just forces me back to the top of the page. There's no way around it (eg scrolling slowly). Very frustrating. It keeps recurring every few months or so. I assumed it was fixed but it started up again today.",
      "Every time I run a video on the app, it takes 20 minutes for the video to stop and none of other videos are opening, I then need to wait for 15-20 mins to reopen the app and play the video again( ps: internet on wifi is running regular meanwhile, I can save the video but I can't watch it directly from your app)",
      "The overlay screen will remain over the video until I hit the X. Up until recently, it would not come up until I hit a blank area of the screen to bring up the screen to pause the video. Once I would hit play, the screen would disappear. Now it comes up over every video and I have to hit the X every time, in order to get rid of it and there's no timout. Very annoying.",
      "I get the whole digital marketing stuff but it's getting too annoying. First of all, not all ads should be displayed. Secondly, you recommend videos based on what the person usually views right? So let the ads coming be in that circle. I don't have to be listening to a gospel music and I'm cut by strip club advert😒 or something way out of league. Finally, please stop disrupting videos in the middle to play ad. It can come before or after but not the middle. And don't make the ads long. Thanks.",
      "Why the pause?! Ok so I get that I can access great content for free. They're bound to introduce more adverts as soon as they bring out a premium version. However, about once every 10 minutes my video will pause, and I have to press play to continue watching (screen says \"Thanks for confirming.\") which is incredibly annoying as I'm a baker all day and I use these videos for entertainment or tutorials and often don't have hands free to touch the screen. Remove this and I'd add another star :("

      "The older versions were simple and easy to use. But, there are things I don't like in this new update. 1. Some gesture controls have been changed. 2. The TABS IN GROUP style seems to be very complex and it is hard to getting used to. 3. Switching between two tabs is not easy like before. So I would be happy if the older layouts are used in the future updates.",
      "I've used this app extensively for years, and I've loved it. Recently, though, they've made a change get in the way you search for images. Once you search by image, and tap, \"View more sizes,\" the following view no longer displays the dimensions for the images. It was a nice touch and one that I really enjoyed, when looking for wallpapers, but now that it's gone, I don't think I'm going to be using this app, anymore.",
      "You need to fix your App. Been getting a lot of error messages for the past month. Apps are often unresponsive and won't open. Not having any of these issues on other Google sponsored browsers like Opera, and none on Bing. Prefer Chrome, but until you get these issues solved I'm switching over to something else. Note I have cleared the cache and data at least 3 or 4 times.",
      "This app is an absolute slap in the face to the user. At a time when MOST people use their mobile phones for everything, this app snatches away all the functionality of the desktop version. There's no easy way to duplicate a tab or close \"all\" or \"other\" tabs just by pressing on the tabs themselves. There is no way to save favorites on the homepage. No quick way to get to bookmarks. And worst of all, no option to have all sites open in desktop by default. Horrible user experience. Disaster!",
      "My chrome has also not been working since the last update, won't open or load any page. Have already uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared data, and followed all the troubleshooting instructions in the support pages. These are not a solution! Please help. I have already checked I'm connected to the internet and have already checked out your community answers, they do not solve the problem. Please don't reply with an unhelpful automated response!"

      "My number one question is: why? Since when do you have to pay for a fitness app? Things like this should be free, and you should have the option to subscribe, not be held against your will to do so. If the app is set for 30 days, how am I supposed to do the entire workout in three days? Fitness apps should not be 'purchased', they should be free, with the option to subscribe. If I asked (numerous) people around me, I'm sure they would agree. This app is not worth the download or your time. 👎",
      "SCAM! - 3 day trial is ridiculously short and after trying to find out how to cancel make sure I wasn't auto subscribed at the end of 3 days I couldn't find it. Apps developer literally copy pasted the same response for every problem even when people are saying support isn't getting back to them the response on here is to email support. Couldn't even see the first days exercise before signing up for the trial which automatically goes into a subscription. SCAM.",
      "Update- thought it was glitch on first day of tracking but 2nd day is same thing Be aware this does not work. 3-22-2020. Just installed and paid for 6 months. Completed initial setup until I click on intro workout. It then just keeps clocking.3-21-2020",
      "BEWARE THIS IS A SCAM!! After paying the premium monthly wage the app never opened and all the features are inaccessible, it kept crashing and crashing. Deleting and downloading again only offers the possibility to subscribe again and nothing works until you pay again. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP, THEY JUST STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "I want to cancel but cannot find away to do it! I got a 3 day trial period. Thought I would be interested in this app and only way I could see it is if I signed up and paid for it I'd tried it for 3 days free. I'm not going to try it, I'm not interested and it seems as they will make me pay at least one week before I can cancel! It's a scam to get you for some money, somehow! Found a way to cancel, you can't do it from the app, you need to go back to the page you downloaded it from."

      "Okay, I'm IN LOVE with this app but one thing that's really getting on my nerves is that it keeps merging my words together when I'm writing something. It's starting to become a hassle because I'll go on and do a hole sentence and I'd have to restart the entire sentence over two or three times. Please fix this!",
      "It's amazing but the only issue for me is that I can't make names for my personalized keyboards long at all, it says I can only make it 20 characters long but sometimes it only let's me do 17 or 16 characters. So I don't really think this is a issue for everyone one but I really want to be able to name my keyboards with longer names please.",
      "I really like this game because it have many function. I can add piano music. I make my face keyboard, GFriend keyboard, BTS keyboard and other. Good for all. I can add many shape like ❤ and other of the themes. I did'nt lie.",
      "Keeps deleting every sticker, theme and emoji right after I download it really frustrating might have to uninstall until fixed. Other than that was cool. I also don't know how to access certain features.",
      "It's great! But just one thing is that when I'm trying to type codes and stuff doe things it's annoying bcoz it keeps having spaces after the full stop or exclamation mark. But all in all its amazing! .. This is an edit. So a few days ago I posted the review and stated my problems. I'm glad to find out that the developers actually read these. And they helped me out in solving the problem. Sooo that's a five star from me! Soo defonetly download this! It's an amazing app!"

      "I am a big fan of Samsung software but this one app has a glitch. When I get an email, it says I have two emails. When I have 2 emails, it says I have three. This makes it impossible to view email previews in the notification page. It seems to only do that with Google mail. So I am forced to use the Google mail app for Gmail and for everything else I use Daum or Samsung mail. If this glitch did not occur, I would be very satisfied with Samsung mail",
      "I'm not sure why this changed recently, but please make swipe actions (move, delete, etc. by swiping from email list) only applicable to the latest email in that thread/chain/conversation. I've noticed now its affecting the all the emails of that thread in the same folder unless you open the email directly. Or, at least provide a setting so user can choose preference.",
      "UPDATE: 3.5 STAR. It works exactly like the Gmail app except better. It shows you all the messages from your multiple accounts in one section, and a delete all function when deleting multiple messages. Things I do not like about it is how they show this HUGE banners on top of the screen as part of OneUI, and it keep my Google accounts signed in on my Samsung internet browser.",
      "Nothing is perfect, however there is appeal in simplicity. The app does what I need it to. Allows me to select what should be filtered out and what I would want as \"top priority\". I like that I can have multiple e-mails signed in as well. If I could complain about anything, is that I should be able to change my adolescent email addresses. That's on me though so.. Lol. Good app!"

      "Extremely difficult to use. I mean it's a great idea to sort out lessons and response, however the execution is terrible. I can't find my response to the teacher due to moderation, but I don't even know if my response is submitted. The sorting is difficult to find and my fellow students often mistake one lesson to another due to bad design.",
      "Flipgrid is such a robust app for amplifying student voice! They keep improving this amazing free app and it just gets better and better. The disco library allows for teacher collaboration, shorts are fun ,and GridPals allow global connection. The fact that students can now splice various video clips together from the whiteboard feature, the flipping camera feature, the pull from camera roll feature added so much functionality. The Mixtapes make it possible to share highlights or compilations.",
      "I started using this app two days ago, and I already love it. It helps engage my students with each other on a face-to-face level. I also appreciate the security levels. One recommendation: I think teachers should have the option of approving videos before they are posted (like in Padlet). Thanks for this app during this Coronavirus school closing!",
      "We love the FlipGrid app! It is really easy to use! My students can reflect on questions that they may be apprehensive to answer in front of their peers. We use it to practice languages but also for the fun to do a a big search around the school! Flipgrid is constantly doing updates and adding new features to keep the Flipgrid improving! Flipgrid brings the student voice in to the classroom!!",
      "Love getting to hear my students' reflections and that they can respond at home or in school - so they have more time to process prompts and how they want to respond. It's especially nice now that we are going distance learning because we are staying connected!"

I bought the full personal package a couple years ago & recently recieved a free upgrade to access all languages! It was already more than worth the purchase so I am very grateful. If you actually want to start learning a language or brush up on your skills you won't regret the purchase!",
      "When I tried to do spanish it kept telling me I was doing it wrong. I personally took spanish classes and was looking for more help. I don't think this app is really good with its audio. When I try to speak into the audio its always says \"Please move to a quiet place and speak slower\". I usually speak fast so uhhh don't know what to do then.",
      "I also had the message \"SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG\" but after trying many things all I did was delete the app. Shut off my tablet. Waited 2 mins and turned it back on to reinstall and that solved the problem. Hopefully this helps others. The App version is actually very easy to use and learn. I'm satisfied.",
      "Very happy to have all languages available and grateful that they updated my purchase with it without me having to do anything. App is fun and easy to use and it checks for the accent which is the main thing. Excited to learn French and later Tagalog, Italian, Hebrew, and all the other languages I've been wanting to learn!",
      "I haven't used it much, but this is clearly not the typical language learning app I'm used to. I finished the first core lesson and didn't hear or see a single word in English, but I'm definitely more confident in what I've learned here than anywhere else. It's interesting, and in the best way. I can't wait to keep learning. :)"

The free program is always a pleasure and when you think about it, compared to everything else one might do for their mental (and physical) health, the pricing for the expanded programs is pretty fair. I definitely recommend this to all of my friends and family and to anyone reading this. What have you got to lose?",
      "I've been trying to sign up, to start with a meditation challenge and the app doesn't send me the activation email. When I try resending it doesn't work, when I try to click on the help center I also get an error message. I've been trying since yesterday, and nothing seems to work, like a cursed loop. Can someone help me with this, please?",
      "Recent update resulted in my inability to listen to the meditations continuously on my android device. The meditation cuts off every few minutes requiring me to restart it in the app. I have more than one meditation program I have tested this on.",
      "It is unfortunate that the recent updates have disabled many of the functionalities in the \"Free\" experience that are available in the paid version such as being able to listen to the meditation while reading the text or journaling. Shouldn't new users also have the opportunity to appreciate the full experience? After all, it is only for a limited time. Just sayin'... Thanks for listening...",
      "I am so thrilled that I used the app to meditate if only for the last day. This is my first time using the app. I was very apprehensive initially, thought it would be difficult. Could be age related!"

Angle calculation Freatures. I request you plz add these useful freature for smarter Google Calculator.",
      "After a big update on my phone, I noticed my calculator app was missing. So I had to reinstall. And it is now so much different than it was before. It's so cluttered by extras and I really don't like it. Why not give the option to turn all the extra features off and on? I don't need all that, I just need a basic calculator. And what happened to the clear button?",
      "It was ok until the system update. The format changed, now has answer on top in decimal and wierd fractions, big bar of signs i don't need in the middle, and smaller numbers on the bottom for doing calculations. If i have to do the system update for security, why does the format for simple apps like this have to change? Why?? Installed a more user-friendly calculator app and moved this to a folder of pre-installed apps that i don't use.",
      "UI looks weird in Oneplus 5t. Scientific calculator options stacked above number pad makes the UI look weird and complicated. Backspace and equals button arranged in second column aquires space that could be used to make the number pad bigger and spacious. UI should look similar to the sample image provided in Play Store",
      "Silly, doesn't behave like you would from an ordinary desktop calculator, for instance requiring Polish notation for square roots (root symbol first, that is, like you would write it on paper, rather than how you would enter it on a regular calculator, i.e. number, then operator). The features are also very limited. Where is base conversion, for instance? Surprising to see you can get such a seemingly simple app wrong."

      "Amazing game- but, I get kicked out a lot. Also, whenever I buy credits, I never get them. I've wasted money on this game thinking I'd get something out of it. Please fix this, I know everyone is working hard. But when you can, please fix this glitch or bug or whatever it is. I love your game, I really do. When things get fixed I'll update my review.",
      "The game Is really great but there's honestly a issue. So there's this thing called \"discovery\" and most players are mobile players but if you look at the photos you can tell that they're pc players. This gets on my nerves because us mobiles try our best to get on discovery but we just can't sometimes. My wish is if you guys could put more mobile players on discovery or make two categories. One side mobile the other pc. Love the game, though. :)",
      "So it was AMAZING until it logged me out and when I tried to log back in it didn't work. So I exited the app and waited. But then, it kept doing the same thing over and over again until I had to create a new account. But then it logged me out of THAT one and when I tried to go back in it said \"service unknown error\".",
      "My IMVU keeps logging me out and even if I'm on Wi-Fi I try to reopen it, all it says is that it can't load right now try again later. So I do and it still says it over and over. I love the game, don't get me wrong but I'm about to uninstall tge app if it keeps happening over and over. It has happend 7 times now.",
      "I love this game, its super fun to play! I met a lot of people. But, I tried to log in into my account, It said too many attempts even though I tried only ONCE. Also, when I tried to delete my account it would take me to the log in thing and it would say that my password is wrong. I only use 2 passwords and I tried both of them but it still said that it's wrong."

      "I hate to complain, because it might just be the best Word Processing app out there. But, there are innumerable problems with the interface - especially manipulating/dragging the cursor for editing. Also there are periodic discrepancies in template formatting, indentions, margins and paragraph spacing. All in all though, it gets the job done. And, as I said, it probably is the best mobile word processor out there. I'm sure that with time and updating the devs will get all of that fixed.",
      "Wonderful!!! It's more than wonderful this software has been a dream of mine for over twenty years I was first using Microsoft 98 word and word weaver. I think that was the name of the product that I had used. in my office supply and tool store. It was a really a good product back then. It really promoted my thoughts and ideas into a reality. Thank You. Office 365 is where it's at \" a good product \"",
      "This app seems to do most of what a desktop version of Word does. The trick is to figuring out what all of the little icons mean to do what you need to do. For example, you can convert a table to text, but it took me a while to figure out that there was a conversion *arrow* that looks similar to a \"back\" arrow (or *undo* arrow) that was actually the convert icon. I don't know if that example made sense, but the point is that you can do a lot with this if you're willing to figure it out.",
      "The interface is very janky and has numerous problems of which I cannot name from the top of my head right now. Despite this it \"gets the job done\" but despite this for simple editing such as moving images/shapes and paragraph spacing and intergers tend to be very janky. But I haven't had it for long but these are my first impressions on mobile.",
      "Not full-fledged like the Windows version, but good for the Android platform, well tailored to touch-screen interaction and a works well with mouse and keyboard on a tablet. You'll miss some features and sometimes find that annoying, but overall, it's probably the best word processing app you can get for your phone or tablet."

      "This app came with my new LG, and at 1st didn't know what to make of it (as per getting used to any new ph 🤣). Still, I now have all breaking news (at the moment), and other news coming to me at specific times (changeable), so is what I now rely on as my only source for news. It is geo-programmed for local news, as that's what I'm receiving. As well as world news, and sports. All conveniently tagged at the top of the page, and coming as SMS messages 😉 I LOVE IT !! 💯☝",
      "This app is very useful for news from all sides and has a very organized layout. There is even an option to read a more HTML version of stories if you have slow internet, or you can read them straight from the web. One thing, however, and something that cant really be changed, is that it's the source of my anxiety regarding coronavirus.",
      "Could be a cool way to get news. But most the bloggers here always repeat what they stated several times to make it seem longer and wastes more time than need be. Bloggers constantly use slang, misspelled word, and some articles seem to be made up bull with a caption and picture (that dont even match half the time) that are just to lure in more clicks. Some news is ok maybe even most but sll tge other things make it very hard to follow along and want to keep reading, like didn't finish eng1!",
      "I really like smart news with one exception: news items are let on the site too long. I can see native 2 days running however when I see articles beyond that I can't get but wonder if they're being used as filler material? Just wondering. I can even handle the repetitive ads as they're easy to skip. All in all I like how you provide the news. I read every day. Thank you very much.",
      "Great updated news in a person's area or whereever they choose for their location is to get their news from.Luv thee app. It's very easy to use. Luv the great info. that it give's me everyday.Thanks to all who helped in creating this great app. I really love getting daily updaate's on what's going on in thee area that's surrounding me and where I live,too.Thank's for thee great info. and everything else that I get with it,too.It helps me to be safe!✋😀🌈🌈"

I've tried to clear the cache, I've tried reaching out on Twitter a couple of time, and sent quite a few feedback reports, and nothing has been fixed, nor have I heard back from anyone. I just want my Drive fixed.",
      "I cannot access the files that I made available offline easily. They can't be managed by other apps. Folders cannot be downloaded to be used by other apps (files can be). Audio player tries not to be an audio player. Has no advantage over the other suite apps like Sheets. In other words I need to play audio files in order, but it doesn't do it well and doesn't let other apps do it. I don't want to download everything just because I might need them. So yeah, this app is a joke that is not funny",
      "I loved the app, until the problem appeared. I lost the comments on the pdf files. I think those were saved offline on my phone, and when they synchronized with the drive instead of sending comments to drive it seemed that they were overwritten by a file with no comments in it. So now comments are lost. Also, I couldn't add screenshots of the problem in the feedback tool, as you have only the option to add screenshot of the place from where you opened the feedback tool (a bit strange)",
      "Really love Google Drive. Keeps photos in touch whenever I accidentally delete them in my actual Gallery. I always take screenshots so it's really nice that I have separate folders for separate years because it's very organized just the way I like it. This isn't the only app I use to keep photos but it does get the job done and it makes me happy. It's not difficult to share or download whatever is in my drive unless you aren't a geeky kind of gal like me then I don't know how others use this.😅",
      "I think it's a good app it's pretty simple to use but I am having issues. I try to get rid of photos and folders and so i put them in the trash then i delete the trash; but when i find more things to get rid of and go to the trash all of my stuff is still there and now theres so much i have to buy storage even though i continuously try to get rid of the trash.

      "Too many playback errors. Sometimes the song will skip randomly in the middle, and others it will take forever to start. I have tried restarting the app several times, and even deleting and redownloading. However, after redownloading I had lost several items I recently added to my library. If these issues were a rarity, then it would be less of an issue. I hope there's a bug fix or something soon.",
      "I have been an android user since its debut. And I dont use any other player. Lately I have been having a few issues. My album art doesn't show up. While playing music in my vehicle via bluetooth, I can only see the initial song that's played. Once the song changes, it does not change on vehicle display. The app crashes but not often. Also, when streaming a playlist based on artist/song, I hear 5-7 songs, it begins repeating. OH YEAH, a customizable theme would be nice. Orange isnt for everyone.",
      "I've used this app for years now and never saw a reason to bother with another one. But now I need to switch to another option. I use music on my phone to deal with sensory issues. Unfortunately, Google has decided to start sneaking Tracks It Thinks I Might Like (I think) on my playlists every here and there. At first, I could delete them and found an option to tell it to stop downloading them. But now, it streams them instead, and I can't just get rid of them with the 'delete' button anymore. This is extremely disrupting and, in areas of higher stress/sensory input, downright distressing. I need to switch to another music player because and only because I can't find an \"off setting\" for its new \"add random music you don't own to your Playing Now\" habit. If they decide to fix this and I find out that they fixed it, I really wouldn't mind going back to it. But for now, it's a no-go for me.",
      "Ok so I really enjoy this app, but there is some room for improvment with the screening. Some things to change 1. Dont make it so easy to accidentally delete a song from your very time spent on play list by swiping left or right. Only leave the three button section with the delete option. 2. I really enjoy the download option, but dont make it so easy to undownload your playlist. 3. Put the shazam option back on to make it easier to find song. 4. Let us see the lyrics",
      "I can't even put my playlists in alphabetical order, which usually when I add music to a playlist it does it automatically anyway. And when I try to put all of a certain artist's music in a playlist, not even all of the songs will move over into that playlist. A lot of my album covers are also not showing up either. The app in general is also very buggy and definitely not what it used to be."

      "The app is great and the intentions of the app works wonders. However, only being able to get access and use through cell phone is not so great. My phone is too difficult for my daughter to do her work on and would be best if it was accessible for pc use, especially during the school shut downs and digital learning days where getting there work done at home is a requirement and the only school connected outlet for their education.",
      "This app is great for online learning! My only problem is I used to get notifications on the app itself when the teachers posted something or messaged us. Now the only way I know if something was added is through an email.",
      "Have used successfully last year and this year until installed on my new Galaxy S20+. Now I no longer receive push notifications on the phone, and yes I have the option to allow push notifications turned on. Have uninstalled and reinstalled with no luck.",
      "I don't like that it's 2 apps and you can't have access to the classes through the Parent$Family app!! They should make it one! I'm tired of downloading apps. I'm tired of any kind of screen time for kids any age really. I have no idea what the Seesaw for Classes is,but it better not have anything to do with watching videos.",
      "having so much touble with this app been trying for over an hour to log on i tried all the options to log on and it keeps telling me i have to scan my code but the app wont open the cam on my laptop that i have no choice but to use because my sons tablet wont even let him dowload the app"

Unfortunately, that now means (according to Microsoft customer service) that my phone number can never be associated with my account, even if the accidentally-created account is deleted. One little mistake on my end that any other business would be able to fix now means that this app is less than useless for me. :/",
      "This is a very bad application, I installed this application 5 month ago, they asked for a credit card information. I used if a few days and the App says the first month is free. After that few days I didn't use it anymore but they have charged me for 4 month. They didn't send any in-app notifications for charging or emails, despite the fact that they have already the email. On the other side , the settings is a complicated one and you can't find where to go for cancellation.",
      "This is a great app, since I started using Android phone, I have used Skype since then and the best thing about it is video and audio are very clean, which gives good quality, I like it. By using its app and I will always be in touch with it and I hope that things will come up on the sky better and the process will work and on the sky is the very good app,",
      "Terrible - This app does not work on my android tv box. Skype has downloaded but will not allow me to reach the sign in page. A pop up error message suggests checking my internet connection but there is nothing wrong with my WIFI or Ethernet connections. I guess I'm going to be even more socially distant from my family than planned.",
      "They eat up the money you load after a while. They send you email saying if you do not log in, you will loose your credit. If you miss to log in, it totally disappear. There is no way of talking to someone or getting an email address to send message. You are going looptiloop for hours on their site and find no way to contact them."

      "It's a very Good App, I'm only 18 I don't have the money for gym so I ended up using this which is Good for Me. If you're not sure how to do the step that is being shown, they have a Video for it. I liked this besides from playing Computer Games all day this makes me not so Lazy anymore. I often do things I have to do now, rather than just sitting all day playing. Thanks I am a bit buff now not that much though.",
      "This app is actually helping me keep progress and stay motivated. THE ONLY THING I wish is that it would transfer the data if used on a different device. I had to move to a galaxyS8 from a galaxyS7, but the data was gone even though I logged in with a same google account along with the synchronization. Just a heads up! Other than this, awesome app.",
      "Great to a point. That point being you need to describe the tempo on reach exercise for each level of fitness on each exercise to get maximum gain. Beginners will tend to go fast on the exercises thinking speed is the key when left to repetitions. After putting this review I received a reply. Instead of addressing the comment I was asked to give 5 stars?? I'm doing a 3-1-3 and still finishing quicker that the schedule time. Just answer the questions. 1 star now from 3",
      "Better than working with instruments at GYM. I said bye bye to my personal trainer after a week of this app. Whoever made this has food knowledge of exercises for all types of body. You aren't exhausted and you feel your muscles after each workout. Thanks to the guy who developed this. I love you whoever you are, I love you very much. Thanks thanks thanks a lot..."

      "First of all, this is literally just a copy of another app, right down to the database and all that. So I was scrolling through youtube, watching the great WillNE, and I find an ad for this app. I am also subscribed to a person I found a year back called narpy (great content, check him out). I had watched his video on wholesome minecraft before, and definitely did not expect this app to blatantly rip the video off of his channel, and yet they did. If anybody reading can, shut this all down.",
      "This app is horrible. The mods work but are bad, and sometimes laggy(Could be my wifi). The ads for this are stolen videos from youtubers. They've stolen from Arcade cloud, Narpy(Who are good channels,check them out if you have time) and a couple more(I think i don't really know i've only seen a couple ads). I'd rate this half a star if i could. Don't download this it is so fricking bad!i!",
      "I like the mods I think but there's some problems I always wanted this mod dragon mod but it won't do I want to keep on searching stuff it just says it's not there it's not real so I don't know what to say I give this a tree star because does Haz texture packs that I like but I don't like when they texture the spiders so yeah if you're not like texture pack person and you want to have like mods I don't request this for you",
      "The mods work and all but what I have a problem with is the advertising for this game! They steal others videos and say there mods! When there clearly not! Like the Steve and Alex animation where they go into Steve's Dream that was stolen and used for a ad! This is lazy and terrible advertising! They don't even credit the animator who made it! And this is exactly the same as Addons for mcpe! They've stolen the entire layout and everything! This is a terrible app do not download it!!",
      "The add for this app looks a little promising . Let's see what this app is actually look like .If this app is nice then , I probably will use t many times because I am very big fan of MineCraft . So , I think if I like the app I will use it many times . I , think this review is a little promising So , yeah you can count on the votes for this one ."

      "Will agree with people saying this app use to be great. I loved watching movies from Google play. But recently I rented The Joker but it was wasted money instead because I kept getting a message that said it can not playback and something about needing chromecast. It's a bummer because I was really looking forward to watching that movie. Now I cant watch any one the movies I've purchased in the past. I'm so sad 😭😭😭",
      "Used to be ok but now useless. I keep getting an error when trying to play anything in my library. The error says 'this type of playback isn't supported and I need to use Chromecast instead of mirroring' But I'm not trying to mirror my screen, just watch on my phone. Tried reinstalling the app but no difference. Used to work fine til yesterday so now my movie collection which I have paid alot of money to Google for is not accessible! Needs to be fixed urgently.",
      "1st, it's absolutely ridiculous that with an Android TV Box you CAN NOT download a content unless you use WiFi! I have a much faster Ethernet connection but it says I have to use WiFi! That is completely stupid! Second, you download the videos and good luck finding them. Of course even though I bought them there is no standard video file in the locations it says movie / tv files or stored, whether I tell it internal or SD Card. I'm disappointed I didn't know these things before I bought content. Just having to switch my box back forth from Gigabit Ethernet to WiFi is bad enough then to not be able to move them to my 2TB hard drive simply adds insult to injury!",
      "I love using this app for most of my digital media purchases. One problem, though and I'm not sure if it's being looked into or how deep it goes. I think whoever is in charge of creating thumbnails is completely unprofessional. My example is The Magicians in the newer seasons, whoever created the thumbnails is intentionally picking characters making a \"goofy\" face. Season four is a very emotional and powerful season, but the thumbnails created for it make it out to be a complete joke!",
      "Its a really great app. But when ever I'm trying to play some of the TV series. I purchased some episodes won't play. It keeps on saying error and try to restart my device if problem persists. I tried that. And it isn't working. And I still can't watch my purchased movies. When they are downloaded. Only on wifi. Please fix this"

      "No videos i select apparently have sound files with them. My internet connection is famtastic and all my other apps and devices are woking fine. Even your in videos advertisements are working phenomonally, but when it gets to the part i paid for the soundbyte goes out and its starting to make me angry. Im considering cancelling my subscription.",
      "The HBO app constantly kicks me out of the video saying they can't play the video, forces me to go back to then relaunch the video. I watched a movie where I had to do this about 50 times no joke, this is the most annoying Thing of this app. It would be one thing if it didn't happen on every show but it happens every single program I've ever watched and HBO since the moment I installed this app. I hope HBO has a fix for this because I can't believe I'm the only one that this is happening to",
      "Worst streaming service. Every interaction is frustrating. Too bad your burying good content with terrible ux. Rewind is frustrating. Navigating is frustrating. Getting kicked out is frustrating. Video quality is really bad. Loads forever. None of my other streaming apps do this I have solid fiber connection.",
      "I'm paying $25 a month so that ten minutes into a movie the app can stop working. Permanently. Turn the console off, uninstall the app, switch to a computer, it doesn't matter, the playback ends and won't go past the marker it first buffered at. And yes, it's across all my devices. I can watch Netflix, Hulu and Prime all in 4K but HBO, the most expensive one, crashes constantly. According to the help line, my internet download/upload and latency is more than DOUBLE what HBO requires to playback HD video. Their solution? To email me later when the \"app developers\" think of something. So answer me something. Why am I paying a monthly rate that is bonkers expensive compared to other streaming services for an app that quite actually has more buffering than a movie streaming site that will show me this title for FREE? The only thing this app has going for it is the original content which, while great, you can find anywhere else online with less buffering. And that doesn't cost you $25 a month.",
      "Frustrating interface that is not intuitive. No movie information page is available, it just immediately plays the movie with any touch, useless. Category organization is not employed unless an alphabetical only listing of every movie is the only category. Chromecast functionality appears to work."

      "Lessons are good for beginner guitarists so I don't want people to think this is a bad way to learn guitar or bass. If the app doesnt crash as often, it would get 4 stars. The app is almost unusable as it fequently crashes. I've been able to recreate this consistently while exiting full screen on videos or when going from lesson to exercise in landscape mode. If this gets fixed, then I'd say the lesson+user experience is pretty good, as the app layout is decent and the content is good.",
      "Tried to create an account on the website, nothing happened and I was stuck on the create an account screen, so I downloaded the app and tried to create an account, but it said I already had an account so I went to go sign in and apparently the login info was incorrect. I then went to reset my password to see if that would help, but nope. It gave me the reset code but nowhere to put it. Fender, you make good guitars and basses, but the shitties apps and websites.",
      "Great content and instructors. Possible to view tablature, chords etc along with the video. Nice mix of lessons and songs. There can be some slight video playback issues at times but they are getting better. Have contacted support who are fast to respond and friendly, they helped me work through a couple of app related issues and ensure that the video stuff is being ironed out (only reason for 4 stars). All in all a great app that helps you learn at your own pace. Recommended!",
      "No way to restart the practice mode without backing out of it and then clicking it again. The \"tabs\" don't have the sheet music along with it or any other way to know the timing of the music. It seems to freeze up a lot. Has no way to contact anyone about problems with the app.",
      "A great way to start learning how to play guitar, bass or ukulele!! Perhaps the best part is the Facebook Fender Play Support community! Everyone is very supportive of each other and offer tips to help overcome some of the harder parts of learning. Plus it's great to others are out there doing the same thing!"

      "Worst app ever you will be lucky to receive anything you purchase. When installed it permits itself to control and make changes to every single function on your device it can even control your wifi, scary eh! It gets worse, when you figure it out and disable all these self appointed permissions the device requires a security update a day or so later and everything goes back to the way it was. You are given the option to disable cookies but you can't actually do it .DO NOT INSTALL",
      "I really enjoyed use this app, I being used for almost 4 yrs now, and I really like the price the items and the enormously variation of items. Most everything arrives between 1to 3 months ( 3months was the maximum that I have to wait for a T-shirt one time), and I never get any troubles using my debit card, and they customer service is amazing, never fall me when I need a refund or exchange ect.",
      "I love this app! I think it is wonderful and so much better than wish! This app is fantastic and I shop on it almost constantly! I do wish that they would watch their products a little bit more, just to make sure that no one's ripping people off. I have seen one or two products that were not as the description!! but they are getting really good aboit catching thay stuff!!",
      "Not intuitive and nor easy to use. Need to go hunt around as some function/features not in obvious location. Re-evaluate: Still not intuitive to navigate. Had to sign in whenever I need to confirm delivery. Then had to look high and low for the pages. There are other online site that is very easy to use which I patronise more than this site.",
      "You site is cool but don't like it when you keep suggesting that you know what I am looking for. If I search for an item but the App keeps suggesting that I like other kind of products and every time I open the App the same previous items appear as if I were to keep loving them. I hate that and sometimes feel angry and uninstall the App and will Install it again the next time I wanna shop. I know that's what you think is that people love the same kind of things they search for in the engine"

      "Scan via phone's cam is a great feature and works very well, using a smart algorithm to aligning the angle so that the page does not need to be perfectly aligned. Scan via printer is not letting you change document sizes when using document feeder, only if in glass. Also, adding and reordering documents to a scan is not possible (anymore?). Would be very useful to address these two features in nearby updates. Communication between phone and printer is otherwise without complains.",
      "This app is not user friendly at all. Scanning is slow and trying to save a scanned document to my Google Drive is not possible on my Chrome Book. When I firs installed my HP printer, it was very difficult even hough I followed he directions precisely. Also, I am very disappointed that I have to \"manually\" print double-sided, and when I ask it to print 2 copies, it'll only print one copy. I don't know if the problem is with the app or the model of the HP printer I have.",
      "I have a new HP computer and bought a NEW HP OfficeJet 5258. I installed the HP Smart and connected it to my computer. The app just sits and 'spins', doesn't save or print. I literally am so frustrated with it I may take the printer back. I would think that since both computer and printer are HP, things would work seamlessly. But this seems to not be the case.",
      "Finally got it set up and connected. Printed the test page just fine, but when I tried to print from my Moto G 5 Plus it cancelled. All it says is \"cancelling\" on my phone but it isn't cancelling or printing. I can't even cancel it because it says it's cancelling. Can't delete it or do anything. I've turned the printer off and unplugged it but it still won't cancel. POS so far. I'm glad I didn't buy any spare cartridges.",
      "I have had different HP Printers with Instant Ink and they have all worked perfectly for me. I like how I can send an email directly to my printers email to print. Even if you are not at home, you can still print anything you need. I signed up for the fax service but I have not used it yet. There are different plans for the instant ink you can change to. 500 sheets of paper for $5 thru Amazon from HP is a great deal. I have been using HP Printers for years and I will never betray HP Thanks HP!"

      "Horrible app DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! I downloaded this thinking it would be a lot better then it is. All this app does is advertise for Hulu and Showtime apps. When you finally get to the \"movies\" all it is is a bunch of YouTube videos you can go and look at anytime by yourself with the YouTube channel. It is a complete waste of space, time and energy. Stay as far away from this app as possible!!!!",
      "Can't even get in the app because it just crashes and takes me out the second I try to get back in. Also, I just downloaded to see what a fake app this is because I'm assuming that you can't watch over 1000 movies for FREE. It's illegal to make an app with free movies anyway. 1 star do not download",
      "Awesome! Thank you so much for these services provided. So much less of a problem in comparison to some apps that don't respond as in perform in a sufficient and not so complicated manner. If you'd like to watch a movie, this app is for you, as it is for me.",

However, I get paranoid easily especially since I opened a photo stating that people should be aware of a particular URL link because it deals with sex trafficking and THIS APP RANDOMLY STARTED DOWNLOADING... 🤦🏼‍♀️ if this is really the case then I apologize for my judgement without looking at ALL the reviews and I really do hope it's just a preinstalled app. Thank you.",
      "This is by far the scariest thing that's happened To me as far as internet security goes. They hacked my phone. My gmail.then My laptop which ended up basically with a destroyed hard drive. And it's so obvious I'm being hacked. I spent hours and hours and Hours trying to figure out a way to get rid of these apps. Once I read the other reviews it became clear. This is a huge violation of privacy and if you have these apps you are definitely being hacked. Not by the NSA but by some clowns."

After your 3 day trial, and it doesn't even protect you as a vpn does, this app literally does nothing but take money, that's it! Please please refrain from downloading this app, it's not worth your time, or the money it takes",
      "Zero starts. I got fooled by the ads saying I could download gta5 on my phone if I download this app so I did after they offer you a free 3 day trial with absolutely no way to cancel that subscription thru the app or otherwise. There is no phone number to contact and only one Email address which despite my several Emails have no response whatsoever. This is cold blooded robery. Ohh n btw the gta5 offer seemed like a scam itself cuz I never even got the game after completing their offer. Be aware",
      "I installed this about on the pretense that it would verify My ph for the GTA5 app I downloaded, but It doesn't do that & when I did use it, it drops All the time. Plus, there's No instructions to unsubscribe anywhere in this app, which I am going to do...it has not done anything I was lead to believe it did!",
      "They make retarded ads that say \"get _____ (game only available on pc/controller) on your mobile device now,\" but in reality they just make you pay for the vpn and you get nothing in return. They can suck a big one."

      "Shopper here. This has been an enjoyable experience so far. My only nit-picky issue with this app is that it has no contogencie plan for when things don't go perfectly smooth (which 99% of the time nothing goes wrong). Only once was an Advantage card for a customer not accepted and had to be rescanned. I couldn't get the card to be presented again. Everything else has been A+",
      "I'm a new shopper, done a few shopping runs, however each run has major app connectivity problems!! Extremely frustrating when I'm at the store & I can't access the shopping list & none of the suggested solutions work. I even called support but was disconnected after 10 minutes on hold (30 minutes after arriving at the store). I have high speed internet on my phone & great cell reception. Please fix the problems!!!!! Also ought to pay shoppers for the time wasted when app is glitching!",
      "I was happy about the promise of orders automatically being removed from my dashboard. That is until I got stuck in a horrible nightmare of having an error I guess where that didn't happen. The app said to call my customer and to contact instacart care. I am currently on attempt number 4 to contact instacart. It has been over 3 hours so far. The chat system is completely useless. I have had 2 separate calls today disconnect before I got help.",
      "For the most part I like the app but I was having issues at checkout when the cards kept getting declines. I restart the app and I had already checked for updates and there was none. Very irritating doing double batches and can't checkout. Customers even added new cards still declined. Please look into features.",
      "I love the shopper app! Works so smoothly the only problem at aldi half the items do not scan and you have to force scan even thou its the correct item but I never have problems at cvs. Also the layout of the app on how to shop is wrong for aldi its not faster going by how they recommend you shoo because each store is layed out differently but other then that it works great abd with my gps. It does not drain my battery at all my mother has that problem thou but I dont overall very pleased"

      "The app works great for us. We use it through my son's school. I like how it quizzes the students after each book and some give the option to listen to it vs. just reading it. Also, it changes the level once you have completed all the books in the previous level.",
      "Although this seems like it has the potential to be a great app, we were only able to get through one book before the app started glitching. This is a school requirement and it would be greatly appreciated if this was fixed quickly. I see from other reviews that I am not the only one having this problem.",
      "First the mobile app is not in sync with the main site, it will says 48 activities to next level while the main site says 44 and the main site is right. Some books listening sessions never load and the kids keep struggling or just scroll to the end.",

      "I like this and use a lot but the Android camera app can scan at codes and display the text then you just have to tell it what to do with the info. Still, the camera doesn't always work as expected but this app does. This app works perfectly and captures the code with a distance and you don't have to stay still for a long time for scanning like the normal android camera.",
      "This app is the best. The best thing in the app is its size and it can also work with no active internet connection, but in this case, it is only able to display plain text contents of QR or bar codes. Such an amazing feature. Highly recommended app. Thanks.",
      "Superb..Work good! Easy and fast! QR code reader application is very easy and simple for use and it is a hundred percent working application and it is very useful application. Barcode scanner is very important and very useful application its real and perfect android application I have to use this totally real and brilliant app I like it so much.",

      "This is the best app I ever used to read a book online. Scanned the barcode over the book and read it online anytime anywhere and the best thing is that you can use your own choice of browser after scanning. The speed of scanning is also incredible Give it 5+ stars."

ANT Radio Service allows things like heart rate monitors, fitness equipment, garmin watches, etc, to connect to your phone & apps using the ANT+ protocol (much more effective than bluetooth and allows multiple connections). It is NOT some secret gov't conspiracy. Man some of you are real pieces of work. Unfortunately with Android Pie, built-in ANT+ seems to have been forgotten, which is a bummer.",
      "How did this app get on my phone and is it spyware? .... Bloatware.... Check permissions.... Yes this is an app that is preinstalled because this company paid Samsung or Google. The permissions to access sensitive information is present. It's funny when the developer has to say the app isn't spyware or bloatware because most of the time that is not true. Open source the code of the app so we, as the users, can see if your claims are true.",
      "STOP TRIPPING!! Its not a radio its FM frequency to connect Smart Watches and Fit Bit type devices so it can communicate with your phone. I bought a Fitbit at Christmas and all of a sudden I see this app on my phone. It didn't come pre-installed on my Samsung S8. It on newer versions now to help make the connection easier for Smart Watches. It helps wrist devices and the app on your phone communicate. It's NOT Spyware, Bloatware or adware.",
      "I understand what people are explaining about the app being preinstalled, and it is supposed to be helping the phone. However, I get paranoid easily especially since I opened a photo stating that people should be aware of a particular URL link because it deals with sex trafficking and THIS APP RANDOMLY STARTED DOWNLOADING... 🤦🏼‍♀️ if this is really the case then I apologize for my judgement without looking at ALL the reviews and I really do hope it's just a preinstalled app. Thank you.",
      "Let's face some facts. If this app's purpose had been to be helpful to users as opposed to privacy data gathering for others (I'm looking at you, Verizon, Samsung, and developer, et al), we'd be able to delete it if we wanted. Should it be any surprise that the developer assures us that it's entirely harmless? Sheesh!"

      "The app provides minimal information at best. After loggining in, the student/parent will automatically see the list of classes and the overall grade. However, when he or she clicks on the blue class link, the list of assignments and the grades for each one is not viewable. Lets say, the student has a D or F, this means that student will not log into the browser version of Focus to find out why their grade is low, they will just harass their teacher. \"Why you gave me an F?\" This is a problem.",
      "Terrible user interface, shows no more than your overall grade of each class and the slide feature is weird when you use it. But at least it shows you your grades without needing to get on a computer.",
      "It opens in your browser but is somehow worse because the window doesn't move or zoom, and only shows half of what it should.",
