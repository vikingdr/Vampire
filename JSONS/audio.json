      "Well this app is really cool cause you can download music for free. But recently I went into the app and went to my favorites and all the music was gone. All it said was \"having trouble connecting\" but I have perfect connection. My downloaded music is still there. Right now I'm stuck and I really don't know what to do üò¨",
      "This app was great, my favourite music downloader to use until I some of my downloaded/offline songs randomly dissapeared. Then today when I was trying to download music it would take ages then after a while it would say it was downloaded. But when I checked my offline thing the songs weren't even there which means I couldn't listen to them offline. I deleted the app and got it again in hope that I would fix it and I had to download my songs again but the same thing happened.",
      "I love listening to music and I have no problem with using this app ‚ô°üíú i used to have no problems but now when i try to download music sometimes it does not download the whole song and when it does work properly i listen to a song but then it always pauses on its own other than that i love it so if this is effective only on me then im sorry but if its not then please fix this thank you.",
      "I started paying for the premium subscription to get rid of the adds, but some of them still display on the bottom of the page. When I try to close them, the app tells me to upgrade to premium to get rid of adds. Please fix this and I will update to 5 stars. This is a great app with tons of good user playlists and a huge library of music though, so it is worth a download.",
      "I've been using this app for quite some time, I love it that almost all the songs I want to download are on this app. However, I don't like it that so many people put their custom version of a song I REALLY want to have and the actual song, without it being \"remixed\", isn't available. Other than that, it truly is a fantastic free song app and I recommend that anyone looking to download music use it. Also the fact that you can listen to all your songs offline, is really awesome."

      "This is the absulute best music so far. It records and plays st same time. thats cool. You easily throw a complete song together. The sound is clean. The app is buggy or invasive and its easy to use. I love the audio picking up frequencies I am assuming. It's my favorite app. No complaints. I'd happily pay for it. I haven't thought of that. Ill look around for you subscription or let me know how.",
      "I didn't realize my volume was down but to my surprise it recorded everything, I'm highly impressed. The first time I used it, I recorded an event from 8 to 5 and forgot to turn it off, it recorded thru the next day, our Sunday Service 7:45-11:00 when I realized it was still recording. I turned it off and laughed., still surprised at the great quality. I love it!",
      "Very useful! Got it to do an interview for school. Works well. Phone can record from a decent distance away and plays back audio very clearly. Very simple to use and playback. Also saved audio tracks don't take up much space which is nice. I recorded a 45 minute conversation and had no issues. Just press record and you're good to go. Highly recommend!",
      "This app is great! I've been struggling with being very forgetful for awhile, especially of important things like stuff discussed in doctor appointments. I downloaded this and have been using it to record certain doctors visits (after asking of course), so I can then play them back at a later time if I forgot certain things we talked about. It has been very helpful and the audio quality is great! I also like that you can see all of the bars moving during a recording so you know it is working.",
      "Pretty good. You cannot cast to any device so I had to download an app that will. Please try to fix it. Also, it makes it sound all scratchy so then I cannot listen, but that only happens sometimes. I only use it for my voice, but sometimes it makes it sound really bad during my voice lessons so then I have to delete it and it sucks. Please fix this too! But it also works pretty well, so that is why I am giving it 3 stars but just try and fix it, then i will give it a better result for others!!!"

      "Of course, right after I write a review of another editor saying it was probably the best app, I find one better. Wish it popped up a while ago. The reason this app doesn't get 5 stars is that it sometimes crashes. Otherwise, it matches both precision and useful tools. The upperhand is the output quality. Of the tracks I've edited, none had the annoying AF background glitch noises. Just what I wanted! I hope it stays that way.",

Thank you.",
      "The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it's useful for storing music. The only reasons I'm keeping it... it's a pre-install app in my phone and, it holds songs and original clips that I recorded and don't want to lose. Otherwise it would go straight in the trash. I don't like the layout and I absolutely HATE all of the ads that pop up everytime I open it to listen to music!",
      "I liked the app, easy to use. BUT i have a problem - some of my music folder's names are very long, and i can't see their full name. Can you please add this feature? I mean, that if a folder name is too long it would move / slide in a loop from left to right or right to left depending on the language used. Thank you.",
      "Honestly, in my own opinion, this music player is better than the one I had previously, the one I had previously repeated the same music until you opened the app and manually selected the song you wanted, but this music player is better than that...",
      "VERY GOOD. With this app I was able to set the levels in a way that I filtered out some very distracting sound artifacts from my noise canceling headphones. Not bad for a free app!"

You should also make it possible to add cover art for the album by searching for it within the player so you dont have to switch between the internet and the app. Same thing for the lyrics. Theres times when i go to edit the details of a song and after changing and saving them, the music player shows the song with the wrong information still.",
      "I downloaded this app as an alternative to my previous MP3 music player due to loss of privacy with the last App. However, this App works just as well, if not better as the last App, (Audify Music Player, for those wondering.) and I highly recommend the download! Navigating the App is simple, organizing songs is a breeze, functionality is great, all in all, a winner in my book.",
      "Adds... more bothersome than in my previous app which presumably spied on me. Taggs are not working, or rather it worked once until it gave up on me. Cant give more than 3 stars since i just downloaded it. Minus side also is that it doesnt recognize audio books (feature that i miss). Are there any positive things? At does seem to work. Themes and appearance looks better.",
      "Aside from a few bugs I really love this app! I found that when I go to my artists tab and sort by ascending, it only shows a few artists, although when I sort by descending it shows all of them, but I don't like sorting by descending :/ Still sorting by artist, the preview screen that shows all the artists also inaccurately displays how many songs or albums I have by the artist, and when I click on the artist, then it shows me a completely different amount, although at least it's accurate then.",
      "An amazing app no anoying ads, does everything it's supposed to, and background play. If I could rate more than 5 I would, this is a really good app. üëç Edit: When trying to put lyrics in with copy and paste for a specific song it wouldn't work, and I know it's not because I copied and pasted it wouldn't work even when i spelled somthing random and tried to save it. Not a big issue but should be fixed soon for people who care about it."

      "Excellent. Great selection of books and cheap audio books, especially if you DL on Kindle first. If you have Kindle Unlimited and your book is borrowed under that, then you get the book for a discounted rate. I've bought and listened to around 80 books and the quality is excellent. The app is easy to use and very user friendly. When looking for the next book in a series, it prompts you with it at the end of the current book. When searching an author in the store it won't show you books you have.",
      "I have been using audible every single day since I created my account, and I genuinely love it. Audible IMO has a very reasonable subscription model, and the sales have been great for me (especially since I'm into sci-fi and fantasy). There is a great selection of books, the app is intuitive and easy to use, although it's missing some key features like organizing library, and customer service is 10/10 every time.",
      "I do lots of driving for work. Audible presents a welcome variety from music. I was disappointed to discover not all books and titles can be found on Audible. I am happy to see them continuously expand the digital catalog. Warning! Some narrators can be painfully monotonous. Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy! Overall, I love the functionality of the app!",
      "Love the app overall. The one problem i have experienced is that every now and then when i return to the app, the audiobook position has been lost and has returned to beginning. I then have to skip forward incrementally to try to find my place. I have started using the bookmark feature regularly but this means turning the screen on every time. Hopefully this can be fixed in an update. Thanks.",
      "As much as I love audiobooks I hate this app. The search function for finding new books seems to have changed for the worse. Now I can't refine my search at all. There stupidly used to be two ways to search for new books, they seem to have gotten rid of the better one. Used to be where the search options were like they are on a browser, but now you have to rely on the terrible search bar at the top which doesn't let you refine your search anymore."

      "Very good, however when naming a finished recording the option to rename the recording doesn't take effect. You have to rename the recording after having accepted the automated title given. If this is ever to be fixed, I would like for the automated title function to remain the same but the option to rename the file needs to take effect when renamed with the first offer to rename the file. Hope this makes sense. Otherwise, good experience, with as little as I've explored.",
      "This app has been perfect for my school projects. If you need to do an oral presentation but have no after use of a fancy computer microphone, this app is perfect. I just send the recordings through email then attach them to my PowerPoint. Very easy!",
      "I mean it works.....but why am I asked to name the recording after I'm done recording, only for my list to look like the generic file names? In other words, it's not saving the name I give the file and now I have to go back and listen to every recording to remember which song is which. Not cool, fix it or I'm out.",
      "This app works REALLY well, the sound is great, and can record even from far off. The only down side is that its really hard to find a particular spot in the recordeding becuase theres no, 30 sec backward or forward. Other than that, i recomened this app!",
      "Downloaded this app because I needed to record my music lessons. After a very helpful lesson the app wouldent let me enter my recordings. My only option was to uninstall or to force stop which causes errors so... ya I'm mad, only had the app for an hour and this was my first recording on it. Do not recomend!!"

      "I use the audio manager screen. It used to have an option to hold the \"audio manager\" words for a number of seconds before taking you to the password screen. I got a new phone, and now I don't have that option. Now if I simply touch the words...even if by accident...the secret is revealed. I know about the escape password, but I'd rather not even allow my nosey significant other to get that far. Used to be a 5. Dropped at least 1.5 points for me for getting rid of that feature.",
      "I am using this app from last 4-5 years. It's having very good features and been working amazing but since I've updated it's new version, developed app s been deleting my vault storage. My all photos and other media has been disappeared and backup sync date is also clear. M not understanding why but this app is now eating media without any backup. This is happened thrice in a week.",
      "Best Hide App Ever! Been using it for years and am happy to report that the ads are no more than a small banner at the top. I tried to give some others a go and they will do full screen ads. Not this! Easy to use and ads are not a pain!",
      "This app is great but there's a problem when this new update i cannot see a thumbnail of all my video i added i can only see the name of the video but no thumbnail at all . It needed to be fix because it's annoying for me to find my hidden favorite video if i can only see a tittle ."

      "I was going to write a long winded review but, brevity is wit. So simply, just try this app. You won't regret it. It does almost everything you might need to create custom mp3 files for your mobile. Conversion of video and other audio formats to mp3, trim or merge, and editing of tags and filenames is here. You can share your edited files with other apps too. It just works.",
      "Firstly, the Ads cover so much of the screen that it's hard to see where the controls are. Secondly, it doesn't tell WHAT FORMAT the files are being converted to. I simply wanted to trim an .mp3 file to upload to a site. Instead it converted the file (without telling me) to an .mpeg file, which is unusable for that particular site. I know people have to make money in this society, but when Ads take precedence over quality programming, it just sucks.",
      "It's a great app and I've been using it since 2017. However, there /are/ way too many ads that pop up in your face every two seconds, but the full version is like 2 dollars so to be honest I wouldn't complain much about that. A feature I'd love to see added is a speed adjuster of some sorts, I think that would make the app go from good to great. Overall a decent app, and I love the tag editor feature.",
      "Very popular, perhaps easy to use, but lacking important options. If I want good audio quality recordings with my Lenovo, I have to choose WAV format. This smartphone uses only one mic, but records unnecessarily in stereo, spending twice the real amount of data. This program does not allow to eliminate the redudant audio channel, making all conversions (mp3, ogg, etc.) and editions (trimming) unnecessary big. It is alsi very slow converting WAVS into MP3. There are better options.",
      "Works exact i was searchin for....and plz add these features in update too..1)crossfade 2)normalise for even audio 3) optn to select multiple files at same time to merge...selecting one by one is frustrating 4)slide feature in merge to arrange order fast..up..nd down takes too much time."

      "soundclouds been good to me when it came to listening to anime openings and such, but recently every time i open the app it just closes down. immediately. if it doesnt immediately, then it does as soon as u play something. id like to listen to music here more but i guess not?? since the app doesnt even work???",
      "It's amazing u can stream a lot of music on here if u have ur favorite followed you get notified when they drop some new songs. But what I love mostly is the fun of discovering new completely unheard of artists. Though I rated it 4star the other star is it doesn't give you control of the songs you drop if you are an artist it doesn't give u control of your profile but overall it's an amazing App",
      "Intolerable lack of functionality. Cannot add or delete your own tracks from the app, can only be done from a pc!!! Now file browsers won't pick up soundcloud in sharing options, this thing is useless. Cannot manage your own music with it on the very device you're likely to part produce it. Can't even use the website on mobile to compensate. Tired of waiting for SoundCloud to listen to its users. Dumped as the annoyance it is. Ludicrous attitude to functionality. Ignorant, obdurate, and a fail.",
      "I've been using SoundCloud for 2 or 3 years now. Overall, it's been pretty good although I've noticed some changes over the years. Slowly there's been more ads added and more \"you need the unlimited version to listen to-\" when this app was, or what I originally thought, a way to listen to music 'free' Either way, it still works well and is useful. There's plently of artist on there that are up and coming, not to mention lots of covers. I'd recommend seeing that it's still technically free & good"

      "I've used this app for years now and never saw a reason to bother with another one. But now I need to switch to another option. I use music on my phone to deal with sensory issues. Unfortunately, Google has decided to start sneaking Tracks It Thinks I Might Like (I think) on my playlists every here and there. At first, I could delete them and found an option to tell it to stop downloading them. But now, it streams them instead, and I can't just get rid of them with the 'delete' button anymore. This is extremely disrupting and, in areas of higher stress/sensory input, downright distressing. I need to switch to another music player because and only because I can't find an \"off setting\" for its new \"add random music you don't own to your Playing Now\" habit. If they decide to fix this and I find out that they fixed it, I really wouldn't mind going back to it. But for now, it's a no-go for me.",
      "Has a lot of problems really. It crashes, it always restarts the songs everytime I play them. I can't find most of the artists I listen. I mean Bethel Music is a really popular group but they don't have most of their content. Scrolling problem, not enough distance between the 3 dots and the scroll line. I'm really dissatisfied. Please fix it.",
      "Can you please fix the scroll problem? There is very little space between the scroll bar and the three dots symbol for each song. This is incredibly frustrating when you are trying to add multiple songs to a playlist. If you tap a couple of millimeters to the right, the scroll button gets activated and takes you to a random portion of the song list. I can't believe Google hasn't fixed this yet.",
      "Weird beeping has started to play every time a button is pressed or the song auto plays to the next in a play list SO ANNOYING, can't seem to find a fix for this. It is random, sometimes it's there and other times it doesn't do it. Have sent feedback from the app but that goes no where. I'm going to download all my songs and use the dafault Samsung music app.",
      "Best music player before I began to use a samsung. Even now, play music is yet one of the top music apps; if not among the top 3. However, we can add the search feature to the app, so one could search, stream and download any music. This would perfect play music and increase the rate of downloads. Already, it's been from Google LLC, but adding the feature suggested would make this app top 3. Another feature we can add is the dark mode. Thanks and well done Google LLC. Nick, Nigeria."

      "This has been a great app for a while. I like it much better than Google Play music. But recently I've been having issues with it. I have continuous play on but it will only play 3-4 songs then close the app. I'm hoping there will be a fix soon or I will have to delete it. Update : It won't add tracks to my playlist! Sometimes the music stops between tracks until I unlock the screen.",
      "My phone was having problems with a number apps, it could slow down and I was forced to uninstall a couple of other music apps, document viewing apps, even shareit as well, but I'm glad this music player is running perfectly fine. It never slowed down my device, neither did it fail to respond like the apps I was forced to uninstall did. The features of this app are really good, a number of options which I can 'manipulate' as per my wish.",
      "This works well so far, it comes complete with bass boost and equalizer (and they actually work). And for once I can edit my song's tags, it this is a amazing and efficient app. It's got customizable everything on it as well even the color! Keep up the good work and I love how if you do decide to buy this app its not over priced either just 2$ thanks again whoever developed this app.... had this app for six months now it still works great organizes my videos and my music awesomly!!!",
      "Excellent. It displays folders with music and can play it. You can rewind a song forward or back, a feature not every music player has, but this player has it. Other players are full of unnecessary features that are annoying, but this one is simpler and easier to use.",
      "This is the best, quickest, user friendly application I've come across in all my years of trying out hundreds. If you like your music then download and give this a go. I love the options, esp to record and drive mode. Good job guys."

      "Hi, used it for the first time just now, and am very impressed at the ease with I was able to edit music, and mixing, video editing, video to audio are all impressive, especially ease of use - for amateurs like me, this is great but I feel Expert Users will also find it very useful particularly the time it saves. Will update as I gain some more experience - thanks team, 5üåü, no doubt.",
      "Excellent Ap thus far. I compose music on a Yamaha Piano, and I am interested in how Super Sound may Augment my works. The Equalizer function is extremely helpful in correcting anomolies present in recording. Sometimes, my recordings sound muffled, as if listening to them from inside a barrel or drum. To fix this undesired atmosphere effects: I reduced the 230 Hz slider; whilst increasing the 910 & 3600 Hz sliders. This adjustment usually clarifies the piano and accompanied stringed instruments.",
      "Not used. I dont know how yet. I want to take a song i recorded using video recorder and make it an audio file to add to my music on my phone. Id love to cut a ring tone from it too. But...so far im lost. But this app has other wonder possibilities for other things im sure. I'll let cha all kmow how it goes down the road. K?",
      "Subject to change, i dl this app only to trim audio files in mp3 format. On a scale of 1-10, it does that excellently. My only suggestion to the creators is to give you option to replace the original or make a copy. Also i dinged the app for asking me to rate it after completing every action I did. Kinda annoying guys."

      "The best audio editing tool for Android. Great, clean, responsive UI which allows you to quickly get the job done. As well as the superb built-in effects, the real gem of this app for me is the conversion tool. Works with so many different input types and is super useful, again with a perfectly pitched interface which let's you get the job done in a couple of taps. Highly recommended!",
      "It's an excellent app for mastering and mixing my music. The recforge 2 app compliments it well too in my opinion. My 2 problems are though, it always seem to take a whole lot of storage when I'm working on a specific audio depending on how long the audio is. Please try to minimize this large storage required. My next problem is that I prefered the older version of the app. The newer versions seems a little bit more complicated.",
      "Hi, where can I find the documentation for the app? I cannot find the way to perform simple tasks. For example, if I play the sound and pause it, I cannot move the payhead into any new position. I can only stop it which moves the playhead automatically to the beginning. The little red tip of the playhead detaches, and I can move it, but that is not where the sound will play. Thanks. [Edit: got it. First I need to move the top of the playhead detached, and then hit \"stop\" to move the playhead to the new position. This is really counter-intuitive UX. Some basic documentation is needed to avoid the frustration.]",
      "I use this to cut up songs for a ringtone. It is extremely easy to use and intuitive. The ads are also not intrusive at all. I have not encountered any popups after a few months of using. I am not an advanced user but if you are wanting basic functionality then this is a great choice.",
      "This app looks to be one among the best, but I can't see anyone who wants professional audio using this app. There's no external mic support, like the lav mic for phones I'm using. I love that you can disable noise suppresion here, since not even Shure recording app has it. Noy having the ability to use my external mic is a bigger dealbreaker though. If this feature is added I will do a thorough review and update my review."

Lastly, if you're looking to add features, I don't think you could good wrong with more settings. Personally I'd like to be able to pick random decks/tapes out of my own list as apposed to the total pool they normally random from. Love the app, a must have on every device. Thanks for deving, you guys rule.",
      "I like the novelty look!!. The 1st try worked fine but when I tried to record again, the wheels were turning but the counter stayed at zero. Played back what I recorded and nada. I'm thinking it's something simple but can't figure it out. Ugh!!",
      "I would give this app 5 stars, but you can not send the sound files via text messages, which kinda sucks in my case. I will say though, the layout, design, and sound quality are great",
      "This app is absolutely amazing, you can record, any time, place and records whilst phone is locked. You can also pause and play back, so you don't miss any conversations. 5 Stars.",
      "I. Love. This. App. The graphics are bitchin'. The recording quality is on par with your device. Great for song writing or any creative practice stuff. Quick notes. Dare I say; rad."

      "I would give 5 but recently it started playing different songs than what it said. I figured it was my phone so I tested it when I later got a new one (for different reasons) and the same thing happens. It says x song but I'm hearing y song. It wouldn't be a problem if it was just when I'm scuffling ALL of my songs but it happens when I'm listening to one of my playlists. Itll play songs that aren't even on the playlist. Please fix this, its very frustrating",
      "A great app for playing your music. The interface is costumizable and many skin options to choose from. You can edit song tags, playlist and add album covers. The colors match the album cover which is a nice visual. The free version has pop up ads and the EQ is not that perfect, but overall is way better than Google Play. Highly recommend.",
      "I find this to be a great music player. I wanted a music player that would recognize folders because of how I sort my music . The previous app I was using developed a bug that would automatically play the last song from my phone when I got in my car weather her I called it up or not. I still really like this music player, but I don't like the adds that interrupt everything. I decided to spend the 6.99 ONE-TIME purchase to remove adds. My subscription went through as .99/monthly. This is the choice that I didn't want. I don't know how to change this. They just forced me into the more expensive plan. NOT COOL!",
      "This is the best media player I've used by far. No gripes whatsoever, keep up the good work! Edit: VERY unfortunate that I have to re-rate this app so low... It seems they started focusing more on full screen, spammy ads than the actual experience of the user. It lags horribly now and will even completely hang up mid-song forcing you to restart your phone before it will play again (that or do a hard restart of the app which is a long process when you have the widget install on your homepage).",
      "This is a fantastic music player . . . when you buy it. The ads are super-intrusive if you don't. Have fun waiting five seconds for the playable ads to disappear every single time you want to switch songs. Docked it a point for that. Still rated it a four though because what is there is great. Making playlists and editing tags are easy to do and you can customize how it looks using either the basic colors the app offers or even using pictures from your phone. It's a good."

      "I purchased the ad free version. Now I cannot add any song to any play list. It happened after I purchased the ad free plugin. Wanted to purchase the HD version but after that also if the play list cannot be added there is no point. And the other thing is the feedback. No feedback at all",
      "This is the best music app you can get for free. It has: a 10 band graphic EQ, preamp. -10db to + 10 db. The preamp comes BEFORE THE EQ and not after like in iTunes, another bass tone control and Varible replay gain. You have the option of using a 32 bit, 192 khz engine which means if you have high definition files you can play them without a sample rate reduction or Truncating the last 8 or 16 bits. - Gapless playback. AND THE 10 BAND EQ IS STILL FREE!",
      "Well done Team Jet! Love this app (and I've bought most of the front runners). Above all, the sound quality is superb, very well balanced. Picks out the finer high-end details in tracks as well as offering plenty of solid low end to pack a punch. With a sublime and highly customisable user interface, this really stacks up to be one of if not the best premium audiophile-grade music player!!",
      "plays .aiff files, that's good. has ads and the close icon is tricky to hit at times, too bad we can't swipe an ad away. edit: forgot to mention the first EQ at the top of the system tray is great. especially in the car's sound system, just be mindful not to blow your speakers out.",
      "Deleting and finding new and much better app. Went downhill... had this player for 10 years, and now can't listen to music, as it shuts off-probably due to ads when locked. Very disappointed. Have to search for new player. Won't waste money buying this, especially if it didn't fix this issue."

I really suspect it records you outside of the app. It was super buggy while I was using it and when I tried closing out of it, it made my phone run very slow like it was still running in the background. When I went to clear my phone's memory space it said that it wasn't able to clear an app's cache (which I've never seen before.) My phone then forced me to restart my phone in Safe Mode only then was I able to uninstall it. All the positive reviews seem fake too.",
      "Got it for the echo. 4 a phone app it is better than expected on instrumental stuff..5***** for that. Not so for music and lyrics. Music still sounds good with the echo, but can't get echo I want for lyrics. 2 tracks would be awesome so you could record your music, then hook into your phones port w/ a headset and mic, allowing you to record your lyrics as you listen to the music. Keeping them both as separate temp files, then add echo, listen, edit until satisfied."

Lots of useful effects & features in this app. But when I attempt to remove the ads (I'm even willing to pay to pay the $4 fee to upgrade)...I get a \"server connection issue\" error message. It seems that I'm stuck with the ads...seems that they don't want my money! So, only 4 stars now. Fix this for the full 5 stars! Problem fixed!",
      "I'm an old user of this app. Since 2016! Whenever I change my phone I always remember to download this app. I always wish to have a better version of this app. But recently I'm using a Samsung phone and I'm having some issues like it's automatically disable the bass whenever I change the volume. Now I have to hear the entire song with same volume to continue bass mode on or hear the song with bass by continously turn it (Bass) on whenever I change the volume. So what should I do now? Help me!",
      "Tried lots of music apps. This is one of my favourites . Most other app are a variation of the same thing, this has a different layout, the colour and look can be customized by the user. Variable crossfade, graphic equaliser and a nice big volume control knob which a lot don't have. Displays Album art, track and artist info NO INTRUSIVE ADDS.",
      "Decent app...but a few significant probs for me. When on the playing track screen and I navigate to library, it doesn't start at the artist or album I'm currently listening to; it defaults to the top of whatever is in my library. Also the track being played doesn't interface correctly through bluetooth to my vehicle screen via \"Ford Pass App\" connectivity.",
      "I have had this app for as long as I can remember, and I'm sorry to say that I may be removing it. The app plays music quieter than the mp3 file is even when the volume is at max and the extra volume control is at max. I had this at a five star rating before I ran into this glitch."

      "The best at all amongst all other players that are available on the Google play store in terms of performance, UI, them, visualizer, customizing options, beautiful animations, very elegant,  It feels so much better, But one only thing that I didn't love is that it can't change and song or album info although the option of change tags is available but It doesn't work, it seems working on it self I mean u can see the changes only in powerramp but u can't see that in other apps Which's not good",
      "Please add the A-B repeat option. That's the only thing that this app needs. I cannot explain the how good is this app in words because there are so many of them. The first app on Google Play which I bought. Because this app just suite my usage and option I am looking for and the price is also too reasonable and low.",
      "INCONSISTENT. They're constantly changing the settings (for the worse). Has way TOO MANY options, & most don't work properly. Paid for this years ago, & used to love it. Has gotten progressively worse, & I'm FED UP with having to reconfigure the player every time, to simply play my f%@#!n music. UPDATE 3/7/20: Now that I left a bad review, player mysteriously deleted 1/2 of my 4500 mp3s before I shut my phone off to stop it. Thank God I have them backed up on my computer. F.U. PowerAmp !!!",
      "The OG...been using power amp since the 90's, still great! Bought the app for my first smart phone and have been getting massive amounts of use from it since, feels kinda cheap on my end honestly, I spent $4 like 15 years ago and this is still my favorite music app and it will be yours too once you get used to it, very powerful player with huge amounts of options and deep control. Huge fan of the app and the company, you won't regret use this and like me you'll end up buying it eventually!",
      "Before the forced Android 10 update from AT&T this app worked fine on my Note 9. Now, however, every time I plug my phone into a TV (using a HDMI connection) the player just starts playing automatically at full volume. It is totally annoying. I have the poweramp paid version. Also I have the poweramp widget on my home screen. After you fix this, I will change my review from 3 to 5 stars."

Best bet is this thing is garbage and for lazy children and put Strait linux on your phone like fedora or Ubuntu and use a real program like audacity or ardour; not this garbage. *** you have to be special kind of f***** for this to work because not only will you lose tracks but you have to manually align. There is latency when recording.",
      "Completely disappointed I used the free version for months and loved it never had any problems out of all similar apps I found this 2 be the best so I purchased the pro version and it hasn't worked at all since, not 1 time would give free version 5 stars and the best review but as for this pro version I wish I could give it negative 5 stars but it made me give atleast 1. Worst money I've ever spent in my life and the unhappiest I've ever been with any product. Sincerely unhappy customer!!!!!!!!!",
      "I've been using this app for years, nothing changed about the app since then, but the ads gets worse and worse, and syncing multiple musics is terrible after saving it to mp3, plz fix these bugs and lessen the ads and I will rate 5 stars",
      "Good for editing the songs for videos of YouTube! Also, It doesn't play the saved music file with the pitch edited on. Add a feature to save a track with edited pitch!",
      "It's cool. A little fine tuning will just be fine. Add more effects as well. Make it simulate a real recording studio."

      "The last update sucks, now I can't adjust the eq fast and normally from the rotating wheel buttons, i have to press 1 more button to reach there and I'm not complaining just about that, I am complaining about the delay from when I press that button to when the rotating wheels show up WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING SOUNDASSISTANT ARE YOU RECOMPILING YOURSELF EVERY TIME I OPEN YOU",
      "Multi sound still works with only one app",
      "Some apps are so rude. Like Words With Friends. Words With Friends has no option to control the volume of their annoying commercials. This app fixes that! This app is native to the Samsung device and returns sound control to the user. There are dozens of other incredibly useful features included in this app. I suggest giving it a try. PS. Dual App Sound wins everything.... Imagine composing voice-to-text while the music keeps playing... BEST FEATURE EVER.",
      "This app is great! It should come standard with Samsung phones IMO. It gives you the ability to control individual app volumes instead of one volume for everything running on your phone. I use this app to keep my music player uninterrupted while i play games. Also gives you the ability to control alerts through headphones, left and right pan, and much more! Useful app for sure.",
      "Worked fine, till I reset my note 8. I tell it to mute when I turn on my headphones. It either still rings in the phone, and headset, or rings no where, since everything is muted, even when the plantronics bluetooth headset is turned off. Dropping it to one star from 3. Went to a jabra headset, and either in the morning when it is supposed to turn on the ringer it doesn't, or when the headset is turned off, it doesn't switch to use audio, unless I manually turn the ringer on."

      "I use this app to listen to books while I am on the road. It's a good enough app but it has some quirks on my Google Pixel 4XL running Android 10. 1. Once I set up my home page it resets to the default when I reopen the app. 2. I can pause via Bluetooth but I can only get it to play by tapping play the phone. I don't have this problem with any other app. Please fix this so I can rate this app higher.",
      "I love this app!!! The different narrators really spice up my experience! I am someone who can't focus on reading very easily, but listening works well with my brain. Unfortunately I can't afford and audible subscription, so when I found this I was OVER THE MOON!! Now I can finally read as much as my friends and mentors!",
      "Wonderful app with loads of public domain and classic literature. Very easy to use as well. Wish the reader's audio quality was more consistent, as some are clear and others difficult to understand. If not for this, I'd have given 5 stars. However, nearly all these books are being read by volunteers - making a great deal of their audiobooks completely free. Fair trade off all things considered. That being said, if you want new releases with a higher audio consistency I suggest looking elsewhere.",
      "Only thing that I think this app is missing is a better search engine. As far as I have seen, there no way to filter my search at all. I am very grateful that there are so many free books to choose from. I have eyesight problems. If it weren't for Librovox, I wouldn't be able to enjoy one of my favorite pass times. Thank you! Update: I no longer have any complaints whatsoever! The search engine is great! Your customer service is prompt and helpful! Librovox is great!",
      "Really good app and superb customer service. However, lately there seems to be a lot of spam in the new uploads. I check what's new from time to time, but can no longer do that because there are hundreds of uploads by the same person (usually religious teachings). It would be great to either a) limit the number of uploads per week or b) have a filter for the new uploads. Also, it would be great to be able to sort my Favourites list by length of audiobook. That would be absolutely amazing!"

      "Beautiful simplicity, this is one of those apps that should actually come as a standard for android. Easy to use, clean interface and crisp sound. It's a little detail but personally I really like the soundwave visualization in the background. Would have given it 5 stars but, i.m.h.o., there are two things that seem missing. The first one would be a 'dark mode' or options to change the color palette. The second thing I'd like to see would be something of a 'stealth mode'. Still a great app!",
      "Decent recorder. Still glitchy. Nothing quite like having it unexpectedly stop recording or creating an unplayable wav file.i use it a lot, but make sure that I'm not recording anything longer than 20 minutes or so, since it is still untrustworthyb in terms of stability.",
      "Excellent app so far I haven't experienced any difficulty, I use it for my news bulletin I am an anchor for a local radio station",
      "Wow! Most surprised by the superb quality of the audio. Hands down best audio recorder.",
      "This app is very easy for me to use when I need to record some information quickly. Playback is good also"

      "Amazing. If you're into making music/songs..then bandlab is definitely for you. Even with a headphone mic you can record decent vocals. If you invest in a decent microphone the results are even better. Making beats is fun too. With lots of loops/samples and instruments to play around with. Or you can simply import an instrumental track that is stored on your phone. Takes a bit of getting used to.. But once you get to grips with things and learn how things work it's awesome.",
      "Well, I have not found a way to change the pitch of a track. For example, if i pick a MIDI instrument and lay out some chords that sound better lower, I have to manually transpose them. As for effects, search needs to retreive what the effect does instead of its name. Also, please add an ADSR envelope generator. This would be 5 stars if those are added.",
      "It's great and I am very happy with it. I had to delete it due to issues with my phone and now that I try to log in again, I am logged into an account with all of my projects gone. Either I am logged into the wrong account OR the projects were deleted somehow. The picture of me is not the correct one either, so I am guessing it is the former. How would I recover the correct account? Please help!",
      "... update.. I love the master effects. Uploading my own instrumentals is a big plus. From Mobile to Computer, to Mobile is the best. Great Job. I'm having trouble downloading my file, there are options, but it takes me to share options. That reason is for the 1 star, if I was able to have access to the raw file so I can use it for my video edit, yes. Great. Love how you let me change the pitch and speed of an existing project of mine.",
      "I have a phone that has no headphone jack, and when I try to plug in headphones by USB-c, it won't allow me to turn on audio monitoring. There is no delay or feedback if headphones connected by USB-c. Please help. I use Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. The headphones work fine, but it doesn't allow monitoring for some reason. Sometimes monitoring works with my wireless headphones. Also, in some rare times, it did work, but when I changed the orientation, it permanently turned off the monitoring."

      "Awesome application, especially the fact that you can get rid of ads by watching 5 videos!! Bro this is what we all need, developers who give you the option to have or not have ads, makes me want to keep the ads knowing I can get rid of them, I dont know, something about having options instead of being restricted makes everything well, besides that, the app itself is amazing, using it is a piece of cake, you can become a DJ with this if used the correct way!",
      "Dear Coocent, You have done a great job by making the only reliable and effective app for enhancing our experience. But as more and more devices are upgrading to Android 10, it tends to WORSEN the sound quality and bass! It no more works on ANDROID 10. It is a Serious Problem so please fix this As Soon As Possible! Please! I will be waiting for your reply!",
      "I thoroughly rely on this app whenever I have music playing ... Which is just about constantly Simple layout to make adjustments quick on the fly, Just enough UI tweaks to make it unique to my style and plenty of appropriately tuned presets to cover every scenario. Most notable quality for me above all else has been it's flawless service... Not a single error or crash to date for me so I gladly rate 5/5.",
      "By far, after a lot of test and trails, i can assure that this is the best app out of all the othe equalizer apps. This bass is boosted in a smooth way and doent distort the sound like the other apps. The best setting i would suggest is to set the EQ to Hiphop and turn up the bass upto 90+ . I use it with Sony bluetooth headphones, skull candy hesh and real me buds.",
      "Needs more powerful audio booster. And a 10-band equalizer. My systems boombox is better Yet both of them together. Sounds fine. I would not be able to use this without my systems built in one. And my separate volume booster. So yes, this needs work. But it's okay. And you should make it adjustable for other apps to play.

      "Running AEM on a Samsung J7 with a Roland Go Mixer and their USB Driver. Have issues with USB Audio after reloading a project - chatter, speed-up, (changing bus speed and rebooting usually clears thisb), and track bleed. Getting better at editing but the cell interface is tedious. Not their fault, just physically small, no mouse. Manual is ...not comprehensive. I'm glad I got it, but spent more time messing with it or emailing Davy than playing. In all fairness, a great DAW, I'm inexperienced.",
      "bought this app to live record a multitrack show of my band on a Fire 10 HD android tablet with a Behringer XR18(compatible). It allows the assignment of 16 mono inputs sequentially to each individual track but does not allow the assigning of mono outputs to the XR18 for multitrack playback for a virtual soundcheck. It only allows stereo 1-2, 3-4 etc for playback... assigning the channels to groups L-R pan unsuccessful as each stereo output can only be assigned to one group at a time. Too bad.",
      "Im recording with just a pair of headphones. I press record. It records for 1 minute and then stops recording my voice. The recording line literally just goes flat. Is this common and what can I do to fix it? (Galaxy S9).",
      "I generally prefer not using my phone for any music projects but when I do I've found this app to be the most flexible, most user friendly and most enjoyable of the many many I've tried. Very reasonably priced to boot.",
      "Hey guys, this app is solid. But I'm having some issues enough saving songs. I've saved multiple times, throwing in some \"save as\" as well, but it doesn't actually save. I've lost dozens of tracks. Just want to let you know, cause my experience otherwise is pretty dope. Thanks."

      "This is easily the best music player app I've found so far. It looks slick, the UI is exactly what I wanted, the lyric display works perfectly without being difficult to get working, the tag editor is simple and useful and the covers appear in beautiful high res. I can't recommend this app enough, if you're like me and you're tired of the garbage music player on your phone this is your best bet. I rarely say this but I'm honestly considering buying the paid version as well.",
      "Since I've downloaded it, it's been great. Only thing is it'll sometimes separate songs from the same album, making a duplicate of an album that was just created despite info (artist, title, etc) all being the exact same, meaning there's no reason for it to create a duplicate album. Very irritating new bug (as of 2/24/20) that also abruptly and randomly stops the music and restarts it from the beginning when I open the app.",
      "I cannot create or update playlists externally (iTunes) and then reload them onto my phone. I think that the latest Pulsar update (January 9, 2020) may have replaced the use of \"relative location\" of files on a playlist with \"absolute location.\" Now, every time that I reload an updated playlist (m3u file), Pulsar shows 0 songs in that playlist. Mirroring my folder hierarchy on my phone is not an option because I have the same song on multiple playlists (but in only one folder). When will this be fixed?",
      "Good App.. EXCEPT.. It's great when I'm actually on the app page, I can access the controls, but if I leave something playing, to do something else, then the music continues, but then there is no indication of the controls, no bar with the play /stop button, nothing in the notification bar. If I need to stop it quickly (phone call etc) I have to go back to the main page and look for the app icon to re-open it, to stop the music playing That cant be right. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.",
      "Almost perfect. It's stylish, featureful, and the ability to blacklist certian folders was a \"must have\" for me. However, I have one gripe that I would love to see remidied. When looking at the track list, you can't see the album art. Just a play button. This really slows down the experience. When someone is about to select a song, their finger covers to song title, so being able to see the album art, to ensure they select the right song is really convient."

      "*EDIT* I've been using my DS218+ for over a month now, and DS audio streams my music very easily through this app. The playlist feature is really nice, too. The only thing that's annoying is the app defaults to downloading songs you play, and the disable feature doesn't work. So when you select a song to play, it's automatically downloaded. When you try to disable automatic downloading, it doesn't work. Synology, you have a great device with sub-par apps...fix this.",
      "Mea Culpa, Synology audio app. I became frustrated with the Plex UI and decided to try DS audio again after my previous negative review. Either there have been big improvements with the app or maybe my wireless is more stable. I think the former. The app is much more stable now and very straightforward. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles I just want to select the song from my library and play it. DS Audio does that. Recommended.",
      "Imma give it 3 stars. Here's why: 1. A star off for adding all songs into the queue when you tap on a single song in the folder. You shouldn't need to use the 3-dot menu at the RHS of the track to select play. The default should be to instantly play the song you tap. Any fannying about with adding the entire folder or adding the track to the queue should be done through the menu. 2. Another star off for the widget becoming inoperable if you have exited the app. For instance, restart your phone and then tap on the widget, nada, nothing. You need to go and open the app first, log back in and then the widget is operable. If the app isn't running in the background then the widget should open up the app to allow sign-in. Being able to stream (and download if required) my entire music collection from anywhere I have a data connection is sweet AF tho'.",
      "Basic app, some easy wins would make it vastly better. Others have said it already: slow log in, poor functionality with Android Auto: it's not safe to browse while driving obviously, but even the \"recently played\" list doesn't update, and when you click on a song, it plays something else. Synology, you can do better!",
      "Synology software is generally great but this I'm giving only 2* for now to hopefully incentivise some work. a) I cannot see any way to prevent downloading or accessing libbary when not on WiFi - that is a massive bug/fault which could prove extremely costly and needs to be fixed pronto b) It was extremely difficuly to force downloads to go to SD card. Eventailly I figured out I had to actually *create* a folder from within the app rather than using an existing one."

      "I really like the simple and functional nature of this app, however I am having a pretty serious audio sync issue. I use this app to record my voice with a lav mic while I am taking to my camera and then I synchronize the audio/video in post. Unfortunately 1 out of my 4 audio tracks are unsyncable. I will sync the start of the video and it appears to be in sync for 30 seconds or so, but as the video plays the audio progressively loses sync. I have tried stretching the audio track and that helped a little, but the middle of the track is still not synced. I was recording with two mics/devices and fortunately the track that I recorded with the other mic was easy to sync, so that is also how I isolated the issue to my phone/ this app. Overall a good app for voice recording but USE WITH CAUTION IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO SYNC RECORDED AUDIO WITH VIDEO.",
      "Great! Does exactly what it's supposed to without any annoyances or ads. It supports state-of-art codecs like Opus and FLAC. I appreciate that it can skip over silence, encode on the fly, gives visual feedback during recording and can do longtime recordings. The interface is neat and clean. An exit button wouldbe nice because if you enable the lockscreen interface, the app be quit forcefully only. I'd pay or donate (Transferwise, LiberaPay, PayPal) for this in a heartbeat. Thank you very much!",

If it does, it's unclear how to do so, as there is a lack of instructions. If there's no way to utilise the app, the sole purpose of its existence is quite lost, regrettably. Looking at reviews, I am not the only person with issues regarding usage. I'll revise my review gladly to 5 stars if a solution is available. üôÇ",

This problem occurred in the recent update, never had this issue before, would give a 4 or 5 stars if not for this problem. The recently added songs are on my device(SAMSUNG A30) but is not recognized by the app itself, PLEASE FIX.",
      "What is it that I have to do to be able to click on the first song in an album, and then have it play the whole album in the right order? What is the arrows circling with an A in the center icon for? It only shuffles the currently playing album, whether I have shuffle on or not. This app didn't used to do that, so what happened? You consider \"Next song is not played in some models\" (in [16.2.21.6] fixes) to be an improvement? It seems like all kinds of weird random stuff is not working properly with this app, going off the other reviews. What happened to the quality we used to get with Samsung?",
      "Not good, the music suddenly just stops. I had a Samsung galaxy S5 and the music would play for a while then just stop, so I had to press the play button again, it happened very often, I assumed it was because I had an older model, I've just upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S10, I've downloaded this app and it does the same thing again, plays for 5 mins and then just stops, please tell me why Samsung?",
      "Up until yesterday, I've loved the seamless way Samsung Music manages music, especially playlists . However, after the most recent Android system upgrade, my playlists have been stripped of all their tracks.  The songs are still there, visible on my SD card,  but the most important part of the equation (the playlists) have disappeared. When will this problem be fixed? I'd be happy to give this app 5 stars once it resolves this issue",
      "Good app, nice UI interface for on-phone music but inflexible when it comes to selecting which music to include in your collection. It will select all music file types on your phone (including call recordings, ringtones, etc) and include them in your library with no capability of excluding tracks/folders. it's all or nothing. It's a shame since otherwise this is a very good interface for playing music. It will also link to Spotify (but you can't log into it) but no other streaming services."

      "Awesome! thanks. my phone started to think that headphones are unplugged. Now everything is fixed. (05.03.20)Edit: widgets are now a premium feature, now you need to go inside the app itself to switch. It's kinda strange and scummy in a way to downgrade apps and lock previously available features behind paywall. But it's still works flawlessly so... IDK, just disappointed a bit.",
      "WHAT A LIFESAVER. My headphones' mic suck so bad so all I wanted was to record using my phone's mic while listening through headphones. It was deemed impossible until I saw a comment in Quora suggesting this app. And it's a success! \"Switch microphone\" and choosing internal mic for both speakers and headphones did the trick. Thank you so much AudioSwitch!!! 5 stars for you!",
      "I bought a new phone that had a headphone jack issue (kept thinking headphones were in when they were not) & I couldn't exchange the phone in time so I was stuck with this issue. 5 minutes into videos it would think I'd have headphones in. Or during call I wouldn't be able to hear because of the headphone mode. This app have saved the day. It was worth the $5 to upgrade the app for the auto toggle. A lot of people are griping but I'm happy to pay for the features I need vs cost of a NEW phone.",
      "Not a review but a request for assistance. I have a Rode SC4 adapter which is designed for IPhone, directing audio directly from a mixer to the phone. I purchased this app to trick my android phone into allowing me to stream audio through the phone via the mixer. How can I set this up?",
      "This app is a livesaver. Once I got my headphones jack on my phone, I was on panic. I didn't know what to do, I searched through the internet to fix the problem but all of them didn't work. But I found a YouTube video that I need to download an audioswitch app and I found this. Thanks!"

      "Too many ads & Search engine cant find a single song. Search option should be able to find all songs in storage",
      "On LG Stylo (cheapest phone I could get), I hate it, but love this app. EQ DOES work and player functions as advertised. This could be my first official app purchase. (Yes I'm cheap and will not \"buy\" an app unless I am 100% happy). Ads do not interfere with functionality.",

      "Amazing! I use a bluetooh transmitter for audio away from my phone. Problem was, the reciever sounds thin and tinny. Before blowing money on a better BT reciever, tried this. Fantstic! Allowed me to adjust the thin sound to acceptable! Saved me from buying new hardware. Tried a few of these apps, but this one sounds best. I only wish I could pay for an ad free version. Great app!",
      "This app works incredibly well and the adds ig contains aren't invasive. They dont pop in everytime I use it and they dont stop me from doing what I do. Well timed and i can appreciate that. The app itself has the things that most boosters do but it has even more and the sound quality is good with my H20 mini Lifejacket. I've uninstalled others for that problem. I love it , thanks",
      "Works beutiful. Like th√© best wizard in th√© entire kingdom made this. üòÅüëç, I very highly recomend this if using your device originaly doesnt like producing high volume to you woofer and tweeter speaker system( mind you, i got my Logitech Z313 sound system from a thrift store for five bucks) because if my Android can NOW play it, then apple can, and you still have quality with this. I Hope yall enjoy this app, 'cause i do‚ö°üëçüòÅ",
      "this is seriously awesome!! the last few phones I've had hadn't had loud volume w/speakers or headphones so I'm like always trying 2 find an app that actually works & increases the volumes w/o distorting the sounds or anything & that's like exactly what I got w/this app. as soon as it's opened u can really customize the sound so it's louder & still sounds great thru speakers & headphones. & it disappears into background so u can still use phone regularly. thanks!! this is honestly a HUGE help!!",
      "Worst app ever. As soon as I connected to my Bluetooth speaker, played a song and opened this app, instead of the sound amplifying, it ended up damaging the sound on my phone. Now everytime I connect to my speakers, all I hear is tweeting sounds. I would never recommend this pathetic app to anyone. If I could, I would give this app negative ratings."

Also the gallery shows all music files including those on the SD card which is good, however the file browser won't show the SD card where my files are kept. Maybe if it did, I'd be able to select multiple files? I will change this review if I've missed something and it has the functionality I need.",

      "This app is great to use while I listen to music in the car. I don't even have to look at my phone to skip to a new song. I had trouble saving playlists, but I found that the app works with external audio apps so I can choose playlists from there anyway. It's very convenient to use and all controls are customizable. I would highly recommend this app for listening to music in situations where it is inconvenient to spend time looking at your phone. Otherwise, the capabilities are somewhat limited.",
      "The best thing about this app is I can use its swipe controls with ALL of my music apps. AND I CAN SET MY OWN SWIPE CONTROLS!!!! FREAKING AWESOME!!!! I immediately upgraded!!! Best app I've ever downloaded!!!!",
      "I am now experiencing silence (music stops play at 2nd or 3rd song. When bluetooh is connected to car. Only with Audio Swipe. Any recommendations?? I have to exit player... Then open up and restart it. Im not sure why it does it. Pause and then play doesnt fix it either. Can you help?? Thank you for the info! Is there an option to turn shuffle off? Every time i hit option for next track or skip it shuffles to a completely different artist. I cannot seem to be able to turn it off",
      "Hi Hendriksen Software! I just tried your Audio Swipe app on my Galaxy Note 8. WOW, WHAT A GREAT APP! I was so impressed with it's functionality, ease of use and ability to customize settings that I upgraded to the full version right away. There is one feature that I would like to see added to this app. That would be to have the the ability to tap or swipe on the screen, and open a voice search for a specific song, album or artist. Once again, GREAT APP!",
      "I love this app but all the sudden I can't swipe on dark mode when the screen appears to be off. I purchased the \"upgrade\" to have unlimmitted swiping and it still won't work. I only want the app for a safer driving expierence. So for other blondes like myself you have to use dark mode by long tapping the screen it appears off but it runs the app so you can swipe, use volume controls and pause/play your music. You can't enable the lock screen to use the app. Hope this helps someone!"

      "Personal opinion and experience? Okay. ¬£7 a week is steep, especially for a buggy app thats seriously unresponsive most of the time. If you dont pay youre bombarded with ads every 30 seconds, if you do pay it doesnt always upload your songs in time to mix so usually you have to restart your recording every time. I only use this app cause it can connect to deezer but with the experience with this app im now changing completely to spotify so i can use a different app entirely.",
      "Terrible, worst app I think I've ever owned, deleted after 30mins use. Cuts off your mix to play advertisements after each tract, will cost $700 a year to have the privilege of a no ad premium service.....no thanks!",
      "Words aren't enough It's the best dj app I ever get Once used it on an iPhone but on Android it's lit. I can't wait for the latest upgrade with ease of access esp on effects and samplers.",
      "LOVE IT!!! Automix is awesome as long as you prepare the tracks wright. A little glitch when tempo has to be adjusted but otherwise is ok.",
      "This app is the best app that you can find in the play store and it was so good and nice and it is not a bad dj mixs so this app is the best and my friends like this app so I'm telling you this app is so much fun and nice and the best part about it is that you have to go through the list to find more music for DJ so this app helps me to be a DJ so when I grow up I will be a DJ so this is why I'm telling this app is so good and it is not too bad . So this is why I'm telling you this app is."

      "The new updates are terrible. They make the product almost completely unusable compared to previous versions. It should not take 10 seconds or more to load a playlist, and I don't care how many tracks there are on the playlist. Playlists linger after I have tried to delete them. The only thing the updates have fixed is blank playlists showing up. That's still simply not good enough if the trade off is an app that lags so much you're considering using the crappy pre-installed app. Nonsense.",
      "Dysfunctional, Frustrating! Lame Settings. Paused video disonnects casting and begins playing on my tablet at a random time or another video! Timeline repeatedly vanishes and makes resuming video at select points frustrating and embarrassing (audiences). Highly over rated app. Does not play well on my Samsung tablet. Okay to watch a non-stop video but stop and go doesn't conform to a pleasant experience. Nothing like the computer version. Icon signifies that you should avoid this half baked app.",
      "I really love this app, I've been using it for a good 6 years now downloading it on every new phone I bought. Love the playback speed option, the ability to slow music tempo and keep the same tone of the song is a very nice feature, I just wish it kept the sound quality too. Other than that..its a very great app VLC",
      "Resize options are all the same aspect ratio, showing the same vertically stretched picture for lots of videos, except 3:4 which is not helping . Most 4K videos, mkv, gets stretched. HD movies also get stretched if I use another player, like YouYube, and then go back to VLC. Only way to fix it is to restart the box. That only fix HD though. Tried reinstalling, but no luck. It refuses to show black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Box is MINIX U1",
      "I love VLC. Had it for years on my PC. On the phone Ive stuck with it while it develops and improves. My only problems on the phone are two things. Firstly the auto volume reduction when it thinks the vol is too high. It would be great to disable this. Why ? Because I dont just feed it to headphones. I play back through a Hifi system and its annoying it randomly reduces the volume withiut warning. Two. The auto scrolling of file titles. Really, really annoying when they are long !!!!"

      "Wow!!  Just wow!!  A lot of work into this app.  Audacity for the phone!!  As far as I can tell, nothing else like this is out there!!  Only thing is confusion about the free trial and free version.  I downloaded the free version and it kept crashing when it opened.  Looks like you have to take a subscription for $1.99/month, and then you get a free trial for several days.  If you don't like the software, then just cancel the subscription before your card is charged.  This could have been explained better...‚Ä¶.  Also, the labels on the chart axes are a bit small for my eyes, but not really complaining much.  Unlike some reported, I had no problem reading files from my SD card.  I have a Moto G running version 7.0",
      "This app is good and have potential, but whenever i try to export my audio it crashes and hours of hard work vanishes in seconds‚òπÔ∏è",
      "I really like this app.its easy to understand the features of this app.I think you should rellasenthe free app of Doninn. I can't edit audio of length more than 3minute for the free version of this application .",
      "My Android (4.2.2) Can you fix this problem: When I press the application, the system said (Unfortunately Doninn Audio Editor has stopped). I really like this app, because it's almost like (Audacity.exe) and I've tried it on my friend's phone.",
      "Super quick, almost fully-functional. I love how it's literally almost Audacity but for your phone. The only glitch is that when you click Listen while adjusting something, it doesn't play."

Compressor tends to produce sections with suddenly much greater volume. Pitch and tempo effects cause excessive distortion.

      "This is the best app ever . Cos every morning my wife cook in the kitchen and if i need to but i cant reach it so i use this for my wife cos she sometimes not good hearing when i call her to give me the thing i cant reach it . For example if laying on the bed but i forgot something so i use this to help wife .its amazing app ever seen befote",
      "Exceptional! This app is like a studio at the palm of your hands, you can record sound, edit it, and download and guess what it? It's all free! Gone are the days were you have to spend 100s of dollars for equipment just to create audio. The sound quality is phenomenalüëå and that's just using the regular phone microphone, when you record your voice it automatically reduces background noise and you can hear yourself very clearly it's professional, I recommend if your making YouTube videos.",
      "Exceptional design comes with outstanding customer service (the referral system was broken for me after 4th share, but when I reached out, they added the extra sync minutes right away!)",
      "I love it! Wish you could edit the voice but oh well for those that do wonder it works without a charm and I recommend it",
      "It's really fun and easy to use, and when you're a singer/songwriter and I aspiration happens to you at any second, you need to be ready. This app really helps me. Thank you!"

Also, whenever I stop at a spot and play it again the line goes back a couple seconds and then you cants really edit anything right. Please fix this. It's getting frustrating to the point I want to delete this but this is the best app I have so far so please fix this.",
      "I've never had so much fun with an app that is incredible. I just wish it had more sound effects to amp up the audience. In addition is like to see when it links to YouTube as well.",
      "You should be able to edit a podcast with this app, like you can do on the iPhone version. Also, there's no pausing a track once you start listening to it. If you stop it then you have to start over from the beginning. that being said, I do use this app to keep track of which episodes I've uploaded and to track stats, and it works very well for those things.",
      "This iz a good app for starting and/or building a podcast. Definitely has its own flavor and personality for podcasting only.",
      "I can't say enough great things about this system. I recently releases my podcast TechTokPod and was amazed by how professonal this app was. And, it's free!

      "its a fine music app, i just wish there were some adjustments that could be made. for one, the orange color primarily used is ghastly and honestly painful on phones that use primarily dark mode. it would be nice to be able to change this color, or at least have a darkmode friendly setting. its also unfortunate that you are unable to choose song by letter, as you can in so many other apps. otherwise, it works as intended",
      "I like this app very much. It has a sleep timer that I use when I go to sleep and it helps me through the night when it stops. The shuffle algorithm goes through all the songs instead of select ones and I really appreciate that. I would rate it 5 stars if it allowed me to change the album covers, but other than that, this app is great!",
      "I like this music player app! I've tried over 20 players and this one is easy to use. I can easily access songs on my phone to make my playlist with this app, very little to no searching to find the songs I want! (I have over 5,000 songs on my phone, so having them arranged the way this app categorizes them makes it much easier for me!) Thank you for this app! One of the best free music apps I've tried!",
      "I give 4 for the so far performance for me is very nice. The UI is simple easy to use unlike the other mp3 apps were complex and annoying to use. This one is not hassle shifting from artist to album to songs to folder is readily on the screen so quick. I will give 5 soon if performance is constant. Ladies n gentlemen out there I recommend this app just what I have enumerated, experience it for utself, anyway it's easy to uninstall.",
      "I love this app! It is convinience to use and it really exceeds my expectation. What I love about this is there is no advertisements and there is an option what's to show and hide as well and folder scanning. Really love it!!! 5 stars Thumbs up to developer of this app!!"

      "Works just fine, allows my phone to control the Soundbar. I like that it can Auto-Connect ON startup so I can use the remote right away. However, a serious design flaw is that it stays connected after use, so if you start playing a video or something on your phone, it will play sound through the Soundbar. It should not do this automatically. It should only connect for remote control!",
      "I used this app without much problem for a few months. Now when I open it, the tutorial comes on when I open the app and I can't click on anything, it stays frozen on tutorial and I can't use the app... I tried to uninstall, reinstall, update my phone software, all to no avail. I have a s10e. I will change my review when/if I can use the app again.",
      "I had the same problem as others, getting stuck on the tutorial screen on my Pixel 2 XL. The navigation bar covers the button to exit the tutorial. My solution was to change my phones navigation setting to gesture. Settings > System > Gestures > System navigation > Gesture navigation. This removes the navigation bar and gives you access to the red bar at the bottom. Tick the \"do not show this again\" box and press exit, and you won't get the tutorial each time you open the app.",
      "I wouldn't know how great the app is. I've never been able to get put of the source screen. I recently updated my operating system so I'm thinking the app just hasn't been redeveloped for android 10. If that's the case anyone with the update shouldn't bother until the app has been modified to work with it.",
      "I had the same experience as Kim. I have the Note9, but with android 10 I couldn't get past the tutorial. Her workaround worked, but might be something for the app developers to consider. I have been using this app for years, as the remote for my soundbar stopped working months after I got it. It generally works well."

      "This is such a wonderful app!! My previous phone (LG V20) had all the equalizers you have here in it's default music app. One issue I've found is that the audio quality's much better when any song's playing in the background while I'm playing a game than when the song's in the background of any other non-game. Is this happening only with my phone? I've checked all battery and performance related settings and it's still the same. Give me an answer and I'll give ya the 5 stars you truly deserve",
      "I think this app is GREAT. Great job to the ones who made this app. I had an earphone with disgusting bass and all. Then I found this app, it's a big help to my earphone and the music it plays. Thank you soo much for this app. I'm only 15 but if I was a adult I would pay you so much money for this. Thank youuu.üòÇüòäüòä",
      "I appreciate the 3D Surround experience and the customizable EQ with a graphic effect in this app. But I have some concerns which are constantly disturbing me to enjoy this app. 1. The app closes the moment the phone screen sleeps. Really annoying. 2. To add songs to a playlist why not have a select tab to select whatever songs/folder to be added / deleted from the playlist tan go one by one. 3. There is no cross fade to enjoy back to back play. I am on full subs. Other apps work in sleep mode.",
      "P1500 for a lifetime license? you probably did not know root users can have much better sound experience than this thru viper4android.. and on playerstore only xplayer 3d can emulate that capability same clarity, 3d sound and good bass without root at half of your \"lifetime\" price.. i don't even feel the 3d virtual sound about this app and controls are very limited.",
      "Won't find local music in folders that the likes of PowerAmp and Omnia have no issues with, and there's no way to point the app to local music folders either. With much better options available this seems like a pointless app. In this case, MP3 and WMA audio files in a folder called \"Music\" with multiple sub-folders on an external SD card is completely ignored by Boom. The media is seen fine by PowerAmp, Omnia, VLC, GoneMad, Pi and is found by AZ Media Scanner."

      "It is a little non-intuitive in navigating to where your saved videos are stored. But then just select the video file and it immediately extracts the audio into one of three formats including .wav and mp3, and it extracts the audio portion FAST. It may do other things but this is how I have used it so far and it is GREAT! üôÇ",
      "Dude are you kidding me? There were so many vids that went through extremely convoluted steps just to get to the point where you could even think about extracting audio files. I did my first in literally at most 15 seconds from first opening the app. Well done üëèüëèüëè well done.",
      "Great. So quick to find my file, easy to select the exact time frame I want to extract and simple to choose what format I want this in. Love the speed, simple interface and quality of this - thanks so much",
      "Thus far I have been able to recreate at least 21 different videos. That is to say that the recreated version is of course without any sound. Thanks to the Audio Extractor! I have been able to complete my videos with an incredible ability to remove the original script and background music by simply just lowering the volume to zero. Prior to those steps, waiting in the balance is the music that I felt would be most suitable for the recreated videos.That flawless ability comes from Audio Extractor",

If you delete the files from WhatsApp or from a file manager, they can't be recovered by the app.\r\n\r\nOpus Player was born as a simple audio player for the opus format, but now it is something more.\r\nAs most audio players, you can start it in your file manager, but differently from the others, you can choose the audio output, selecting the main speaker or the earpiece (the speaker for the voice call). It is useful if you don't have a headphone with you.\r\nOpus Player is compatible with most file explorers on Google Play.\r\nMoreover it provides a lot of features for managing your audio messages such as deleting, sharing and organizing, that make it the best audio manager for WhatsApp's voice notes.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-SHARE THE AUDIO ON FACEBOOK: Opus Player is the only app that lets you share an audio as a Facebook post, a WhatsApp status or an Instagram story.\r\n\r\n-CHOOSE THE AUDIO OUTPUT: you can switch your audio output between the standard multimedia and the voice call's speaker. Use it if you have problems with the proximity sensor when using WhatsApp.\r\n\r\n-USE IT WITH WHATSAPP: if you listen a voice message through Opus Player, the sender will not know you‚Äôve listened it. Just long press on the WhatsApp VNs, press on the share button and select Opus Player.\r\n\r\n-WHATSAPP VOICE NOTES HISTORY: Opus Player takes a history of all your voice messages, received and sent, and it shows them to you in order of date, giving you the possibility to easily find an old voice note and share it with other apps.\r\n\r\n-ORGANIZE IN CATEGORIES: you can create a category, giving it a name and an image and associate to it all the audio messages you want. After created the categories, you can filter the voice notes choosing to show only those belonging to one or more categories. Moreover you can delete all the voice notes in a category with only one click. \r\n\r\n-RENAME THE VOICE NOTES: you can change the name to each audio message without worrying about the compatibility with WhatsApp: the name is stored and shown only in Opus Player, without modifying the file, in order to avoid problems while running on WhatsApp.\r\n\r\n-SET A TEXT NOTE: you can relate each vNote to a text note, maybe for summarizing the content of the audio or for taking note of who is the sender.\r\n\r\n-MULTIPLE SELECTION: you can select multiple voice messages received in a day and you can perform different actions on them:\r\n  -delete\r\n  -share\r\n  -add to a category\r\n  -set an icon\r\n  -set a text note\r\n\r\n-SELECT THE FOLDER: you can manually select the folder in which Opus Player must search the .opus files. You can select the Telegram folder (Telegram\\Telegram Audio\\) as well. Just remember to select the \"select the ogg files\" option, because it uses the .ogg extension instead of .opus, and \"use file's date\", because it doesn't save the date in the name as WhatsApp does.\r\n\r\nWhy download Opus Player:\r\n\r\n- it saves you time when you need to find old voice messages;\r\n- listening the new received voice notes directly from the app, WhatsApp will not be notified and the blue ticks will not be shown;\r\n- you can share the voice messages on the main social networks: create Facebook and Twitter posts, share on WhatsApp status and on Instagram stories.\r\n\r\nFollow the updates on the Facebook page:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OpusPlayer/\r\n\r\nIf you have any problem or even any tips, please contact us to little.pako87@gmail.com or directly write on the Facebook page.",

      "I'm a huge fan of this and the music player, but since Android has updated so much since 2012 (the last time MortPlayer was updated) things have gotten unstable. I still use it to play single files at night since I haven't found another app which will stop after one file plays. I do wish he'd come back and do some updates for the new Android versions, but I'm afraid that's not going to happen. Strangely, I chose these apps based on the name (he's a Terry Pratchett fan, as am I), but it's been a great choice for many years. Here's hoping for an update.",
      "This app was my go-to for years if I ever wanted to listen to audio on my phone. However, like many others said, it now crashes constantly. I'm now at the point a file cannot play for more than a minute or two before randomly stopping Too bad this app seem to go the way of the graveyard. It never used to crash, was easy to use, and always kept great sound quality of the files it played. The problems only began to appear about a month ago, at least on my end. Let's hope this app can be saved",
      "I've been using this app for years. It's by far the best audio book player I've used or seen. Has a sleep timer, optional ads even on the free version although i paid, it's not expensive and totally worth it. You can set up different folders for audio books and music if you have files for both. Excellent app!",
      "So sorry to have to let this one go. I've been using this app for about 7 years, and it's the best app for audiobooks by far. But in the last few months it's started to crash heavily. It's just about unusable now, crashing every time you try to change books. Considering the last update is listed from 2012, I've given up hope that it's going to be fixed.",
      "This app used to be my go to app for audiobooks, but recently it crashes all the time. I've lived with that for a few weeks, hoping it would be addressed, but I think it's time to move on to something a bit newer and more stable. I've tried several alternatives and, although Smart is good, l think Listen has the edge.."

I'm always on the look out for better/Faster Quality and for the past 5 years, I still Haven't Found a converter app better than this one!! AND IT'S COMPLETELY FREE! Thank you Developers for a great App that does exactly what you say it does and it does it the fastest with no quality loss either..... P.S. ( I AM NOT PAID TO GIVE THIS REVIEW ) JS.....",
      "Downloaded it and realized immediately you have to download videos first. Then you can use this software. It is the responsibility of the developer to disclose this. But they don't for obvious reasons. Uninstalled. There is software that saves this step by using links instead. Obviously far superior and sincere.",
      "works on every device I've used it on one or two niggling little problems but that's just me trying to be clever apart from that everything is as it should be keep it up and don't mess it up PS it works perfect and long videos I have used it it on videos of over 12 hours with no problems at all",
      "The app does a very good job, and I've been using it for about 4 years now. But I realized that you can't set the initial and ending time where you wanna convert. For example a song video may start with a conversation which you probably don't want to hear on the audio you convert. Otherwise, It's good. : )",

It does everything it says in description, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because SOMETIMES it doesnt list ALL the songs. other than that its good! the app is light weight, but the update takes 17mb of storage space before update 14 mb, besides that it doesn't drain the battery too quick. I can play music while I'm surfing the internet which is a PLUS for me. The sound is excellent, the equalizer helps, and no AD'S! thank you!",

      "Too difficult to use. Spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out hot to use it without success. I installed Video to MP3 Converter app (for video or songs) and in about less than 5 minutes I was already converting WMA format to MP3. They do better job than you do, developers! This app's rate is 4.0 while the other one has 4.8 so you are lame!!!! No need to contact no team support. Too difficult to use. Just make it easier like other apps. Get your head out of your asses!",
      "No External Drive Support...is a fail off the bat. Like, im sure someone uses local storage for media..., but there isn't a app category that is more likely to leverage external storage, e.g., SD, or even attached, than photo/video and audio. So HOW on earth, THIS app doesn't have that built in is not only an epic fail, it calls into question the entire product and program management competence. I cannot even TRY, and not sure I trust enought to BUY, if i could use it successfully.",
      "Excellent, easy to use software. Very impressed. Highly recommended.",
      "I was looking for an app to convert batches of .ra files to mp3. This does exactly that (and much more) so as far as I'm concerned, bingo. OK it does take forever but hey it's free and it works and it's easy to use so it's all good.",
      "If i use Vbr to convert wav to mp3 with minimum 320 and maximum 320, 0 quality (highest) and with joint and CRC checksum, i imagine i would get the best quality mp3 output file format because I'm basically forcing the highest quality on both ends of the scale. Whatdya reckon ? ü§î"

You can drag them to change but it's not permanent once I switch lists. Haven't even been able to figure out how it sorts as it's not been alphabetical or file sized. I have 594 songs so I'd like to order them to my preference permanently in lists. Otherwise,no complaints & this is the only player I kept & use! If I'm missing something plz let me know!",

      "Wow! Super easy to use. So far so good, and it does everything it says it does in the description. I quickly converted a flac file (approximately 2 minutes long) and it did it in less than 10 seconds! Super cool & convenient. The only feedback I have is that I wish it were a little easier to press play and listen to each file instead of tapping the upper right corner menu and then pressing play. I hope this app continues to work and produce great content as an audio tool! Thank Bdroid Team!",

      "This is straight an honest review i would of gave this app 10‚òÜs if it was possible.. but just on the soul fact that you only have a 3 min audio time frame is ridiculous!! I mean i can understand the cant change the pitch past 3 unless u upgrade. I mean wants to make money from their work.. but can't go pass 3 min of audio time?? That's just greedynes and bad salesmanship.. if the audio time frame is ever changed. Ill give a 5‚òÜ and praise the app. But until then uninstalled just on principle..",
      "Bandlab you did it again!!! I find it amazing as to how this studio music app works. It's great when trying to find the right tempo and pitch to create wonderful sounds, or place perfect ad libs over a track you have already produced to give good quality sound and flavor to your music. Combined with bandlabs music studio. It's like having a real studio in the palm of your hands. Five stars is not enough for this app. The rating should be Ten stars.",
      "Cool but you have to pay $10 if you want to listen to an audio clip longer than 3 minutes. Why say it's free if they literally stop the music 3 minutes (exactly) into the audio",
      "Would consider purchasing if you improved the import speed. Are you using FT O(n^2) instead of FFT O(n Log[n])? Also the file picker is frustrating. Otherwise impressive.",

      "Nothing as advertised. Bummer! Sound same regular as CD quality. No way to buy pro version or get rid of ads. Won't let me share, says error, try again later. Bad format and overall display, bad. Settings has just one change, regular to CD quality. It DOES record but that's all it does. Appears author didn't put too much thought into giving us a new, better recording experience. Maybe this review will inspire author to go back to the drawing board and give us a better, must-have mouse trap.",
      "The app is simple amd nice to use. I love it. But it would have been five star if there is a pause button during recording. I suggest you include pause button during recording in the next update thanks.",
      "For me,it's about the best recording app I have used, my intention was to simply try it and stop my subscription but I couldn't once I have tried it, it's that good, I recommend this for everyone, thanks developer for a job well done,",
      "It's nice, but make a provision to cancel in case of a mistake when recording. Also add option of arrangements if previous recording either alphabetical order or as and when recorded with reference to the date.",
      "Very very poor recording format. it only records one minute and leaves the rest. So much disappointing"

      "Excellent app, superb for learning parts and phrasing. Simple easy to use interface, it would be great if a drum loop could be played evenly without glitching at the end of a loop but I believe that is due to the poor latency inherent in the android and iOS operating systems. Super app though, Thanks. UPDATE **********TEN STARS I found a way to fine tune the drum loops and with incredible help and communications from the developer made it work. Superb faultless service. Many, many thanks.",
      "Just what I need for transcribing music. Additionally bonus that you can save the fragments and don't have do over again at a later time.",
      "Hi I love your app but was wondering is their a way to adjust the volume without affecting other volume apps? For example in the party mixer app you can make the volume alittle lower and then go on YouTube and the two apps have separate volume controls.",
      "Amazing app! I can loop what I need to with zero issues. I have been using this for months now.",
      "Loops audio files for continuous play in background. Perfect for auto suggestions and affirmations. 10/10"
