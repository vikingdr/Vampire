      "This app is appalling! It used to work great and as I use this on a daily basis to get new work on through google i am furious today as for some reason its lost all of my customers messages which i had yet booked in and now have no way of contacting them!!! You can't change the quote page to add customers phone numbers etc and when you change your device which i did last month you loose all of the messages between you and the customer which effects our business massively. I need someone to contact me urgently to tell me how i get those messages back as i may of lost a days work!! I was in the middle of booking a customer just and now they will assume I do not want their business as i can't contact them. The app used to forward their email address and phone number why did this change? We use google business daily to add posts for clients to see and book customers and honestly this is a joke.",
      "Every day I get messages that my business info is updated. I am not making changes. I've talked to customer service but they won't fix the problem. Mostly because they say there is no problem. So, either they're letting someone spam my account or it's just terminally broken and costing me business.",
      "So, there's like no way to access messages... seriously inconvienct. However I am getting calls for my business which is the goal, I'm sure not as many as I could be but it's a good start, but when I click on messages it keeps telling me to install the app, like, yo, I am on the app! How you gonna tell me to get the app when this IS the app.... terrible. Google, you supposed to be like all powerful.... fix this!!",
      "Useful but painful. Has no integration between multiple locations of the same business. Each common problem has to be dealt with separately for each location. Has no option to categorize photos based on events or pin posts or inform customers of other locations. It's very useful to have this app, but everything is just far more trouble than it should be. Equilibrium Fitness",
      "This is my second review of this app. I have never been this frustrated with an app. If it worked it would be perfect but this app does not work. I never get notifications. Clients message me and it takes days to update me. It seems to experience challenges connecting to the internet. The worst part is that there Isn't an alternative. I wouldn't think twice of switching."

      "Seriously need to improve. While playing a perfectly going game with no issue, it will say that you missed a chance and taken out of room. I mean, what? We were playing nicely and you do it. It's irritating. Secondly, in online game, if no one shows in 20 seconds they will automatically set us with computer, if we want to play with computer, we would do it by computer mode but no, you will give us computer. 1 more thing, u should give sort of coin to avoid leaving players and bet in between them",
      "While playin the game it suddenly removes you out from the game. And the computer starts taking over and starts making bad choices with the other people on the game. Why is this glitch there. Fix it. And also it should give is any option to just pass the property instead off just forcing for a auction.",
      "Great work with few suggestions. I would like to play only with the real players but not with system. So can you keep an option to play with only real players let it be 2,3,4 but not with system. Good that you have customized the chat, it was horrible. Even the other player is having negative balance, he is able to buy the property and build houses.",
      "I used to love this game but after the recent update, this game has became the worst . Whenever i want to play with my friends, at the middle of the game i lost connection and my game just shut off. Moreover, my money in the game shows different to every other player. Eg: If i have more money, it shows minus money on my friend's game and then i lost connection and i would be bankrupt. It happened for about 4-5 times. Disappointed with the new update",
      "Playing this game gives us a nostalgic experience, mostly playing with bots even in online mode. I presume once more players use this app it will be eliminated. One request is to change the rules of directly sending you to lobby if you miss two chances. Overall it's fun , when you are with your friends join with them in friends mode and have fun"

      "Good app for online business owners or anyone who accepts payments through a PayPal Business account. The search function could be better, but I can normally find the specific transaction I need within a minute or two. You can give partial or full refunds directly from the app, which is something the normal PayPal app does not allow. Another nice feature is the Sales Insights page where you can view your total sales and easily compare figures by the month, quarterly, yearly etc.",
      "This app is really simple & great for the cost. Although I had a few issues that took a while to clear (especially with all that is happening with COVID19) over all I am more than satisfied.",
      "I'm sure it would be great if it ever let me log in via the app. I can log in and out with the same details all day online. Try with this app and computer says no.",
      "Very convenient and easy to use. I love that the items and descriptions are there and saved and All the customers info saved as well. Thank you. It's easy for customers to pay and easy to use."

      "It was 5 stars, since I was enjoying it, everything is going well and I keep on levelling up, currently on level 5. Until I needed to delete it to be reinstalled in a couple of minutes. Then when I reinstalled it, I was back to level 3. I spent days playing it even spent some money because I really love playing it. But very disappointed of what happened. Other players, be careful of deleting this game. You might lose your games and just waste your time and even money. Such a waste. Still up tho.",
      "Good concept but heavily flawed and buggy. You cannot advance in the game without gold coins. I'm practically stuck at level 6. You're supposed to get one free gold a day. I've played every day but have not gotten my daily coins. Also the free coins you do get mysteriously disappear with no rhyme or reason. Yesterday when I logged off I had 9 coins, today when I logged in I have 6. I'm not buying coins if the free ones aren't accounted for correctly.",
      "It is fun but the fact that u don't earn actions and just a tiny amount of gold coins to progress sucks. I think the game should give gold coins according to what is required to actually play the game like they can give u 3 gold and to fill actions bar it takes 25. U need to spend real life money to actually be successful in this game",
      "Great game, really enjoyable. Personally I think action time needs to be addressed every 30 minutes does make it super slow to begin with Lots of potential, gold coins are hard to come by for a non pay to win scenario. You should be able to purchase with both gold and in-game cash the account for example is a massive game changer",
      "Great game few issues but am sure theyll be ironed out in the future, takes some time to get into but is a good game to check in on once or twice a day Edit: didnt receive 10 coins for the raiting as you said i would, if unintended please add coins to the account if intentional then the rating will significantly drop."

      "The game would be fun, but several drawbacks cause me to rate it as only a star. I downloaded this and started playing, and after 30 minutes of playing, rather trying to play, I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing. Everytime I go to start a new project, there's lots available. They all look the same besides profits, confusing. Your entire card system doesn't make any sense. Maybe make the time go slower, or at least be able to pause, so players can take a second to strategize.",
      "I feel like there should be more to it than just gaining and loosing money.... For instance, when developing an app to start the business,i thought it'd be cool to have a dialogue (or option) of how you want the app to be.In so doing, you'll have to live with the choices you make. It doesn't have to be sophisticated, just something that would add flare to the game. A business choice based game ,now that sounds interesting,i hope you do consider my suggestion. Thanks👍",
      "It's a good game but you need to make it more dynamic. For example you have to constantly update the dialogs of the employees. And you must introduce some new characters. And you must make some challenges in the game and give some free diamonds and stuff.",
      "I liked it for a bit but then when I was saving up for a new office but suddenly my money was dropping really quickly. I didn't know how all the game said was \"you are losing money promote your business, but I didn't know how",
      "Good job. Bad UI. If this were a PC game there would be fewer problems...but most of my time was spent fighting the controls rather than using them. For instance when you try and scroll through the cards, you're probably going to tap on a card making it try and drag the card rather than scroll the list. There's also no pause button so you can't check out your cool new cards."

      "Dont like new update The old ver. was easier 2 read, better than reading from websites. The update is slower, lost the flexibity of the old app. Just a soon read web pages, no benefit 2 the new app. Really slow. Really sucks.Still buggy, laggy, looses internet connection ? & STOPS. Like the old 1 better. Still glitchy, keeps saying No Internet connection but i have wifi&4g on. Doesnt scale properly. Pics too large. This app has gone down hill, now they're converting 2 Subscription based, LMAO!!",
      "Worst experience from the past six months. The app interface changes often and sometimes it shows half baked news. In addition to all of this, I can find a lot of grammatical and spelling errors in the articles. I am giving one star not for the news but the way you are presenting them.",
      "Have been reading BI for a number of years and now that quality of content has gone way down and sponsored ads seem to be more than 50% of content., they are trying to transition to a paid app. Good luck with that.",
      "Total Rubbish. Links take up to 30 seconds to open, and sometimes never open. Sometimes ALL the different links go to the same page."

      "Awesome until.... I was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar. This app had some features that made it better than Google calendars. That is, until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment. Now when I save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad. I didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker.",
      "Have been using the old Pro version on all my previous devices for years and liked it very much. Just started to use this new one not long ago. It has a more contemporary design, simplified and streamlined options, but the change in drag n drop in weekly view costs it a star. Both this and the old Pro version take almost 10 secs to launch on my new Xiaomi phone. That costs another star.",
      "It has been six months since my purchase of pro version of this app and I am writing this review as gratitude to the developers. Though, many of my favorite features have been added to default Google calender app, this one still is my default. The diversity and configurability of widgets has been of particular help to me in managing my personal and professional tasks. Another feature that I had used extensively is feature of repeated tasks, that have helped me in forming few good habits.",
      "One or two minor hiccups when inserting advance appointments which resulted in a difficulty with getting the diary back to 'todays' date. I had to turn the phone on and off in order to correct this. Also had problems with the app widget failing to download after the phone has been turned on. Other than those issues the diary has been great. I would love to have more options to customise the appearance of the app, eg background or page colour options only work when you insert an appointment.",
      "meh I left the \"meh\" on 2/2019. Today is 3/2020. While the calendar is ok, the \"themes\" never change and, really, are not anything of interest. They really need to be completely changed. Also, color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things I have going on...the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are TOO FEW & what?! No pink?? (A nice hot pink so it will stand out). I mean, idk, I'm still just meh... 😕"

      "Seems app almost working as should - no way to mark all items in inbox as \"read\". It would be good to add option to be able sign in with multiple accounts. We have 2 businesses and 2 accounts with Yelp, it would be nice to use them same time. Another suggestion, implement custom templates for customer respond. For example, we have about 12-15 standard responses, it would be nice to be able to insert them by keyword, or selection. Thank you.",
      "We have been having trouble communicating through the app with our customers for a month now and it's causing us to lose business amongst other issues. Sine we are paying you guys, we would like to know what seems to be the problem with the app? It's very rare that we don't receive 10 - 20 error messages. This has become highly annoying and frustrating.",
      "I love the app but don't like how they randomly take down 5 star reviews always conveniently after you just tell them you don't want to upgrade your service. They deny it however Everytime right after a phone call from their sales department, we watch out 5 star reviews start to dwindle. They really have you in a grip that you can not do anything about.",
      "By far the very worst thing to use to try to advertise your business with. You will get Bill's for ads you didn't approve and the customer service and/or support is completely useless. $400 bill in one month for absolutely nothing. You are better served using any of the other advertising apps compared to this one"

      "Overall the app works great. If I could change one thing, it would be to stop listing discontinued items, or at least default them to the end of the list. For example, if I open the page of XS drinks and filter out the pallets, the first listings show discontinued. But they aren't really discontinued, they just have new item numbers. It looks sloppy. If I want to show someone our products, I don't want the first things they see to be \"discontinued.\""

      "The experiential learning through the app is a better way of imprinting information than staring at a video or even sitting in a lecture. I'm just about to start the Free MBA program so I'll update later with thoughts on the content, but the intro courses are good primers, albeit not new material to most with finance or managerial backgrounds.",
      "This is the best Online Course I've ever opt for, it is designed with the great effort. I am astonished to see the color combination in the application. The color are such chosen that they increase the efficiency of the brain. Every concept is explained with the help of real world example, and there is a real case study at the end of every chapter to analyse whether you understood the concepts or not. I am looking forward to complete my eMBA from Quantic Business Course.",

I need a report that show me the products that I sold to a customer (reciveables & paid), quantity and amount for each product.. same thing for products.. i need to know who bought this product (rec & paid), quantity and amount. Finally, most customers pay their loans later on 2 or 3 payments so I should distribute the amount of the payment on each folio.. I need accounts for customers",
      "I love the app. I suggest you add calculator to the purchase for easy calculation. Secondly if we can know our profile on every sale's without opening reports for easy discounts for our customers. Thirdly I have been trying to share with another phone through backup and restore and is not responding well thanks",
      "Great app, I have just started with few days ago, but it seems like there is no options for me to control the total stock in values or currency not in the amount of the products, like I said may be I am here to find the option yet. But so far I confirm it , to have been a great app.",

Yeah thats right... your transfers will go through compass bank and then azlos. So if you don't mind waiting a ridiculos amount of time for your money.",
      "It is an okay system but limits B2B transaction. Therefore if you have two business accounts for your organization you would need a personal account to deposit funds into your Azlo business account. That is not truly the best approach for a small business trying to keep personal finances from the business finances.",
      "For a free app and business account, you can't go wrong. Yes, you have to wait a few to 4 business days for your check to clear. I'm my case I am not demanding so Azlo is perfect for right now.",
      "No real benefit and lots of limitations and issues. Going with free business checking from bigger name is so much easier than dealing with a pre-mature banking system like Azlo. The app has basic options, but far from being a full featured app like what you get from big name banks.",
      "I love banking with them very easy to use and I was able to do instant transfers. I love it"

      "You can use a simple strategy to win, the game is quiet predictable. You could build use machine learning to see Stock markets and how they behave and maybe improve the game a bit. At any rate, I spent the whole day playing this game and its really interesting (I would say educational to some extend). :) Σ",
      "A good attempt. A few points to note though. Buying stock keeps the stock from climbing up to the initial values. It always sticks to low 100s which reduces the dividends. Also, found a glitch. If I repay my bank loan and the value turns -1, then I cant draw another loan nor can I repay anything. If these can be fixed, it can be an interesting game",
      "I enjoy this game but I wish for a couple of changes in an update for example the addition of an overdraft that goes up as your credit score does as when you have say 100 gold you Brought at 13k the economy crashes your holding it as golds gonna rise but I get declared bankrupt. Also make it optional on how much you have to get before the age limit.",
      "Very interesting game for sure. Ads are very limited and not very disruptive. The market pattern is about the same as real life but it is a bit too easy. Oh I'm playing easy level and got my Billion at age 33. From here definitely can learn, how rich gets richer. Will try harder level and yes, i recommend this game!",
      "This game is very addictive, beat the game at age 44. Time to take this game to another level. This game has a real life point to it which i love. The more real life you make it the better and more popular this game will be. Plus you should add some real life tips on investing to game great job guys."

      "Initially I was quite happy, especially about the possibility to learn offline and the audio-only mode. What the app does not cope with is a SLOW network (think: hotel lobby); it becomes completely unresponsive, sometimes locking the whole mobile phone. I have also had \"loss\" of already covered content. As for features, i would badly want to zoom into content (pause, then zoom in). Many DevOps courses contain videos of commanline interactions that are simply unreadable on a mobile!",
      "Not a seamless experience. Whats the point of downloading if you can't watch video's when in no internet area.After downloading video's should work without internet. Also you can't juta switch between laptop and mobile. Progress of the course should be Same at all login of Same user. We should be able switch easily. One more observation , if you cast this on Chromecast most of the time videos don't automatically move to next.You have to select it manually. Offline feature is useless.",
      "Please do proper testing before launching an app update.. Video are unable to play while connected WiFi networks. Only for few minutes of videos will play. Once I connect to chrome cast. But whenever I open. By default its searching for chromecast. Please fix bugs.",
      "Very good app, with options to download lessons offline and a fine layout. I would like more options to cast screen directly from the app to a TV or chromecast. Now I have to use my device's miracast capabilities, but that is not optimal",
      "Playing back offline videos with data connection turned off doesn't sync progress even after reconnecting data, one needs to be always online to sync progress, which is a bummer. Plus the app doesn't remember the last playback position of a video."

      "Whatever you do do NOT sign up or create a subscription through the app or the Google Play Store - you have no ability to manage your subscription or upgrade your account through the app and quickbooks customer support is unable to help or change settings as well. I am very competent with navigating apps and I can say with 100% confidence this is on the app developers at this point - extremely frustrated and unhappy with the app",
      "It's amazing how far behind the times this company is. The only way my bank will allow me to link to Quick Books is by using my routing and account number, but QB doesn't know how to do it that way. This is crazy! So I need to switch banks just so I can link my expenses with QB. What a pain in the ass.",
      "6.10.19 - i hate it. you can't do \"billable\" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19 - still hate it. noone has \"investigated\"my situation. 👎👎 12.5.19. yup.. still hate it. I use it but cringe every single time I open it. POS app. 1.3.20 still hate it no \"billable button\". Zero stars 3.5.20. still hate it. Zero stars",
      "Tried to open an account, somehow ended up opening 2 separate ones. Cancelled my subscription but has still charged for the 2 accounts for over 2 months. Absolute shambles. I tried to use the one account that I actually wanted but had absolutely terrible service off the helpline, nobody knew what to do. Shocking.",
      "paying $20 a month for an app that keeps crashing that rely on for our business is nerve wrecking. please fix asap. Have tried app from two different computers to make sure it wasn't from my end."

      "I started out with a simple word that I wanted a little more clarity on and from there, I realized there's a lot of business terms I am not as savvy about as I would like to be. For me, this app is about as addicting and time consuming as a game app, but the plus is that...at the very least, I am getting smarter.",

      "OBNOXIOUS, OBNOXIOUS, OBNOXIOUS. I've used this app for years, and suddenly there are LOUD, OBNOXIOUS ads that pop up. I can't shut them up and get out of them by pressing Back or Home. Ads are annoying, but if you're going to have them, at least have silent ones that we can get out of. I also don't like how lately I can't edit \"only this event\" on a lot of recurring events. It's been fine for years, but suddenly it has issues.",
      "Until a week or two ago, Business Calendar was the best free Android calendar. But, since the latest update, it displays noisy full-screen adverts in the middle of a quiet office, and disables my Home and Back keys so that I can't stop them. This is half a step away from malware. I'm now looking for a new calendar. I think I've settled on aCalendar. It's a pity; I haven't found a replacement that's as good as Business Calendar used to be.",
      "Doesn't sync. At all. Period. It used to sync, but only if I told it to manually. But recently even this has stopped working. If only syncing happened automatically and *frequently*, this would be by far the best calendar app of the pack. Pro tip: Add a fortnight-view mode to really blow the competition out of the water (because literally none of the other calender apps have one...)",
      "We have used this app for many years and loved it! Lately it is not syncing correctly and is dropping appointments. We are looking for a new calendar. Let us know if you get things fixed. Also not enjoying pop up ads in the middle of scheduling people.",
      "Same issues as others mentioned recently. The new apps are horrible! No back button or home button to get out. Very loud and annoying! Need to find another calendar app. Sad, it's been my go to for years. Don't Install unless they remove the ads!"

When I access to the Report, it always pop up the tab (@top show name of report) and (@bottom for adjusting page)when I scrol up or down or just touch mobile screen. It's very inconvenient to be used via mobile because of these header (too big and useless). Wish you adjust this point",

While the community helps, half the solutions are twisted in their logic and half the tickets end in microsoft employee responding \"you can request this feature.\" We are moving on.",

      "Update: from 2 to 1 star no longer syncs Used to be my go to app ever since the update I can no longer share emails, web pages, or anything to a task list, now it force closes constantly in addition to no longer having ANY control at all in the task order. Randomly reorders my tasks as I'm moving a task on my list it moves it right back. If I'm lucky it might stay there for a short while before it either deletes or reorganizes the entire thing. I've lost a lot of time and info at work today.",
      "Ok but would be a lot better if it listed tasks in the same \"my order\" (manual order) as that on google itself. It also goes crazy and flickers every once in a while when exiting back to widget/home page. I'm not too bothered about the latter but the ordering of tasks is very important to me as I have some long lists!",
      "Was a great application but now synchronization doesn't work with Business Calendar Pro application. Also unable to delete a task list.",
      "Indispensable for me, but persistently rearranges my tasks and moves subtasks to the wrong tasks. Frustrating! Also does the flickering stuff mentioned by others."

If you have a continuous discussion when in and out of the office, you cannot see your exchange on the desktop when on your mobile, and vice versa. 2. The quality of your call varies: not so good when on mobile internet, but really good when over a stable broadband. A couple of times a crucial call from our executive was so broken up, I had to ask his EA to call me on mobile.",

Microsoft is pointing the finger at Chromebook support.",

This stinks!",

      "Good game! But needs more content. One glitch is when selecting your 3 focus strategies, the name of the strategies are either blank or random characters with only few showing full correct name. It's not a 1 time thing, happens everytime",
      "Decent game. It is way too short and appears to be a marketing game for your stencils website if anything. It would be better if you could do take overs if business, maybe play real world style play too. It just has no structure or rewards for anything",
      "Very cool and fun game. Only problem; once you get to a certain point. The game just ends. There's almost no more improvements you can make.",
      "Always say that there is another strategy upgrade..but there is no uprgade at all and i have to wait for how long?",
      "Game is okay, I get the concept and the features and graphics are great, some bugs tho and also needs a little change because you're trying to build an empire but you have no idea what you're selling so you have no idea how to price or how to strategies properly so it's more like guess work and trying to find hidden trends to build your business."

      "Edit- I have contacted you, many times, spent hours on live chat. Haven't had a reply since January when you said you the developers were trying to resolve the issues Yes I do have them turned off, another feature of your app that I pay for that doesn't work and I have to do manually. Cannot send invoices via sms at all now either.",
      "I down graded my subscription but I already have to many clients saved so won't even let me do one invoice. Money for nothing can't even use. This app is now useless. I want my money back.",
      "This is one of the shittiest invoice apps I have ever used. Two and a half years ago, it was great. Since these bozos updated it, it runs slow, and I mean real slow, and you have to hit about 40 buttons to do what used to take one or two actions. Now that the app has recently updated, it has got even worse. It really does suck more and more with every single update. Even with a Wi-Fi connection, as you begin to search for the client's name and the program is thinking, it starts erasing letters.",
      "It works but , I paid for a basic service as don't need more but to many push msg to buy full version Can't clear history so when I inputting same expense ,have to change manually every time cos price has changed If I make mistake at first line, I can't change it once it's been saved, so have to delete everything and write again ? You should do better",
      "Cannot log in at all, can't contact support directly. I need to get into the app to check an invoice and send a new one. One device I have been logged out of and password won't work. The other device it just \"thinks\" and looks like it is logging in, but left for a while will not log in. Both apps are up to date. No way to contact support directly, I just get sent to a \"FQA\" type page, and that suggested problem solves (check password/ make sure app is up date) are not helpful."

      "I downloaded this app to finish watching a video I started on YouTube, but that video isn't available. :/ Pretty lame.",
      "Useless! Downloads don't work unless you put your phone into aeroplane mode, so you're constantly using your mobile data and battery life. Controls don't work for bluetooth headset. It never correctly remembers where you're up to in a video. Don't waste your money until they can fix the basics. EDIT: no that article doesn't solve any of the issues I mentioned. Did you even read what I wrote??",
      "The content is awesome! But, that is useless if the app keeps telling me to check my internet connection, but I am connected and it won't show the videos. Thank goodness it was just the free trial version, can you imagine if I had purchased?",
      "No video is playable. Timeout error in both mobile and hi speed WiFi. Tried with VPN as well, same issue.",

Simple, easy to move things around, and without any instruction makes this app better than the 12 I've tried before.

I also pasted a title from another block that I deleted, and I can't figure out how to enlarge the text. I'm sure there's a way, but this speaks to the usability.",

      "Overall eVoice is a good service, but the application is beyond pathetic. The app doesn't give any notifications of phone messages or text messages even though I have it configured to do so. The only work around is to try and remember to go in the app multiple times daily to check for messages. Their tech support could care less about helping. They kept just wanting to close the ticket rather than helping and answering my questions",
      "I have never been seriously disappointed in app more than I have with eVoice. I have a business that I started up and not only do I not receive any calls but I also don't receive any notifications that I have missed a call which is extremely frustrating. I mean why do I even pay for service.",
      "Evoice is horrible. I cancelled and they still charged me. I called and got a machine and left a message with no return call. I sent an email and no response. Total BS!",
      "takes way to long to update call log call send buttons do NOT work reliably Updated a year later: same! Worse actually, now ads pop in because of the mobile app and their website ad plays loudly each time you open it! Sometimes even at random with the site being open on a different tab. So annoying and UNPROFESSIONAL.",
      "A reliable service and cost effective. Routes to other extensions, leaves message and I love the business texting feature. More professional than using your personal phone. It's worth it. Sure there could be improvements forthcoming but overall I give it a 5."

      "Great alternative to handing out your Business Card, especially to tech-savvy kids who've grown up with cell phones in their hands. The app ~does~ work, but you should practice sending via the various options, because it's not a super-intuitive interface. I mainly use Message (text), Email, and Bluetooth. There are options galore, but most of the other cross-platform transfers get complicated once you're \"inside\" the other app. I've had success with Twitter and Facebook, but not the rest.",
      "Only sends photo of card, no other information. The data that you enter under your business card photos does not get sent electronically as text. I'm not sure why I would send someone just a picture when I could hand them my card with a qr code on it. Thanks.",
      "Doesn't work. Everytime I tried to make an account it sends a error message, then leads to nowhere.",
      "I like the idea of being able to share my business card by digital means. I was a little disappointed that it's just stationary. I saw where someone had the ability to have buttons to move card front to back",
      "There is no use of this application as it automatically redirects to the website after logging. So better use it directly from the browser."

Most recently (TODAY), I created a business model to find it completely gone after saving including previous models and SWOTs that were there before today. I am not happy at all!!!!!! I would have rated this zero stars, but the SUBMIT button won't enable without selecting at least 1 star. My rating is ZERO.",
      "A good app. But i am not happy about the fact that only Google and facebook were featured in this free version. Its restricted sample case did not give enough room for evaluation to decide to upgrade to premium service. This will certainly be an excellent if more companies especially in the area of brick mortar biz. But i guess this is because this is a free version hence it is limited.",

      "I've had the app for a few months now and it's all of a sudden stopped working. Tried updating, uninstalling, reinstalling, and restarting my phone in between all. The website is working but very slow.",
      "Didn't think this app could get slower but they managed it with their latest update. Slow, clunky, limited.",
      "Broken since last update. As Sara Bee reports, the app won't open. Just a blank page with a few lines of text asking if you're sure you want to cancel the latest promotion. This is causing me daily stress and negatively impacting my business. If I can't quickly enter an appointment someone else could book it and I will be losing angry clients. A Schedulicity \"Rock Star\" told me the investigation is being \"escalated\". It's been over a week so far. Update: It is now two weeks since the fatal update broke the business app. It had worked perfectly on my phone prior to that. I am now researching other scheduling services as I am not sure the developers will be able to fix this. Schedulicity kindly offered us a one month credit but I stand to lose a lot more money due to potential scheduling snafus. Sad.. Update: It's now been five weeks since the app was broken. Looking back through Play reviews I can see complaints about the business app opening on a blank page going back to February 2017. The response is always \"Gosh! Everything looks fine on our end!\" Unfortunately for my clients and myself I feel too entrenched with Schedulicity to quit at this point. I'm feeling resigned to never being able to enter appointments or use the app when I'm outside. I have an excellent phone on Android Oreo. It's absolutely maddening to go through such frustration and have to pay a monthly fee for it.",
      "I love using schedulicity on my computer. It makes running my business so much simpler! However the mobile app only gives me trouble. I thought maybe it was my old phone...but I just got a new one and I am still having the same problem of not being able to scroll down in it. the screen gets locked on the calendar display and I can't move it down to see what's scheduled later on in the day. Sometimes if I track forward a day and then track back it will move down...but its frustrating.",
      "Screen is blank all the time....lately it has been blank and nothing opens, I have to uninstall it and install it again for it to work, but after a couple of hours, when I try to open it again, it is completely blank. * Good response from Schedulicity team (Blake), issues to be addressed."

Beware, it's infectious!",
