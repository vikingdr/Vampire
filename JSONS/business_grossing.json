      "I'm a subscriber for ~2 years. My experience was positive to start and has continued to get worse. Unfortunately, I don't recommend. Phone calls have delayed audio despite strong connection. I've communicated issues and they've persisted. Will update if that changes with this review.",
      "Good App..yet frustrating..helps out alot...but wheres the feature to delete more than 1 message...it either deletes 1 text message or them all...and also the quality of sending and receiving video and photo content are horrible...also why is there a whole other number showing up on my phone when someone calls me...i never know who is calling me",
      "Frustrating. Everything was great until today. I keep getting messages that say to keep your device mobile private open sideline app and call again. IM IN SIDELINE APP. I've reinstalled 3 times now",
      "I Have had Sideline for almost a year with no issues. I use this number for business, so it is critical. Because of a technical problem, my calls were suddenly going directly to my other numbers voicemail without ringing. I then had need to call customer service to get help. Let me tell you, it was an extraordinary experience. I was very impressed. Such real, personable, professional service ! In the end, Dominic had the whole thing corrected in less than an hour. Stellar performance !"

      "Love this app! Been using it to send my 9y.o. son's work to his teacher via email during COVID-19 lockdown. Works perfectly. If it doesn't capture the entire image, it allows you to adjust. You can batch or single scan. Has ads, but easily closed out after a second.",
      "As mentioned, this app truly feels like it's trying to scam me out of $50. Less than 72 hours after the start of the 3 day trial, I was charged. No warning. No email. Nothing. Absolutely not okay. 3 day trial? Ordered on the 16th, charged on the 19th. Less than 72 hours, THAT'S NOT 3 FREE DAYS. I've used the free version and watched ads for a while, but I'll definitely be uninstalling this app now. Disingenuous and exploitative.",
      "People who want to cancel the subscription -- you cancel it in the playstore, not in the app itself! Click on the app and it should say under Uninstall and Open buttons \"Manage subscription.\" You can follow the instructions/prompts to cancel from there",
      "Easy to be honest! In managing or removing your subscription, press \"manage subscription\" then unsubsribe here within the playstore at the open option above. Tho, needs improvement in some already understandable letters, it sometimes converts numbers to letters. Yet, overall satisfied!",
      "Good app with a scam to get you on yearly subscription for a high price. Just wanted to check it and found myself now struggling to get a refund from the developer. Feels like being cheated. Will not give a good review for such a behaviour."

      "I love using this app, the invoices are simple yet perfect for the customer, everything in detail, however the payment process is a mess, we should not be charged to receive payments if the payment takes 2-3 days to enter your account, it should be a free option because of the length it takes, it should have an instant option, like venmo, zelle, cashapp and what not, this needs to be fixed asap!!! Definitely needs to be looked into!",
      "Pros: *Extremely simple to use and customizable. *PDF invoices look professional af. *Can send invoices from within the app. *Easily handles multiple clients. *You can save line items for re-use. *Use quantity as a multiplier and have it do the math (ex. Hourly rates * number of hours). *cloud backups. I've moved devices multiple times and never lost an invoice. *Premium features are only $2.99/month, that's next to nothing for a small business. Cons: If I find any I'll update this review.",
      "Update: March 10, 2020 - after 2 weeks of reporting the problem with rounding numbers, the developer sis not take any real actions to solve the problem, rather they asked me to solve the problem manually by manipulating invoice data and the taxes so the totals mach after rounding, which I did since I did not have another alternative. After almost a year, I find myself forced to find another system that much more mature with a team behind it for testing and QA before it gets release to end users. Update - March 01, 2020 - after 2 consecutive releases with bugs and not being responsive to resolve, I found myself forced to take one star off. I hope I will come back to update my review, hoping for the best. --------------- Simple, intuitive, accurate, bug free (so far), allows you to ask for enhancements, tried but it is too early to judge, awaiting response. Good job guys, many thanks.",
      "Terrible! I paid for the whole year and then found out from their support people that I paid for a mobile version and would have to purchase another subscription to be able to use my computer to take advantage of the customizing a template for what I wanted. I can't find anything about having to pay additional fees. Also support is terrible",

      "This app has been great!!! It has become exactly what I needed, (2 phone#'s-1device) and it works better than par. It has only stopped once. However, I wrongly presumed, that I would be creating a new contacts list within the app for my business customer's and contacts. Instead, my personal contact list was imported to the app. This was a major drawback, and a disappointment. .....I'm sure I'll find the right app for the job tho.",
      "Works Fine. I needed a second line for work but didn't want to bother with two phones. Google Fi and Google Voice don't play nice together on Google Pixel, so I went with this. It's a little more than is want to pay for how often I use it. Plus the interface is VERY basic. But, it does the job I want and I don't want to bother with switching right now.",
      "Horrible app, stay far away. Phone accidentally deleted the app, and guess what, all my business calls and text messages got deleted too! Had many important business deals in there. Tech support (which takes forever to get ahold of) said I cannot retrieve the texts or old number, once app is deleted. Ontop of that, it never sends text messages reliably.Always appears to send, then says 15 mins later not sent.Very unprofessional and bad for business.Constant headaches and problems with this app.",
      "Works pretty well most of the time. Sometimes it completely logs me out. Often, a text message will show up on my list of text messages (previews), but when I click on that preview to read it, it's not in the conversation. Eventually it shows up, but usually it's way too late.",
      "This is the worst app ever I would never get it messages fail to send company tells you to on install and re install the app I've done it 17 times it signs itself out it says session has ended and you have to sign back in with all your information. Today was my last time I am uninstalling. No joy wt GoDaddy App very disappointed that I paid for it I would not recommend it or use it ever again.They responded, said I had a bad wifi/cell signal after the above.Sent pics i had 5 bars = great signal"

      "The app is pretty good considering price point for pro version. The big issue is you can only contact via email or online chat thru app when available, which is hardly ever. This is a huge problem when you're having technical issues such as emails not being sent to clients. It's a bigger problem when you're waiting for credit card funds collected by Joist but haven't been deposited into your bank account. I've had these issues for a while and no help from Joist. Going with another company.",
      "BEST app I have found to help build my business, I feel like it looks the most professional and makes my company look the same!! Love the different options to send a quote to my clients via email or text, and get a notification when they open the quote!! The options it gives them to pay an invoice with a credit card! AND also the options for the client to finance a project I'm going to do for them !!! Over all if you run your own business Contractor, handyman etc. this app will definitely help!",
      "The app has helped me quite a bit in my business, the only thing I am not too thrilled about is that they are adding more features based off what they find a contractor needs and should have access to as a basic forms, like a change order for example. I asked about that a long time ago so they knew they needed one. I hope they don't keep increasing the price and becoming too expensive.",
      "I'd like to have the licences number displayed, but to bunch it in with other useless features disappointing. Don't care about social media links. Insurance papers can be presented to customers as requested. If I'm at the point to send an Estimate, they usually know we are insured. I was with you guys from the beginning, but I'm going to have to cancel and try a new app. Don't like the direction you are going. Sorry",
      "I've been using this app for years now and it's been great. They have now taken away from it so much. Now I have non stop problems with this app. If you need myjoist help cause you can use this app good luck on having anyone to return your email. I have sent 4 emails asking for help to resolution on the problems I'm having. It's now been 5 days with no reply and they dont have a number to call for help at all. I'm not looking for a new app. I used to tell everyone about how great this app was."

      "I see that they don't really come on here and check or troubleshoot, so I'll keep it brief. I got this application, and paid for the subscription, because I do a lot of documentation on my tablet for work and grad school. I cannot count the amount of documents that have been corrupted and deleted in the middle of editing w/ NO recovery. When opening the documents in Microsoft word, they're often not formatted properly and have to be redone. Very frustrated and will not renew my subscription.",
      "It says * OfficeSuite - Free, Office, PDF, Word, Sheets, Slides & etc *. It's not free at all, You must pay extra to open it. Now i using other applications; Google LLC & Microsoft Corporation way better than this app. And most it doesn't have any Pop-up Ads. i recommend using this app Google LLC & Microsoft Corporation.",
      "Unfortunately another dishonest application described as FREE, but that's a misnomer. Let's be clear, I have no problem with paying for a functioning application, but to date all this one has allowed is the installation of an advertising model. It has not been possible to create even one document for testing. A waste of time.",
      "I could not be happier😁! Microsoft Office is not compatible with my Samsung Notepad. I purchased a MS Office license without being advised it did not work on a Android platform. MS documents work seamlessly. This application is comparable to Office in all ways. I have not found any discernable differences between MS Office and OfficeSuite. I was a Beta user for MS Office back in the Dark ages when I was using a 3-button mouse.",
      "Description says that the free version will be able to open \"apple.pages\" on android.. NOT THE CASE! It requests that you pay for the pro version. I only need to read a document! You have cost a charity a lot of time and effort with this blunder. At least change your description. Falsely advertised."

      "Edit- I have contacted you, many times, spent hours on live chat. Haven't had a reply since January when you said you the developers were trying to resolve the issues Yes I do have them turned off, another feature of your app that I pay for that doesn't work and I have to do manually. Cannot send invoices via sms at all now either.",
      "I down graded my subscription but I already have to many clients saved so won't even let me do one invoice. Money for nothing can't even use. This app is now useless. I want my money back.",
      "This is one of the shittiest invoice apps I have ever used. Two and a half years ago, it was great. Since these bozos updated it, it runs slow, and I mean real slow, and you have to hit about 40 buttons to do what used to take one or two actions. Now that the app has recently updated, it has got even worse. It really does suck more and more with every single update. Even with a Wi-Fi connection, as you begin to search for the client's name and the program is thinking, it starts erasing letters.",
      "It works but , I paid for a basic service as don't need more but to many push msg to buy full version Can't clear history so when I inputting same expense ,have to change manually every time cos price has changed If I make mistake at first line, I can't change it once it's been saved, so have to delete everything and write again ? You should do better",
      "Cannot log in at all, can't contact support directly. I need to get into the app to check an invoice and send a new one. One device I have been logged out of and password won't work. The other device it just \"thinks\" and looks like it is logging in, but left for a while will not log in. Both apps are up to date. No way to contact support directly, I just get sent to a \"FQA\" type page, and that suggested problem solves (check password/ make sure app is up date) are not helpful."

      "Hi Team, I am writing this with a very big heart. One of my friend installed this app in my phone and entered credit card details without my approval. Today I got charged with Rs 2550 and it was very shocking for me when I saw this message. I was confused where my money gone and then mistakenly checked my play store subscriptions and found due this app my money got deducted. I sincerely request the team to refund my money. Requesting you again to refund my money. Please....",
      "Hi I have Downloaded this App to check its features and they have asked to Use free trial by adding debit card details. So Once i filled up the details , free trail begins but There was no Option to cancel the subscription and now they have charged ₹2550 for me and showing to cancel the subscription. This is totally FRAUD. Kindly return back my money am requesting you.",

      "It's a nice app that's worth the purchase of the pro version. I haven't even got to use all the full functions yet because it covers all of my basic needs. I've needed an scanning app to store important documents that I shred, and now I'm also starting to use it for storing receipts as well. It's a versatile way of keeping your documents organized with good export features.",
      "Free version is more then enough to use this app to scan in homework assignments documents etc. Simply take a photo and then adjust the image to pull only the portions of the image to create a PDF. From there adjust brightness to final PDF. Choose method of transfer ie email. Pro version allows multiple projects and additional method of transfer I choose to support the app not for the features but because the quality is worth supporting.",
      "Useful tool, I've been using this app for a while and it was super handy to generate pdf files (mainly made out of marked up pictures) on the go to be emailed to relevant people which saved me a lot of time and I was able to attach much more pictures than doing it other way by attaching it individually to the email and being only half way in seeing a message that it's already over 25mb limit... Anyway - this was a brief description for one of many good uses for this app. Thumbs up Dev team!",
      "Does exactly what I need! Many college classes want me to send in a photo of hardcopy my work as a pdf. This app takes the picture of your paper and perfectly converts it into an easy to read pdf that your professors will be grateful for! The free version did everything I needed but I decided to buy the pro as it could directly upload to Google Drive among others. A great app I highly recommend!",
      "This app is great except for a critical flaw: it can't do landscape docs. I scanned 19 pages, flipping each one, just to find they all got cropped and centered in larger portrait pages. What's so hard about scanning a landscape document? Those are not a rare thing."

It is frustrating that it keeps freezing up on me. It is disappointing that the developer didn't tested out before launching it and fixing the bugs and having us use our data to find a location.",
      "The new app rollout was confusing. They should have automatically merged existing accounts and not having to create new logins or at least walked us through the process. Also the way it was presented it seemed like even as a previous paid user I would have to start a subscription to use the app. (which I found isn't required) Anyway after the dust has settled and the kinks are being worked out and I'm getting used to it, I actually think it's great! Thank you!",
      "Paid for the ultimate app and update subscription that I wasn't credited back to me and they said they discontinued it. This app needs internet to use now, if the well name is too long it won't let you see the full name when on the map, there's a bug when downloading the swd layers, the map doesn't save your wells unless you favorite them. I emailed them and they gave me a code which worked but didn't give me the discount price which I now have to pay monthly.",
      "I was extremely upset that the new app wanted me to subscribe when I had already paid for the earlier version. I sent a pretty heated email to the development team who responded right away and kindly explained to me that as a legacy user I could access all the data I previously had and how to do so. I figure the least I could do was delete my bad review and replace it with this one. Thanks guys! Your app makes life so much easier out here!",
      "Terrible. The app worked great before this update. I bought the app three years ago and was very satisfied with it. I subscribed again to this new updated version and after multiple attempts, I finally got the maps to download. However, there are no wells appearing on my map. Maybe it's the always hidden version."

      "I scanned a few documents to try it out. Then it gives you the option to send them through email but when you click send it goes to the motions that the email was sent. It's like they want you to pay the $5 or it takes your documents hostage and won't let you do anything with them. Screw this app, just a waste of time. Why would you pay for an app that you don't know the quality of the scanned documents or if it works at all.",
      "I just have a try and now I've fallen love with it. It is absolutely EXCELLENT! There's a great feature that you can easily modify the gray scale just after taking the photo. I haven't seen other apps can do this such easily. Also, you can use all the core features without purchasing a pro, ads-free! Although you can't save the results to some three-party apps with a free version, but you can simply save it to your phone! Great app! But I will still buy the pro, just wanna support it.",
      "There are lots of options, so there's bound to be one that fits what you need. The UI is simple and ready-to-use, with a very low learning curve. It is a little frustrating to see a few options blocked behind a paywall, but they're really just quality of life functions, and the developers have to earn money somehow. It's just a really good application.",
      "What a huge joke this app, I mean AD is! I downloaded it today, tried it out on a couple papers I need. That was only a few hours ago. I just tried to use it but all I get is a box asking if I want to buy it from within the app, Or if I want to download the pro version. This explains the complaints of paying and then told they don't have pro version. Just a money scam don't pay for pro!",
      "Pro app doesn''t work as advertised. In order to do multiple pages, I had to upgrade to the pro version. When I did, however, both the quality of the scan with the multi-page selection was lower in the ability to actually add a second page didn't seem to be available in the app. So far, I have heard nothing from technical support, so 1 star. I'd rate it more lowly, given that they have essentially taken my money for no good reason, but that's not an option."

      "I have been stressing sending a fax for something important that I needed done asap. I went to Staples to send an 11 page doc. Because I was sending it to another state, they considered it long distance and wanted to charge me $2.50 a PAGE. A friend told me about this app, I downloaded it, and sent it for $5. Super happy! So glad this technology exists!",
      "I'm happy! It went through the first time. No problems. I do wish though when apps claim that they are \"free\", that they don't mean the app itself? But that actually using it is free also. I really don't like opening a free app and finding out it costs 10¢ a page -which isn't much) but there is a minimum fee off $5 or $10. In the brick and mortar world this is called 'bait and switch\" and it is a fraudulent business practice. When will the internet catch up?",
      "Nice app, let me do everything I needed step by step, and I've never sent a fax before. I missed the part where you need to buy credits to send faxes, but I have a bunch of Google Play credits saved up from the Google Opinions Rewards app (seriously, if you're not using that app, you're missing out) and what the hell, I'll pay for convenience here.",
      "Great for faxing, it does what it says. Price isn't too bad. Overall really good app.",
      "It is unfortunate that I have something to comment on. I installed tiny scanner and use it all the time so I figured tiny fax would be just as great. Nope. I paid for credits, tried to fax my docs several times and they never went through. I emailed the company to see what was going on. They did respond and said they'd fix it ASAP and then asked me if I have android 10. I do and emailed back with that information and never from them again. Now they have my money and I have no service."

      "This is an excellent app, particularly if you use it with Mobisystem apps. I would give it 5 stars except for a consistent stability glltch - the app consistently vanishes (closes) unexpectedly while I am working with it. I notified the Mobisystems Support on several occasions, but after a generic \"we'll-look-into-it\" reply, hear nothing further. I can temporarily resolve the issue by uninstalling-reinstalling, but soon the problem resurfaces. I may need to find another alternative.",
      "Every time I start up file commander, it has this odd sound being played in my speaker. It sounds as if someone lit a bomb and threw it down a pipe, and then recorded it into an mp3 file for File Commander's backround music. It takes a minute to start playing the sound, but its way faster when playing a music file. The sound doesn't stop until File Commander is closed completely. I would much appreciate it being fixed as it worrys me that my speaker is busted every time I open the app.👌",
      "Update 2020. File Commander is a great failsafe app. Have used mobiles for a decade and it has NEVER failed to keep what I add safe and working through differing versions on Samsung Smart mobiles, up to latest Android 10. (Needs internet). Sends notifications when new updates available. I only rate 5 if apps work so well you can sort out issues easily or I have never had to sort out anything with support. I have never needed support with this app. That says a lot about its performance.",
      "I like the app, but I am very confused as to what I paid for. The app offers a premium version, but no listed price!! I also don't think trying it for a week would make me want to pay for it as a subscription. (I am assuming it's a subscription) AND NO PRICE GIVEN WITH THE RESPONSE. If support does not know, maybe you should find out before responding. I bought the app in good faith. This is bait and switch.",
      "Very bad experience i installed and purchased to recover some photos but it didn't work. So i delete the subscription in the same day but i have been charged and the money is gone, it says that the subcription will end after a year. This is not fair and a way making bussines. So people dont buy this app."

      "This app definitely gets the job done. May not be all flashy but it does exactly what I need it to do. I have yet to run into any issues. The most frustrating thing about it is probably having trouble capturing the image. Most of the time it's no problem, but every now and then it will take forever to get a quality scan. Overall, 4 stars. Worth it.",
      "This is a MUST HAVE app for both personal and for business that everyone should have. I LOVE IT. As a Realtor I no longer need to run back to the office to scan docs in order to send them to my clients. I am able to scan immediately where ever we are signing and clients really like and appreciate this type of service. This app has lots of great features. Thank you so much to the person or people that created this app that has made such a difference for my business.",
      "Whew! I \"think\" my search is over. Lot's of free useful setup features and lots of one time, under 5 buck, purchases. So far, it's underrated! Try it, then buy the extra features. You can live without them, but why, when the total package is so affordable.",
      "Amazing, useful, it is a game changer! I used this app for YEARS and I absolutely love it. Especially when you don't have an actual scanner. This app really makes your work look like a PDF document. BEST APP EVER! I recommended this app so MANY people, including family and they love it too! Honestly, it's even easier to use than an actual scanner and fax machine!",
      "Excellent App. Turns paperwork into a pdf, gave me a choice of emails, drives, dropbox, and more. Makes going to Staples for scanning pdf's a chore of the past. Just takes a moment to pick up and auto center documents. I love it! Way to go! The perfect modern use of technology."

      "Great app ruined by pricing policy. Firstly, as a small business this app is great. Its easy to set up a company template and generate an invoice on the go from a mobile phone. The only downside is the pricing policy is based on the value on the invoices rather than the number. So as a business that writes a few invoices a month but these exceed the $1000 monthly limit the cost per invoice is very high. For the No. I create it's not cost effective. Under $5/mo or $2/invoice & I'd subscribe.",
      "I absolutely love this app. I have been using it for a year now and I must say it is wonderful! A must have! Everything about my business is professional down to the invoice and my clients take my business very seriously because of the invoices I make using this app. Keep up the awesome work!!",
      "Wow it's amazing - well done guys! Simple to setup & upload your logo,fill in your business details and you've got a professional invoice. You can now send an invoice in seconds after completing the job. Keeps records of paid/unpaid invoices. Plenty of design layouts to choose from. With or without VAT. Set your own terms etc. Only one suggestion you are missing an invoice with:- REFERENCE DESCRIPTION PRICE. As a commercial printer it was a popular layout where quantity wasn't a factor.ll",
      "Seemed to be easy to use and quick to make invoices, but you can't change the Terms and conditions at the bottom. Maybe have it let us edit what it says there to something other than \"Terms and conditions\" to what I need, just a note without text above it. Will check back on app later.",
      "Dear Developer. i love your convenient but one thing i need d most is i need to put Custom Title for Each of my Quotes&Invoices. and i also wish to leave the date blank for each of d quotes and Invoices. is this app able to do so? most of d apps dont hv that option. it would b great if your apps can do so. tq"

On top of that, customer service is absolutely horrible. After going back and forth with many emails with a computer (not even a real person) nothing gets fixed. Unsubscribed. Uninstalled. There are higher rates apps..",

You will get tons of spam upselling you on other products, webinars and when you request to stop being spammed, they reply, you've been opted out and let us know if you get any more emails. I guess when you 'opt out' they don't guarantee that your not going to get more emails. I called to talk about it and my account had been closed. Apparently there was a billing issue 2 or 3 weeks ago that no one let me know about. I called and cleared it up and as soon as I gave them my credit card, girl says Have a nice day and hung up. Terrible people in the back office.",

      "Super app for VPN for my home desktop! Makes my time so much more effecient. Update: After using this remote desktop app I have to say that it just isn't stable and reliable at least 40-50% of the time. Getting kicked out and unable to reconnect is a real problem. Devices used: Dell Chromebook to HP 8460P Elitebook over a Gigabit router.",
      "Performance is incredible even on terribly slow internet connections. Local network connections really useful, anywhere access pack is only like 10$ a year which is freaking awesome and is extremely convenient + useful. App also has a really nice easy to minimize UI, tons of keyboard shortcuts, and 3 different mouse control schemes. Splashtop is without a question the best service on the market for PC remote control and I'll gladly pay the CHEAP subscription for such a phenomenal service! :)",
      "So far, so GOOD. I was in search of a Remote Desktop App to work woth my Android tablet, Laptop and desktop at home in different rooms. I installed the streamer on the Windows machines and it just worked! I am impressed with options available and support for direct gesture even on the phone. This makes it very easy to check on running apps. I am so impressed that I upgraded to the internet version and I am happy. Highly recommend over the other apps in this category.",
      "Lost my media remote control and I was looking for a replacement and thought to myself my phone will do anything for my TV there's got to be something for my PC and there you where SplashTop my favorite application and it's so much better than a traditional remote that uses Infrared that's line-of-sight used in limited functionality do to key space",
      "Update: TOO MUCH SOUND DELAY. I have a fast internet connection and still have too much sound delay. I contacted the developer through email THREE times and there was no response or improvements. I use triple monitor and its hard to change over one monitor to the other to control each display, it would be better if you make it easier to go through each monitor, or even better - an option to display all three monitor at the same time from my phone."

A long press on that line will show a transmission verification report when \"Fax Receipt\" is chosen.",
      "I tried for 13 hours to send one fax of five pages. I paid $3.18 to cover the extra 4 pages, plus the free page. It would not send my fax. I tried multiple options to get the fax to work and nothing did. Instead I use Fax.Plus. Fax.Plus sent my fax the first time within 5 minutes. After I wasted all evening and night fighting with this app. This app does not work and you cannot get your money back!",
      "So far so good. Free credits worked. Not sure why others said they didn't. Registration was just email and password and the app took me straight to it once I tried to send my fax. I registered and it sent me right back and I selected get 15 free credits and other options came up that I could buy, but I just hit the back button in the app. It took about a minute to send one page but I have slow internet in a rural area. Long click on sent fax to see verification of received status.",
      "Update: ended up having to uninstall the app, and install app again. Afterwards, my 15 page fax sent immediately. Apparently it had absolutely nothing to do with the number of pages sent. But thanks for the advice. Smh. My advice to YOU is that if 15 pages is too many, maybe you should advise the app users of that BEFORE they try to send the fax and not AFTER. I paid for 15 pages, that i have been trying to fax since 6 am. Not happy at all....",
      "Not only do you get enough credits to send 1 free page, but you can spend as little as 1 dollar for more credits as opposed to another app where the minimum was 10 bucks worth of credits. For someone like me that only needs to send 1 page every once in a great while, that's like saying it costs 10 bucks per page."

      "I've been using this app for years. In my opinion this is the best app for scanning documents and exporting them in various files formats. I have used this on both IOS and Android and my opinion stays the same. For me, scanning documents every day and exporting them as .PDF files is a laborious process. Using turboscan has mitigated that and made this allot more easier. The UI is very easy to navigate. I have not run into any bugs for the past 7 or 8 years of me using this.",
      "This app is great. I love that I can utilize it for my work. I tell others how easy it is to use & I get clients to download it to send me their documents. It's easy to scan, crop & send the scanned documents in various formats to anyone in my contact list .. directly from this app. It updates automatically ... I absolutely love this app!!",
      "I've been using this app for 9 months now, and I use it for checks, documents, scanning letters and notes from work, sheet music. It does a great job of creating high quality facsimiles. It's not going to give you a 100% HD replica of a printed document, but it is WONDERFUL for record keeping and document sharing. I highly recommend it.",
      "It works great. Really like the way it processes the pictures. Two issues that make me look for alternatives, even after purchased that one: 1. Need to import multiply pictures to app from my gallery. Currently need to do that one by one. 2. After initially imported page to multipage document I cannot modify page any more, so crop and other options are available just once. I really need to process pages after have completed importing them.",

It can also send as a fax images in PNG and JPG formats.  Enabling you to fax images saved by your phone's or tablet's camera.\r\n\r\nYou will need to purchase fax credits through the Google play store (in-app purchase) to send a fax.  Fax credits are not refundable in whole or in part once you have started a fax.\r\n\r\nFaxes transfer in the background from your phone or tablet to our fax servers which do the actual sending.  Fax status is returned to the application at each step.\r\n\r\nThere no monthly subscription required in order to send faxes.  NOTE: for international faxes, check the international rate table in the application before purchasing credits to verify that the country(ies) you care about are supported.\r\n\r\nSupports sending a fax to contacts or typed in fax numbers for a one-off fax.\r\n\r\nWe will automatically retry faxes that don't go through initially - no additional charge and you don't need to do anything.

Don't rely on \"of course the fax machine is working\".\r\n\r\nFax formats of image files (photos of documents) takes quite a while to transfer and send as a fax.\r\nAllow at least 3 minutes per page to transfer and two minutes to fax if you are sending a scan or image (photo) file.  More if your data connection maybe ... slow.\r\n \r\nSee the introductory help in the FaxFile app and FAQ for more information.\r\n\r\nWorks with all Android devices including tablets.

Ever since the latest update everything loads so much slower and your have to wait and wait for a list to show up or other things. Everything used to be so instant, minus the manual refresh, but not sure what's going on. If this is a trade off for the automatic refresh, I'd go back to the other version just to get faster load times the way it used to be.",
      "App was great till recent update now I can no longer see my outstanding invoices, quoted work, paid and unpaid invoices on my tablet. Yes, I have submitted a request to fix and still in a holding patern for over three week now. I have used this app for five years now and will be taking my business elsewhere. Update: that problem is now fixed 2 weeks later now I can not send estimates via email to my clients.",
      "App as been great for the last 5 years untill recent update now i cant send estimate and invoice tried contacting you numerous times to be told someone will deal with it, still no joy and as a small business with Christmas round the corner this just isnt good enough and doesn't look like i will be getting payed for Christmas. You have got until tomorrow otherwise i need a reliable alternative.",
      "Use it with android and it takes forever to refresh , not like iOS. Please fix this issue . Also, the invoice late date should be from the date it was signed not the date it was created. Otherwise , great app"

      "It's a great idea and could be really useful if it accurately captured the data on the business card. But every single cards needs to be edited for accuracy before you save it. I even bought the premium membership to be able to save it to contacts, and I swear that made it worse. And you have to pay extra for proofreading? That's just plain obnoxious. It seems like it might be faster to enter it all manually in to my contacts. Anyway, if they can fix the inaccuracy in the data, it would be useful to have. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on an upgrade to premium.",
      "Garbage app if you ever update. It will delete ALL cards. Not worth the hassle and frustration of losing ALL business contacts. Unreliable. Would give NO stars if I could. 😡 Remember...this app is out of China. They probably have all my business contacts... deleting.. 🤬",
      "It's not perfect but it's doing what I need - IT WAS. I haven't used it in at least 6 months. I don't recall having to give my GOOGLE EMAIL AND PASSWORD TO THESE PEOPLE AND BESIDES, OTHER APS HAVE ACCESS TO MY CONTACTS WITHOUT NEEDING MY GOOGLE ACCOUNT PASSWORD. I'M GOING TO FIND ANOTHER CARD READER. I don't trust these people.",
      "I am very happy with the app and the results of the OCR process are quite satisfying. Sometimes not 100% recognition possible! Ameliorations are possible in the field of handwritten cards or with the different fonts. Very good app: MUST-TRY!",
      "Used to be a great app as it would sync with google contacts. Now they want $46 a year to sync with contacts, so it's pretty much useless. Terrible decision on their part. Don't waste your time with this one anymore."

      "Do not recommend! The app errors out all the time. If you send an error report you get back a completely illegible message from someone somewhere that tells you to disable your battery saver settings. I have Nine exempt from every single one of the battery saver settings on my phone and it still gives me the internal error multiple times a day. The only way to refresh my email at that point is to completely restart my phone. Sometimes that works. Uninstalling. Do not recommend.",
      "My Main Email App! I've been using Nine since I ran into issues with the built in email client and the Outlook app back in 2015/2016. I haven't had no issues with this app besides the occasional password updates that got to be entered manually, but thats it not major problem. Other than that I use it all the time on both of my phones. Thumbs up for this one.",
      "Best Exchange client. Fast, huge number 9f options and configuration options. Exchange GAB (global address book) support is great in and of itself but but it's even more useful since other apps on your phone can now pull info from the GAB (if configured to do so). Exchange mobile device management from the Exchange host can be sandboxed to only include the email client. Remote wiping and similar requests from the server admin would only impact the client rather than the entire device.",
      "KEEP YOUR $15. After \"sending them logs\" three times, I have yet to receive any assistance from their overseas help, only more emailed requests for logs. Obvious that multiple individuals there are not communicating with each other. Accounts unsync for no reason losing all settings, email will not automatically sync without being forced, interface is absurd to navigate. TERRIBLE IN EVERY WAY.",
      "Error reporting isn't working. Some of my emails are showing in inbox after being archived. On every refresh of email. Plz solve this issue. Update: Report a problem generates a file but it doesn't do anything. It can't be saved or shared to any app. No matter what I select, nothing happens."

      "Annoying. I was enjoying this app until a bug caused 3 PAID credits to disappear. I was drafting a 3 pg fax & decided not to send it-- so I cleared out all of the fields & backed out of the app which caused the app to crash. When I relaunched, the draft was gone as were my 3 credits. 😤 The fax was NEVER sent. Note to users, be very careful with this buggy & unstable app. If it crashes while you're drafting a fax or you decide to delete a draft, YOU WILL LOSE THOSE CREDITS regardless. SCAMMY.",

So now I cannot use the full features. I use it for business purposes. On the website it now indicates that you need to buy the app for $29.99. At this point I am very disappointed and will use the Blue Mail app instead. Not to happy with this. BTW...I sent an email and 24hrs later still no response. RESOLVED bu Mobisystemsa",
      "I really like the look and feel of this client, but I can't get it to open my individual emails. Maybe that's because of my account being with Startmail. I'd like some help from the creator(s), if you can. What I'm trying to accomplish is saving the entire contents of a folder, which has emails from a few years ago until now. The guy might die soon, so it's imperitave that I save it all. If I can make this happen, I will change it to 5 stars.",
      "This is the email app I've been looking for. All the other ones I've tried suck. Mainly I was looking for maximum customizability. You can't go wrong with that! No problems or even anything to nit-pick so far. It feels like a quality email app, and for that I will pay up the premium fee. Brilliant stuff, I'm very satisfied! Edit: I had a problem which I contacted support with. They never replied but I guess the issue was fixed, I don't have the problem anymore. More communication would be nice.",
      "Fantastic app, love it. It works as intended. It seems like the problem I experienced might have fixed itself. I guess there was some hiccups. If I ever experience it again, I'll try to check if I can fix it by changing some of the settings :)",
      "It's worked flawlessly, which I need. Stable. It just works. I see it's really customizable, which is a bonus. Most important thing is that it syncs email reliably. That wasn't my experience with Boxer. Happy to pay for the ad-free version. Please don't ever sacrifice stability for features!"

      "There are many options out there for a good time clock system, I've tried many and this is the best. Easy to use and extremely helpful when you contact the developers with questions. Highly recommend!",
      "I have come to relay on this app as the way to keep track of my employees’ hours. Not only is it beneficial to me, but my guys also love it. Both employers and employees can reliably and with accountability for any changes, keep track of the time worked. In addition, it is super easy to use both on your phone and on a desktop so even the tech-unsavvy people end up adopting it easily. In construction it is hard to enforce your guys to use any system so the fact that my guys not only use it, but also love it is all I can ask for. I Definitely recommend this app!",
      "I love this app! It is easy to navigate on both mobile and desktop. I can track where my employees are when they clock in and out. Creating a pdf timesheet is just a push of the button. Makes payroll time much, much faster! The service and support team is quick to respond and address your concerns. I highly recommend!",
      "Sinc gave me an easy and convenient way to accurately track employee hours who were working remotely. Even for someone who is not technology savvy, the software was easy to use and time entry errors were easy to correct. I would have liked a way for employee to digitally sign once paid. I never got the GPS tracking to work, so it would be important to verify employee is on project location. I was still satisfied with how well it help solve the issue of tracking remotely working employees.",
      "Great app! Before start using Sinc in my automotive paint business, I used at least 4-5 apps on the market and surprised to see how incomplete they are. Sinc is not like that. It's super user friendly, super fast, simple and functional. After loging in, it only takes me a second to see how many hours my employees make that week and write their checks."

      "Do not use! Stay away from downloading anything at all. I tried using the first day, it didnt work, several times, even though I kept getting an email saying fax was successful. I tried canceling, it kept freezing. They charged after 6 days, and was deceiving because on the 7th day I was unable to cancel through Google. In addition, they charge $99 on top of it all, and this is mentioned nowhere. I have requested the money back, I have yet to receive it. I contacted the credit card company.",
      "Had app for less then 29 minutes before they took 166.00 out of my bank. When tried to cancel was forced to put in email verify so when you do that it gives you second number so they charge you for a year when your on 7 day free trial. I called google play they told me the developer already had the money they took out of my bank in hand. It's not Google it's the developer. I want my full refund.",
      "Beware Beware, do not install this app is a horrible, it did not work when you cancel your 7-Day subscription it says restore and from reviews I see that they still charge and the company claim that Google is charging.. I canceled and they I sent me a message saying under review I contacted Google to make sure that they are canceled so that's your best bet that when you cancel them contact Google to make sure that they are will not be charging you $100 + fee...just make sure for yourself",
      "Need to cancel? Go into your Subscriptions (applies to all stores). Manage your subscriptions and canel your subscription through the store you got the app on. The ways to canel through the website and app are NOT working and customer aupport will give you the run around.",

      "So great, makes my end of wk a piece of cake, really love it. The only problem I've had is if I need to edit a entry, when I long press the entry to get to edit, it takes me to a screen with all entries....the entry I want to edit should be on top but it's not. You have to spend time going through entries to find the one you need to edit. Fix this problem and you'll have 5 stars from me!",

This app is PERFECT for the self employed service based business, & small bus. owner. Fast & easy to learn & navigate. Wish I had known about this app sooner. When I had a ? it was answered promptly. It may not be for everybody, but I am very happy. I'm more organized, I get invoices out MUCH quicker. Phone to computer access is WONDERFUL. Thanks guys, KUTGW!!!!!",

      "Last time I used this app I remember it being great, this time (several months later) I am greeted basically no functionality in the app unless you upgrade to the pro version or pay an in app purchase. Basically this app is no longer free from what it seems. It's also littered with ads, including ones that randomly pop up and fill the whole screen. Unfortunate.",
      "Well, I'm waiting for the pop-up adds and upsell, but so far, they haven't come. I use this kind of app for many things. I find it quite convenient and much nicer that many comparable apps. The app I used to use has become loaded with bloatware, pop-ups and it takes way too long to get anything done. This app far exceeds them. I highly recommend Simple Scan and will do so with word-of-mouth as well.",
      "So far for my work requirements from the app. It does really well and recalls old documents as well in case. Keeps each time I access separate which I need. No need to clean sheet it. It does it on its own for me. I just keep taking pictures and it stores, sends as I need. Simple, effective, cool.",
      "App is simple. Too many intrusive ads. Ads will pop out and make it difficult to look at or do anything. Instead of locking up more advanced features to paying customers, the developer appears to have decided to serve ads almost to the point that free version is unusable. It would be nice if the developer could keep the basic part of the app without ads popping out.",
      "Does exactly what it says. Plus it's still free unlike majority of all the other similar apps that started of free but now want to charge for the same service. So would rather use this app which does exactly the same as them but for free. Hopefully this won't start charging once it gets a loyal customer base."

No reply, even though Matt told me to let him know. Lost out. Thanks a lot Turbo Fax. I will be uninstalling as soon as this posts.",

      "This app has been very helpful in the past when I paid for the Pro version. But for the last year, I have to spend extra time closing out these ads for the other products/upgrades/etc that are offered. Finally get past this just to get reminded about Font packs that don't exist or whatever. Tap \"don't ask again\" for the hundredth time, and finally I can look at my documents. Time to start searching for another app.",
      "it's the only app I use to edit all documents, but it often lags when typing & has a few oddities like won't delete when using SwiftKey keyboard. The best thing is that it converts any Microsoft doc to pdf & also allows pdf editing. it's also one of few apps that converts apple's .pages docs into Word .docx for when my clients only have Apple (annoying) products",
      "Please enter 2020 by using smart quotes! I like this app but my docs are riddled with supposed misspelled. Spellcheck is useless because of this. Otherwise there would be seamless integration with documents form other apps. I'd give 5 stars because of features and NOT forcing me to use a proprietary cloud service. Instead, I'm always looking for an alternative. What's the hold up?",
      "If I wanted ads, I would have picked the \"free\" version. Keeps pestering the user with promotions of even cooler product options. Not once, not twice but nearly every second run. Sure, you want to endorse the \"premium\" version, but there should be a setting to hide these ads for optional components or ban them to some submenu. The menu is also cluttered with promotional items at the top. In terms of the advertised functionality the app does what it claims it does.",
      "Used to love it...I purchased this app because I was impressed with it. I have used Documents 2 Go forever and found that I liked this more. They did regular updates and it works. My irritation and reasoning behind a one star is that I get annoyed with a popup to purchase their Premium package that is an additional $20/yr. I get it, you need to make more money. Fine, BUT don't annoy customers who paid for the app with constant popups to pay more money! BAD BAD marketing decision."

      "The app has potential but needs a lot of work. The chat automatically refreshea and sends you to the bottom and is VERY VERY ANNOYING when you are trying to scroll up to read missed texts and ppl are typing at the same time. It honestly made me very angry at times. Another thing is that I see a lot of \"unsupported message type\" in the chats and I have no idea what that means. The all isn't bad but a lot of basic features needs a refresh ASAP.",
      "The app keeps crashing ever since the new update. I cannot see anything my coworkers type, nor can I respond to them. I've tried everything and the app is still broken. It worked great before the new update, I just wish I could use it again.",
      "App works smooth enough, I'm an employee. Some bugs on the full day schedule, minor stuff. Big problem I have is the app isnt sending notifications out for chat messages. Notification settings are correct on app info, any info on how to fix this problem?",
      "Glitchy, notifications of the same messages over and over. Shift trades disappear before they get approved. Been using this app for the past year. Now I'm not getting any notification about employee messages",
      "This app is amazing it's helped me in so many ways I absolutely love that I can keep up with my coworkers and bosses plus having your schedule at all times it is extremely handy."

These designs would take FOREVER to create not even counting the time it takes to figure them out. This app does pretty much everything these pro tools do with easy to use features that help you access a library of royalty free design elements, fonts, and templates.

      "Amazing!!! Was looking for something like this to track my hours, works amazing, like that you can adjust/add times if you need to aswell..",
      "I love this app. It's very user friendly and easy to navigate. I like that you can customize and track your pay periods. The GPS/location clock in/ out capability is a major bonus- especially for someone like me who forgets. I initially started using the free version and after 2 weeks (which I believe is how many entries you can input with that version), realized it was going to be something I'd need/ use and bought the full version. Highly reccomend!",
      "Overall great tool for managing your hours worked between several different jobs. Provides several options for adjusting overtime pay rate, and inputting no-taxable items like Meal Perdium. My only complaint would be that I seem to be unable to calculate hours worked in a week collectively amongst several different jobs, for the purposes of calculating overtime pay this app will only give you the overtime PER job.",
      "Love this App, I've been using it for over a year now, it helps me keeping track of my hours worked. There's only one thing I reckon it's missing, I would love to be able to set a Weekend rate for every job I have in my account... I still need to manually change the pay rate every time I finish work on Saturday/Sunday. Hopefully dev can do something about it at some point :)",
      "I use this app to track the hours I spend working on different projects and it has made the process so much simpler. The ability to make adjustments, pause and add breaks and comments all help me keep my timesheet accurate for my own sake and the sake of my clients."

      "Ok, so I needed to store my documents on an SD card, therefore I had to purchase the premium version. $7.99AUD, not a lot but when you expect the premium version to be better than the normal free one and it's worse, per sé, useless, I get a wee bit ticked off. The dozen or so documents I had scanned on the free version have disappeared without a trace. I'm hoping for a refund but the money has probably disappeared too. DON'T BUY IT.",
      "The app worked great for a while and then became faulty after use of more than a month. The issues: the app would switch off at random points. The screen would go black. Now it is not uploading the JPEGs I am taking to my Onedrive. It just says Simple Scanner Pro is running. I would suggest using an app that is a bit more reliable as taking photos is essential for my work as an archivist and I spend just as much time trying to get the app to work as I do researching and documenting!",
      "Nice easy app to use that does what it says it should. It has been very useful both personally and professionally. Just one thing to say about the current version, the way in which you're able to adjust the scan area after you take a photograph is better than previously as it is more accurate but the older and slightly less accurate way was a lot quicker. I think mostly that quicker is better than more accurate. Could we have the option to use either? Maybe we already do and I didn't notice.",
      "Clean and easy to use, does all what one expects it to do. Automatic detection of the document border in the picture is slighty off, by only a few pixels, but that is only a minor annoyance. Will never look back to camscanner, ever.",
      "App is easy enough to use. But I paid to upgrade to pro in order to fax. Now I have to pay more money for coins to fax. Doesn't make much sense to me...."

So if I go to sell it I can show the time it has been ran also that maintenance has been done during to proper timetable. To try and get the most I can get.",
      "Great app, keeps track of your pay amt. as well as your hours, say if u go in at 7am & get off at 4pm daily u can do all your hours for the week at the beginning if you want. If u end up getting off earlier you can definately change it later. They have a free version or a paid one, the paid one will keep popping up asking you to pay, hit the back button to continue using the free version. I love it its definatly helpful, they have the option to manually enter or hit button to log in &out.",
      "I love the app. I like the suggestion about double taps or something to prevent accidental punches. I hate the auto tracking. Would love to see an improved importing into Excel so that I can make totals easier. For example, I don't know an easy way to total the hours worked without manually going in and changing the value to a number. And maybe add web access.",
      "I absolutely love this app. It's super simple to use and extremely helpful for someone that works independently. I'm a nanny and it's really nice to just put my hours on here and have it calculate it all for me then let me send a report to the family I work for instead of sitting down and having to figure it all out and hoping there's no errors. I would highly recommend!! 10/10",
      "I work outside all day and I have to keep track of my own hours and turn them in weekly for payroll and this app works great! Keeps my weeks in order, lets me leave notes on my accout and records the time that I spend at each account if i want it to, super easy to navigate. If you guys decide to update it don't take amything away, just make it better then it already is.."

      "The app was working great until about a month ago then it started freezing up. I have to close the app several times before it will work again then it only works for a short amount of time. I have emailed the company and have not recieved a response. I wish I didn't need to use this app but it's required for my job. Very frustrated!!!",
      "App is working extremely SLOW. Takes minutes to show schedules. When. It do finally show the schedule, it allows you to view it for seconds then it goes away.",
      "I can no longer access the app after the last update. I already was unable to upload schedules correctly (I reached out about that but never heard back) and now I can't get in at all. It won't send the text with the pin to log in. I can get the call to work but it crashes the app and then I have to start all over. Very frustrating as this is the main way to communicate with my coworkers."

The options are very well thought out and the selection of pictures, objects is surprisingly great!",

This is a decent app to help get you started in designing a logo. I'm using this app to create samples before paying a designer to create an official logo for my business. Upgrading to the Pro is reasonably priced and you get a lot extras from it, so I recommend that.",
      "I use this a lot for transparent backgrounds whenever doing an emblem for t-shirt or something but i also use this for labels and posts and I wish there was a way you could add a picture from camera roll to be your background.

      "What a great app! Super simple to use - just tick the items you want to disable and they turn off. I had to turn Facebook Installer back on in order to install something, so I unticked it, installed my app, then ticked it again. Worked immediately with no restart required. Not sure whether it has improved performance, but from a privacy perspective I like to turn off all those Bixby/Google/Facebook processes and for GearVR it lets me use it as a cardboard headset.",
      "Didn't work Samsung 9. List that identifies all the bloatware not available after multiple attempts to obtain and save as instructed. Reached out to customer service who responded i.mediately with, \"we don't know which package disabler you purchased\" & that it's only good for about 6 months due to developers changing code, etc. I responded immediately with receipt for package disabler pro purchased that day. No response after that. Do not give device administrator privileges or you can't uninst",
      "The app works as expected on my Galaxy S9 with Android 10. A little disappointed that I needed to buy this app again after the developer changed the name and the old version no longer being updated and not working on anymore. Would be a five star if not for that. One last point, it doesn't seem to be able to disable packages inside of the secure folder, but that might be a limitation of Knox.",
      "It lists bloatware and there are boxes to check, but if you go to the drop down menu, there's no setting to disable the app you check and there's no info on how to do it. If you tap uninstall, it uninstalls package disabler pro instead of the app you checked the box for. I would appreciate some advice. Thanks",
      "It's a great app and does what it's supposed to without rooting. Been using it since Note 4. But I think this is my 3rd time buying it? I understand you keep getting taken off the store. But at least give us that paid in the past free access. The last version stopped working entirely, even tho I had it installed when it was taken off. Now I have 2 versions on the same phone lol. It's cheap, but still, it isn't fair to us loyal to you."

When I tried to purchase the pro version for super swipe it kept asking for me to pay and when I tried to pay again it gave me an error that said I already subscribed. That seems very suspect!!! I immediately canceled and now looking for a refund!",
      "Quote wont update. Been the same for a week now. I loved this feature but now it's not working right. Weeks after, now the quotes are updating daily but it cannot be shared anymore. I keep clicking the share button, nothing comes up. So frustrating. I loved this app for the quotes they share daily.",
      "Used to like this app... now not sure whats going on? Been almost a month and I'm not getting any daily batches or search results! Keeps telling me there is a connection problem or I'm offline even after updating! I paid for pro mode before and was considering again but not till this problem is fixed...",
      "I can understand that an app needs to gain momentum but I moved to a new city and hoped this would hook me up with folks in my industry locally. Instead, it recommends people from other cities, in pretty random jobs compared to my LinkedIn profile. Push notifications to suggest swipes from people that don't then appear in my list to reciprocate is just frustrating. The app doesn't do enough to justify its usefulness to me so why part with cash for a paid plan hoping it'll improve? Uninstalling.",
      "When this app first came out it was actually decent. You were matched with people in your local area and it worked. I met a few people in real life and made new connections. Recently however they decided to paywall specifying your area and instead your are match with people from hundreds of miles away who don't share your interests. They decided to make people pay monthly for the key function of the app which is to meet others. It off-putting as many people will just find free alternatives to meet people instead. Effectively the app is useless now, good concept originally but the path the developers chose for monetization has been a counterproductive decision in the end."

      "This app is easy to use. For the first free 10 credits, you have to log in and click on the credit icon for it to give you the option of adding the credits. This app has the option for you to send the cover letter as well. With my phone I had to click on an icon that looks like a paper with the settings symbol. This cover letter must be paid for with your credits as well. You can watch some videos to get extra free credits (not sure what is the limit) and you can check in for 1 credit daily.",
      "App is straight and simple. It gives you 15 free credits; 10 are required per page. You can buy 50 for less than three dollars. So did I. The fax worked without flaws; just had to wait a couple of minutes for answer. Rate is reasonable for a few pages. If you have to send a lot, it might be better to search other means, unless it's an absolute emergency. Worked out well for me.",
      "Fairly easy to use, once you learn to hit the camera icon to add pages instead of the next or arrow icon. Sent the fax within a few minutes. Much easier than going to a box store to send a fax. I plan to use again.",
      "Great experience. First page is free and extra credits are a decent price. I usually go to the library but sometimes I cannot get there and have been looking for an alternative. I have tried other fax apps and so far this has been the best one to use. Others are too exspensive.",
      "It would be nice to get a confirmation that the recipient actually received the fax. Top Fax shows that it went through, but there is not a confirmation from the recipient. The app itself is easy to navigate and use, and the prices seem fair. Thank you."

      "Inside invoice bee is the ability to accept credit cards. When you go to that screen and set up it will not link to the credit card processor. Numerous contacts with invoice bee support they do not understand the problem and think it could be a bug. Beware of this program it would be best find a different program that will do all your needs for taking care of your customers.",
      "Been very happy with the performance of this app as well as web version. Had one glitch that seemed to clear up. I bring that up because I emailed customer service and got a response rather quickly. What impressed me was the follow up emails to make sure things were working flawlessly. I've had other invoicing programs that was next to impossible to get a response from. But to have a follow up email gave me the confidence to know this is the app to stay with. Web version and app work seamlessly.",
      "I have tried to purchase a one year plan using my naira mastercard but to no avail. I also tried to change my logo on the setting but it not working. But overall all its been an amazing invoice app. Thank you. But do something so I can purchase the app.",
      "I used to move around with a laptop to make quotations and at times it was difficult to use a laptop because power is a challenge in my country Zimbabwe, but using a laptop became a thing of the past after discovering this Invoice app because I can now do everything on the phone and track my clients saved in my app and do a reconcilliation with ease or simply copy a quotation to be an invoice. Excellent app. Sly",

And if you take want to get creative, you can create your own from scratch! I've been brainstorming for branding and logos the past few days. I've gotten to where I can create quality logos and branding with only 5 to 30 minutes per logo, with great results! 🥳👍",
      "There is no need to buy icons, you can get very creative with what is being offered. But I promise you, you will be even more creative if you get the \"PRO\" icons. Either way it is an app that offers satisfaction to those who wish to have an understanding at the career. Do NOT let this app flop as it is one of the best for 2020 right now.",
      "You can get ALL of the logos on pro that you Have To Pay For on other logo maker apps for FREE. Its a waste of money for what they charge you for the \"pro\" version and seems kinda scamy especially for the fact you can get any of the \"pro\" logos for Free on other apps..:/ maybe w9rth 1.99 or 2.99 but not the 4.99 for sure",
      "Brilliant app!!! Top of the range!!!!! 10 out of 10!!!! In fact it was so brilliant I paid to upgrade it, my original intention was to do it for free but I'm truly truly pleased with my new logo!!! It's very hard to find apps that do pictures of different colour gemstones"

You can do it by sharing your document, etc. to PrinterShare. Also I can \"Print\" to the \"Microsoft Print to PDF\" utility - though in the computer a pop-up window requires you to give it a name and save it. Your computer will need to be on to do the PDF, but not to print to your printer if it is connected directly to your local Ethernet network. Initial access is password protected.",
      "This is a wonderful app that allows me to continue to use my printer that I've had for a while, it does the job and does it well. I just wish it had more options for printing specifically to be able to print on both sides. I print a lot of documents that are rather large and need to be front and back. It's rather tedious to number the pages by odds and evens each time. Perhaps it will in the future. I do also wish they had a free version, like print 5 free pages to try first before buying.",

      "Nice app though, first time I purchased the 1month subscription it worked perfectly but the problem I'm facing now is, my 1month subscription is expiring 22/03/2020 and on the site, it says\"\"your next charge will be on 22/03/2020\"\"and until now I couldn't find on the site how to keep the particular number safe by paying some extra charge to keep it safe for like another 1week or 2weeks at least, because I still have $4.40 to pay.Team pls giud soon coz I don't want to loose my WhatsApp contacts",
      "No value provided. My time was taken. My money was wasted. False misleading claims in the promotion of their product. Customer service is non existant. My request for refund refused. The app doesn't let you retain the number you choose. This is not a solution for Google verification despite Wabi marketing suggesting it works \"mostly\" Please define mostly Wabi? Update - Wabi refuse refund despite misleading claims. Pointed to T&C's which were not set out clearly",
      "Top app. Polite language, quick response, loads quick. This is exactly what I wanted. I've noticed here people complaining of why credit card on free trial, let me mention that even in Netflix you can't try without credit cards. It's the trend in modern business. Theres nothing free. Well at least you should own a credit card.",
      "Do not pay a single penny for any in app subscription..it is FRAUD app...the developer doesnt even respond...ive paid for the subscription and still haven't received any service nor response.. how google is still allowing this app and allowing to use its payment services???",
      "This app promise for free trial but always turns to payment mode. Until unless some one should not try how the working of this app howcome can directly buy the number. The real business people who want to use this app is suffering because of it. My suggestion is if this problem prevails than there are many other sites like 2nd number, Hashed and Textnow which are still providing free trials as they comit, no need to waste time and energy on this app.."

      "I found all fax apps to cost something to actually fax, no suprise. But this app had pretty good reviews so I tried it. I really only needed to send one fax at the time so I purchased the 3 credits for $3.99. It takes only one credit to send a 1-5 page fax. So, when the occassion arrives where I need to send another fax or two I already have the credits. The app itself is pretty easy to use. You can use your camera to take a picture of your document and crop it and lighten or darken the print.",
      "Convenient app but it faxes over blurry copies. Tried it twice, and the same result both times. If that weren't an issue, If give five stars.",
      "Very handy and portable you can just fax straight from your phone, ive been using this for many years and it saves me a lot of time, stress and money",
      "It takes a bit of time to send a fax if not using WiFi. However, the cost to fax several papers are fair...best deal for larger faxes.",
      "Just installed and I was able to send a 5 page fax and a 3 page fax. Only problem was it would not read my phone files, only from the cloud."

I am forced to pay or move my data elsewhere. STAY AWAY!!! zero warning or perks for users utilizing their services. terrible business move. Farm at Hand is much better!!!",
      "I used to enjoy this free app for simple tracking of rain fall. Now, without warning, they have changed subscription levels for the people that have helped them build and design this app, and are charging at least $120 per year for access to data which was free a month ago. User beware, their greediness has taken over, and it's sure to only get worse. I will be finding another platform to track data on my own property",

      "I use this app to track rainfall on the food plots we plant on our hunting property. Rainfall accuracy was only so-so compared to our rain gauge but at least the app showed you rainfall history. Now they're charging $29 per month for that - NFW!

      "Easy to use, app and desk. I do use the app, but the barcode scanner doesn't work. Using note 10, everything up to date, including app. Helpdesk asked if it was all up to date, replied with yes and specs. Never received another reply, even reached back out and nothing back. I like all that it offers, I will continue using. My rating is based on lack of help of their software, and the main reason for users of this app is the scanner and it's not working.",
      "Works well but expensive. I needed something with a barcode scanner to catalogue my sewing patterns, sheet music and books at home so I don't re-buy things. It was really easy to use and Ifigured I'd upgrade when I hit the hundred item limit only to discover that the plans are super expensive. This is not an effective choice for home users, only businesses. I recomend the developers look at making a single user subscription for others like myself who just want to keep track of things at home.",
      "Really happy with app but disappointed with pricing. The interface is great but $40 a month as your next price point from the free trial version is going to exclude a lot of customers who'd pay maybe $5 a month just to have more entries available. Was excited to use this but going to have to switch to a different app given the pricing.",
      "Using to inventory waste treatment plant machines. I am able to take multiple photos, enter a serial number using the free custom field and then export all the data so that my pictures are neatly organized in an Excel sheet. This saved me a ton of time as pairing photos of machines that all look simular to their actual names, locations and serial numbers would have been a nightmare.",
      "Good for keeping track of basic small inventory. Anything very large (over 100 items) or advanced features will require a subscription."

Now my client isn't receiving my invoices in their mail since the update, even in their junk mail, even though my email shows it sent.

      "Great in parts, but frustrating. Essentially the variety of template styles and editing options are great. However, you cannot (or at least I haven't been able to) magnify the template. So when editing on a phone (I don't have access to a tablet) it is very difficult to get all the graphics the correct size. My fingers get in the way and so do the icons. I'd like to be able to pick a section of the Template in order to align and shrink icons to fit. It's a shame as the options are fab.",
      "Tooooo many ads... & it made my phone moved so slow after I'd downloaded it. Also, what I hate about the app is that if I leave the app (even for a second) my work disappears before I could finish it. & the sizing of the texts doesn't even work. I tried to make my text bigger & it's still the same small size. It doesn't move from that size (size doesn't increase). Terrible app",
      "Simple Interface, great quality, just what I was looking for.",
      "I like the app a lot - I just wish it were possible to schedule a post to one's own Pinterest, Tumblr, Reddit - it gives the option to create post's for these accounts but no option to schedule. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter only.",

I uninstalled and reinstalled hoping that would work, it didnt and it erased all of my invoices. You would think since I have lifetime membership, this would not happen. I'm also unable to log in on the sign in page. I clicked on email link to send email but received email advising email not valid.",
      "I got this app two days ago, liked it so I purchased the lifetime membership. Now it's not allowing me to create invoice. It keeps closing out. Very ANNOYING!!!!",
      "Works ok . Doesn't send invoices all the time . When it works it's great. Their support email doesn't work. Iam a paid subscriber. Lost all my invoices and have to back track months worth of invoices. Wont log back in and I've spent 100bucks",
      "What a waste of time. Downloaded it and set it up. When attempting to send or share invoices it just continues to spin. Others reported this as well, yet developer claimed it was fixed?? Dont waste your time.",
      "Very disappointed... Claimed it was for free... I was still trying to figure out how the app works (about 3 or 4 days!) , and the next moment I cannot access anything if I do not pay a subscription fee. That to me is not free... I see that as dishonest and false advertising. Unless I did something wrong somewhere....."

      "For my purposes, the Android edition of this app (is) inferior to the iOS edition, for a very specific reason:  It DOES NOT wake up my PC.  I like the app so much, I was even willing to purchase it a second time- this time, in the Android side of the world.....for those times when I'm remote and my Ipad doesn't have a network connection.  But now I see, that I'm still going to be stranded unless I get my Ipad onto a network... to issue the wake-up call to my sleeping PC.  If/when the developer fixes this deficiency, I'll update this review, but for the moment, I cannot endorse the Android app as strongly as its iOS counterpart.  Update:  The developer has assured me; a major update to the Android app is underway, that will address this shortcoming.  (I neglected to mention- the developer [is] responsive.  I've made about 4 posts, and all were answered within 24-hours)",
      "Installed it on my S9+ few months ago, don't recall using it on this phone. Noticed that I am running out of space on phone storage and decided to find what is using it. Imagine my surprise when I found Jump ate 20GB !!! Had to clean up application cache via OS to reclame back the space consumed by app that shouldn't be even running if not used. There is not a single host added to it either.",
      "I really like this app a lot. I have it installed on all my macs/windows desktops because I prefer to have a single POE for all my computers. This way I don't have to carry multiple laptops everywhere. The only thing I have a problem with is running it on my Chromebook. I don't have the option to map my ctrl key to the cmd key when remoted in and the screen doesn't seem to scale correctly. I'm hoping for an update to resolve the chromebook issues since there isn't a specific chorme OS version."

      "Wow.... Almost any card needs alot of adjustment. There is no intelligence eat all. Like matching first name and first name in mail address or that usually streets send with the word street and not s1reet. (German edition) and there is no matching with any kind of dictionary. The scanning process is full of bugs. I am very disappointed. It would have been a great app 5 years ago. But it needs alot of improvement 😳",
      "I was a happy user for MANY YEARS. However, this app has taken such a TERRIBLE CHANGE. TOTALLY UNSATISFIED NOW with the state of the paid app, since they now want a monthly subscription for most of the features we had with the paid version. Now MOST OF THESE IMPORTANT FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS HAVE DISAPPEARED, and only available with the MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION VERSION. I feel totally BETRAYED BY CC for this move. Can't find enough words to describe how badly CC sucks now. Look at the plethora of 1 star reviews recently on APPGROOVES for this program now to see what I am talking about in more depth. In all my years since the beginning of Android apps, I think that what CC has done in their change is by FAR, THE BIGGEST CASE OF BETRAYAL TO THE CUSTOMER BASE in a move to $UCK MONEY FROM OUR POCKET$$$. If they had started with MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION like this in the beginning, and we knowingly bought into this, then I have no grounds for my BEEF. But to have a HUGE USER BASE, tied into the CC ecosystem, and then to switch to this business model, WITHOUT LEAVING US WITH OUR PREVIOUS FUNCTIONALITY IS THE WORST HIJACK HACK FROM A COMPANY THAT USED TO BE A GREAT APP. HEY DEVELOPER, how about giving your old customers the option for a refund of our paid app IF WE DON'T LIKE THE SWITCH TO SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. Unlike Microsoft that switched office to a paid subscription, at least MS left their old programs that were PURCHASED, still TOTALLY FUNCTIONAL. NOT THE CASE WITH CC. Can UNSATISFIED USERS HERE recommend what you have replaced CC with??",
      "Finally I have no lost business cards and all contacts at hand, shared with all my company executives. Definitely recommend. But don't forget that the provider of this app has history related to viruses. Well I have no extremely sensitive data, but some of you might.",
      "I would say this has a 95% failure rate at actually putting in the right information. I always have to check it then fix it.",
      "Awesome app, just not so lekker that i dont have my premium subscription anymore. Not sure what happened to it"

    "description":"digiPunchCard - digital punch card is a cloud based loyalty CRM platform for retailers. \r\n\r\nFor your clients, it replaces the the familiar \"Buy 9 get one for free\" paper punch/stamp card that always tend to get lost or be forgotten - the same but digital. \r\n\r\nFor you, it is a powerful social loyalty CRM platform that drives new customers into your point of sale. It connects with your Facebook client profiles and your business fan page including friend referral campaigns. \r\n\r\nFor more info, please visit our site: http://digipunchcard.com\r\n\r\nDigital loyalty programs are emerging into the market as the most effective way to promote businesses and encourage returning customers. Previously, the digital loyalty system was reserved for large companies with a dominant online presence, leaving small businesses out of the game.\r\n\r\nMany small businesses operate loyalty campaigns through flimsy punch cards, a system that, while effective to a certain point, is significantly limited.
