      "Excellent overall. Two comments for improvement. 1. In areas of intermittent poor reception, zoom has trouble reconnecting, and under such circumstances it should prioritise sound, at low bit rate, and increase quality as signal improves and then add video. 2. When connecting via Bluetooth in my car, the sound seems to get channeled via the \"telephone\" function of the car radio, and not the Bluetooth audio. This is a poorer quality sound output.",
      "I've used Zoom for a business network group spread across the US & Canada and it has allowed us to meet and discuss issues weekly. ... Almost like having a face to face. Being able to share screens and computer program info was especially helpful. I've also used it for personal conversations with friends and family. Rather fun to introduce them to this technology. Simple and intuitive to use.",
      "Most reliable and complete conference call app. Been using this for years and it never fails me. Battery & data consumption is quite high",
      "You could use a better UI on PC, especially on Mac/Linux. Other than that, probably the most enjoyable video conference tool Ive I've ever used.",
      "I currently have a facebook group and I thought this application would make things easier for us to put on group meetings and have discussions. I find it difficult to add people to meetings and get things organized the way it would work for us. I think maybe I don't know all the ins and outs of it yet but it seems like it's a pretty good app. I don't know..."

      "The app is alright. When the presenter's connection is terrible we are never able to see the screen and such. However, if their connection is good, then the quality is actually not bad. Although, I would like the creators to add a “(s/b) is typing...” bubble when someone is typing. This will prevent any unnecessary anger grunts from our teachers when the class is not answering their questions, even when someone is typing as fast as possible.",
      "Has worked flawlessly for me for quite a while. Lately, sound quality is even decent on low bandwidth connections. Audio can be difficult to understand if presenters use cheap phone microphones and stand far away, but you can't blame the service for that.",
      "App is great, but the output volume is too loud on earphones even when my phone volume is set to it's minimum. I have to take my earphones out and set them near my ear to have the app not screech into my eardrums. An option to adjust output volume in-app would be really useful.",
      "Chaotic, laggy, plain unorganized. Do not get this. I was excited the first time I saw this app, now I know I'm being led to dread whenever I see it. Its just crazy to the limits. That morning I had art class, I couldn't hear anything and even when I could it was bad quality. I had to sit there for about four hours listening to the disturbing sounds of people shouting and voices lagging. If you ask me, that was a one star experience.If you think this app is good by the outside think again.",
      "I don't even understand how Google's own app doesn't work on Android. Every time I try to join a Hangouts meetup, I get an error message and cannot join. Re-installed and re-started phone to no avail. This app deserves negative stars. OnePlus 7 Pro"

      "I never tried the phone app, because after I tried the free PC app, it was non-intuitive, buggy, & all-around AWFUL. After once getting it to work w/ a video conference, I deleted a user & then tried to add him back but couldn't; the user activation emails did not work. I'm willing to try again in the future, once they get the problems worked out. Oh, & it should install once for ALL users on a PC. I've recommended to the county emergency mgmt team I work with, to use Zoom for the time being.",
      "I love being able to be connected to work for emergencies. I can set my status and it syncs up to my calendar no problem. My company uses multiple platforms for communication. But I do think switching everyone to Microsoft teams would be very beneficial. I have not tested much of the group video conferencing. One feature that I do really like is that you can give someone access to your computer through teams to fix quick problems or collaborate.",
      "With the COVID-19 outbreak, my office had to scramble to figure out how to work from home. Our IT Manager kept saying we we underutilizing this program and he was right! You can use it on multiple platforms - computer, tablet, phone. Awesome chat feature - so it streamlines conversations, use instead of text or email. Share and edit files with your partners, you can edit the same document together. Use Planner to assign tasks. Link a notebook people can share their research, project ideas.",
      "I love Teams in theory. It's way easier than other systems to pull your documentation, meetings and general team collaboration together. However, the biggest issue is not being able to have multiple windows or tabs which means you lose all context if you need to quickly shift from a chat to a doc or have both open at the same time. Also, the complete lack of integration with Adobe around pdf documents means you need to download pdf docs every time as opposed to opening them natively.",
      "I love Teams. I haven't mastered it yet, and I know there is so much more that can make me more productive at work, but it's easy to use, and making the transition from IBM Sometime and Lotus Notes to Teams has been an easy process. I really like how quickly it synced up with my Office 365 account on my work computer, laptop, and my phone. It keeps me in the knownwith my staff and my colleagues, and allows me to share progress on various projects quickly and easily."

      "Mostly works better than Skype or any other video chat app I've used in terms of video and audio quality/stability. But for some reason, my video was really dark. It doesn't look that way when using the Google camera app on my phone. So I guess this app must have some sort of proprietary camera app built into it that doesn't have the ability to auto-adjust the exposure based on how brightly lit the subject is. BTW, I'm using a Pixel 2 running stock 8.1 Android OS.",
      "The UI is clunky and unintuitive. Chat is hidden behind 2-3 taps depending on how you access it. Picture-in-picture doesn't work correctly. It's either way too big, or compressed and the buttons don't work. It switches off. The video quality is pretty good though, as is the tooling. MS Teams is far better though.",
      "We started using the app with my teachers and classmates about 3d ago, due to COVID19, school's shut down & it's still unknown whether we'll attend physically. The only problem I've met so far is the audio being cut here and there occasionally• the app says \"low network quality\", although I'm sitting next to the router & my carrier network is 4G at all times. In overall, it's an easy app to use & understandable by its audience. I really like it & hope the minor bugs will be fixed soon.",
      "I absolutely love this product. The recent support of the current situation in the world and availability of this tool for free. Priceless. I have given my sister's school district that's severely underfunded and did not have a continuity plan or the tools to resume business. To collaborate between 7 remote rural locations on any platform or mobile device available. Being able to gather collectively, share information and visualize the path forward. Thank you is inadequate for the gratitude.",
      "It's the best or the most convenient but perhaps helps in getting the work done. I would like to add a point specially for developers is that there are certain issues in connecting or joining the call however once joined it works usually fine. So what I would say here is improve the ways of joining. 1. It doesn't work when we put name i.e. abc.xyz like in case of desktop version which also shows last joined WebEx helps in easily connecting. 2. Not all calls are synchronized with outlook."

After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (TFA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (TFA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more.

Finally, you’ll enter the one time password (OTP) provided by the Microsoft Authenticator app.\r\n\r\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.

      "The reason I prefer this app over the big G's one is that this one has cloud backup. If you've had issues with Google losing your info due to server issues or, more commonly, lost/stolen/broken/new phones, you'll know how invaluable it is that Microsoft allows your credentials to be backed up so you're not locked out of everything. I had this as a one-star review because of a security flaw that was fixed REALLY fast by Microsoft. That is great and another reason to recommend this app (Google had the same flaw, no idea on if theirs is fixed, but to anyone using their authenticator, you REALLY should make sure it's been patched). Overall, straight up usability of the few authenticators I've tried, I really do prefer this one quite a lot over the others. It does what it should. It's quickly patched in case of security flaws. Super recommended.",
      "Works very well as a two-factor on logins, the notifications pop up automatically and require you to pick from three different two digit numbers, matching what prompted you on the login attempt.

      "When I got a new ISP Microsoft did not recognize the new IP address on my pc and asked me to log in. To do so it required verification from this app. Since this app is not used on a regular basis when i opened this app it asked me to re-login, which i could not do since the useless app asked me to verify my identity, by using a verification code from the \" microsoft authenticator app\" Utterly pointless",

      "One thing about my experience was that the video feed kept shifting from person to person, in a random, unorganized way. Plus, the more people that talk on the video conference, the harder it is to hear any sound at all. at least that is the way it is with phones, but I do not know how this app works on computers. Finally, this app could include functions that allow pictures and videos to be shown, in an organized way.",

The problem only occurs with \"Go-to meeting\" application in Windows desktop version. The audio is not audible. I hope your team will address this soon.",
      "Very positive alternative to face to face..during coronavirus time..first time user of web meet type conference call..7.5 out of 10....I found difficulty toggling between my phone audio and camera visual but maybe as first time and had phone on initially then computer...maybe the graphics for boggling etc could be made clearer etc but overall good..able to use without downloading in my laptop which was a bonus...surprised how good it was....",

      "Bug: On the My Network page, when scrolling, if you scroll within a section of the page (say, for people you might know from work) and then attempt to continue scrolling by touching the screen inside the area for another section of the page (say, for people in your area), the app's response is sluggish, glitchy and generally non-responsive until scrolling has stopped. Sometimes it fails to scroll, sometimes it scrolls disproportionately and sometimes it scrolls after a delay.",
      "It's show for updates every time. I don't know what are you changing day by day. Before few months I was running so better than nowadays. I am irritating to use this app. I am making some distance to use this because of updating every day. And after updates while I open the app then it show network issue. Why its happening.?",
      "I appreciate the efforts of developers for constantly upgrading this app but forcing me to update this app every few months that is what irritates me the most. I was very much comfortable with the features and interface that were there a couple of years ago. Because of the annoying push notification of update was what drove me to uninstall this app. Any how am back now only to see many more irritating features. Cant say when would i do the next uninstall maybe for good this time.",
      "The app itself is very useful, but for a long time the scrolling on \"My network\" section has been malfunctioning, lagging and jittering all the time. The \"My network\" scrolling is unresponsive most of the time, which is something that doesn't happen on iOS. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible, as it ruins the experience for Android users.",
      "Few years later and I don't see any development in this app. Yes, the idea is good and this is what makes me still use it but I am so disappointed. Recently I removed some connections because I am no longer interested in their accounts and you know what? Now they are all in the \"suggestions\" section. All I see is the faces of people who I just have removed. Great! In addition I moved to a different company/industry but I mainly see contacts from my previous job/industry."

I tried to send a message while offline expecting the message to be cached for later when I connect, but now the person I sent the message to appears at the top of my chats with an exclamation mark (!) and I can't seem to make it go back to normal! Also, the Mac app could do with a caching-until-online feature 👍🏻 cheers, -O",
      "I use this for coordinating D&D games I run. It is a brilliant, low impact app that allows for conversations with groups of players or individuals. Allows for session planning in common rooms, Witcher meme postings, polls as to who are the most pizza last game, and allows me to flex my DM skills by sending private messages of doom and wonder! Ahem, I mean it is nice getting one on one alerts with people.",
      "Buggy but it will do... If you close a private message in the app, it will just open back up when you open the app next time. Clearing the cache will make them instantly come back without leaving the app. So I'm stuck with a bunch of names on my list. They're not drafts. They just won't go away.",
      "It's OK but messages are delayed on mobile. After receiving and viewing them on Desktop I still get notifications (after I've seen them already) and they never dissappear. Also would be nice to have a way to set notification preferences per app instead of channel only."

Everytime I try to open it up, it tells me that it's \"Missing Libraries\". I've Googled the problem and it seems I am not the only one having this issue after updating. Microsoft is pointing the finger at Chromebook support.",
      "A necessary mobile application to have when we need to attend an official call or talk to a colleague in case away from desk. However there are few issues faced as well at times like- 1. Sometimes the call gets stuck. 2. In case we are logged in to both mobile and machine, some messages get lost in transmission or half of msgs get delivered at either locations. It is not consistent. Overall a good app to have in situations.",
      "So far it is good if you often have to talk to your colleagues when away from your desk. The problems I have are: 1. If you have a continuous discussion when in and out of the office, you cannot see your exchange on the desktop when on your mobile, and vice versa. 2. The quality of your call varies: not so good when on mobile internet, but really good when over a stable broadband. A couple of times a crucial call from our executive was so broken up, I had to ask his EA to call me on mobile.",
      "I already updated my Skype for Business to the latest version, 6.27.0.12 but I still can't view meeting content being shared or presented by my peers. I am getting the error \"Someone is presenting content using a sharing or recording feature that your version of the app doesn't support right now.\" I sent an e-mail to the developer e-mail address indicated but it bounced back. Can you please assist? Thank you.",
      "Why did I buy this laptop?? Nothing works on it and for a person who works remote and needs certain applications, this system is useless to me. Can't wait to replace it with a windows based application. All I get from Skype for Business is ' missing libraries'..what does this even mean?? Your tech support cant even give an answer. This stinks!"

      "Never have any issues with this platform while have had significant issues with others. Very easy to use. No distractions such as comments from other participants so one may concentrate on the information presented. Easy to ask questions & obtain help, if ever required. Sound automatically connects while others do not & volume is at one may hear without difficulties. If there were previous kinks all, if there were any, appear to have been resolved as never have issues when using GoToWebinar!",
      "So helpful and It has so much great ideas. It has so many ways of helping you to understand. What you can do with your Center or your daycare or your program it just give you a full understanding of what needs to be done and how you can do it the right way. You just have to go on there to find out for yourself. And always try to listen and join under meeting.",
      "I didn't know about this app before but I was scheduled to attend a webinar on it. Didn't know what to expect because sometimes when you try new platforms they drop or lag but it was very easy to use and had no issues. I had it running on my phone while I was driving and when I got to my office it worked just as well on my computer. Have another one scheduled next week so I'll follow up on that one but so far so good.",
      "I have sucky signal where I live (and no cable companies have coverage over here), so I dreaded going in this with my slow service, but surprisingly, the video hardly lagged and the resolution was phenomenal. The Webinar's are also very awesome, as well as the people hosting it. So far, I'm impressed."

      "The indeed app is working great so far. I have gotten good results so far. It easy to apply for job searches. And it gives you the opportunity to look for other employment while the other searcher are looking at your resume. I think if someone is looking for employment get the app indeed, 9 times out of 10 you will get great results. And hopefully employment will be in the near future for you. A great option that I like, is that you can save a job and look at others and apply for them later on.",
      "Great app that makes it easy to apply for several employers at once and make the best decision about careers and jobs in your area. Overall pretty cool service and it's free for people looking for a job. You'll run into hiccups ocassionally with the app but that's to be expected with an app that has so much to offer. It's easy to understand and use. Simple but good. As long as you have an up to date Android OS you should not have too many problems with it.",
      "I've had some really good luck finding jobs with indeed it's super easy to use it doesn't overwhelm your phone and you usually get a response from the employer within 24 hours or less. It's real easy to edit your resume and just use the resume you set up on the indeed app. I usually only apply to jobs that use that feature on the app that makes it way easier!!💪",
      "Was great until a few days ago. Now it makes me re sign in everytime I open it. Sign in again to apply. My original searches were gone. Still has my resume fortunately but it sure has lost a lot of its convenience. Update 3/18 The app quit on me while I was updating resume in the middle of applying for an internship. Now I get to start over. Correction, app has seemed to crash and will not open anymore. Yay.",
      "The app has been helpful most of he last few years. But over the last few weeks, everything has fallen apart. Indeed signs me out regularly, right in the middle of me applying. It also deletes my recent searches and settings. I have been very vocal about recommending this app, but it is now causing me so many problems that the only reason I ever used it in the first place (user friendly interface, ease of one click apply, etc.) is going to be why I uninstall. I love Indeed. Please fix this."

      "It's so irritating to use. This app doesn't work half the time. When it does the punch doesn't take. The location is off, will tell you \"you are not close enough to you desginated location\" but you are litteraly standing in the middle of your work place. All the fun/easy options do not work. I have had to uninstall and redownload so many times now and I've only had to use this thing a a little over a year..",
      "Horrifying experience compared to the PayCom app. The interface is poorly designed and not easy to navigate. It's hideous and not at all intuitive. Feels like the entire app functionality was an afterthought to the developers who focused more on creative ways to display Wisely ad's. I will be leading the campaign for my company to go back to PayCom.",
      "I reset my fingerprint and put in my password just to have the app tell me that was not my password. I tried again and got the same answer, so I went to reset my password just to find out I couldn't use that because it was my existing password. WHICH IS IT!?!? *** Well again I had to reset my password and again it decided not to take it and lock me out. Same problem different year. You'll just don't give a dam do you?",
      "This app locks me out every single time the password expires. I successfully change the password as requested with no errors, then when I log in again it locks my account. Well, another contact coming up to the administrator. Doesn't matter how I rate the app really does it!",
      "Hoping this app goes up from 3 stars. I just downloaded the app for my job, and is supposed to show my paycheck info, tax info, benefits info, and etc., per my employer. So far only see my paycheck info, as my benefits aren't available to me quite yet. Based on the reviews I am reading, I truly hope none of that starts happening. I see where ADP responds with your employers HR is in charge of all features you have on your app, but I can say the employer is NOT in charge of how the app functions."

      "I am sooo glad I found this app!!! It is super easy to use. It automatically opens up to allow you to get right to scanning. I love that you can clean up the image, like fill in a corner that has a piece of the background or erase creases. I had been putting images on a document and then saving it as a PDF, but the quality was not good, as I am sure you can imagine. I can now send professional scans. Thank you Adobe Scan!",
      "Alright I take it back, they implemented a great share system similar to the Acrobat Reader app. My last preview is below. Congrats to the developers whole improved it, I hope I helped. Previous: [ Great scanning aweful sharing. 3 stars just because it has been like this a quite a while and it is pretty bad. ]",
      "This App falls into 2nd place after CamScanner, which I've been using for several years.. This App does Everything that CamScanner does, and is (Free), the scan quality is as good as CamScanner. To get the same features in CamScanner you've got to get the paid version.. If I would of come across this App before CamScanner, I wouldn't have paid for CamScanner..",
      "So far, so good. This is my second time using this and it's so helpful. I no longer have to find a scanner, connect to internet, scan in my files to my email, and make sure all is good. This app captures exactly what I'm needing.",
      "This is a very good app, but I have rated it the least because it does not have an option to disable automatic uploads to the cloud, or to disable uploads at all. I will eventually uninstall the app once I find an alternative app that won't upload my files to the cloud."

The very first app worked great but now they want a push and a text number. I CAN'T get it. Change it so everyone can use an app no matter where they live. Tomorrow on my day off I have to go to the store, log in, and print off my schedule. I live 30 miles away to the store.",
      "I cant even get into the app. I've signed in several times and its error message every time. I'm lucky I have the even app so I can see my schedule. It's a great idea but the execution isn't there. I just want to see my schedule and not have to worry about 2 step verification every time I log in. If I can even log in past the error message. Also when I'm at work I dont have time to put in a ticket. I'm there to work.",
      "I have had problems with the app. It looked like a good idea but no. After I installed this app I can't access the other schedule app and can't sign in on the walmartone website with my login info. I even did a factory reset on my phone to see if that was the problem and the same issue comes up. The screen pauses at the \"send push notification\" page so I can continue but nothing happens until it times out. I was hoping to use the app but now I can't do anything related to the wire.",
      "Doesn't work. Seems the more \"updated\" apps and systems implemented, the worse it gets. You have to jump through hoops to maybe get into programs, then you just see failures. Takes more than act of congress just to see schedule, unable to print off month view, can't get paystubs easily, etc..... & to add insult to injury, unable to look @ this information at store location unless you're clocked in. So going to personell on day off is useless to get help, & night personell are out of luck.",
      "I was on the usual schedule app when it said this app was here. Decided to check it out. After installing this app, I cannot sign into it at all to even see what the app is like. It just keeps saying it cant Retrieve my profile after putting in my information. I know the information is correct because I can sign into the My Walmart schedule app. I'm just gonna uninstall this since I can submit time off and what not from the work computers."

      "Love this app! Been using it to send my 9y.o. son's work to his teacher via email during COVID-19 lockdown. Works perfectly. If it doesn't capture the entire image, it allows you to adjust. You can batch or single scan. Has ads, but easily closed out after a second.",
      "As mentioned, this app truly feels like it's trying to scam me out of $50. Less than 72 hours after the start of the 3 day trial, I was charged. No warning. No email. Nothing. Absolutely not okay. 3 day trial? Ordered on the 16th, charged on the 19th. Less than 72 hours, THAT'S NOT 3 FREE DAYS. I've used the free version and watched ads for a while, but I'll definitely be uninstalling this app now. Disingenuous and exploitative.",
      "People who want to cancel the subscription -- you cancel it in the playstore, not in the app itself! Click on the app and it should say under Uninstall and Open buttons \"Manage subscription.\" You can follow the instructions/prompts to cancel from there",
      "Easy to be honest! In managing or removing your subscription, press \"manage subscription\" then unsubsribe here within the playstore at the open option above. Tho, needs improvement in some already understandable letters, it sometimes converts numbers to letters. Yet, overall satisfied!",
      "Good app with a scam to get you on yearly subscription for a high price. Just wanted to check it and found myself now struggling to get a refund from the developer. Feels like being cheated. Will not give a good review for such a behaviour."

      "Doesn't save my searches or save any jobs. Always freezing or crashing. I can't even upload my resume. I've tried updating from my phone, google drive, and dropbox. For some reason it keeps saying the upload failed and it is not because of the size or format. Every time I attempt to put in the information by typing I just get a blank screen and it freezes up. I can't even see what information/email I used to sign up with so that I can just try and do it on my laptop",
      "The search function does not work right. I would like to search for jobs across the country and the location setting is \"(optional)\"; however, it will not conduct a search unless you put in a location. It becomes very tedious to have to search city by city. This should be corrected. Also, the instructions for closing an account lead to a bunch of dead ends. There are no close account options under the profile settings as noted in the help section.",
      "It has been somewhat easy to use but definitely still needs improvements such as allowing me to file jobs that I have applied for into its own category so that when I get a response from employers, I can go find the relevant job description for reference (the existing \"Applied Jobs\" tab is useless). Jobs by proximity doesn't seem to do much help."

      "The update has many improvements but one major drawback. I love that you can switch between separate screens for hosting and joining conferences but there's an issue. When you host a meeting, unless you sign out, in every meeting that you \"join\" (rather than host) after, you appear by the name of the meeting that you most recently hosted. On the other hand, if you do log out entirely, unless I'm missing something, you lose the list of the previously joined meetings.",
      "For the fact that it free without ad, wonderful, I've just discovered it for church meeting during this Coronavirus that it wasn't possible to meet at church hall in Italy. It helped us meet even as far as we are from each other. May the Lord God bless and promote your organisation as you render platform to share the word of God and prayers.",
      "Ive been using this conference line consistently for over 3 years. Most times 1 time a week and every quarter 21 days in row. No matter the conference line is always available. Members get on with ease. Very little issues and for the most part it is flawless. The new app upgrade is also sleek. Its better to use app because some phone carriers charge 1 cent per minute for calls. Other than that minor issue I am grateful for the line.",
      "Equal to or better than Zoom, Go to Meeting, or any other platform I've used over the past 20 years. Fantastically blessed through this phenomenal, free, world class quality platform. I was introduced to it through my church when our pastor initiated a daily prayer line meeting for our congregation. That was 10-15 years ago and it is still going strong. My next opportunity came as a teacher. We use this regularly to collaborate throughout our school district, region, and state.",
      "I may change my rating to 5 stars after video conferencing with it for the first time :) FCC is really a blessing because many people and smaller groups don't have the resources to pay for quality conferencing services. The reports and follow up messages were a pleasant surprise. The download took 2 minutes; all other apps that I have used, whether for entertainment or communication, took 1-2 HOURS. I will make my donation this week and encourage my friends to do the same. God bless you, FCC!"

      "I have the service and even though it seems to work for other people, I have inventory of items I sell @ physical locations and and online presence which is still under development. I have set the two locations and square is syncing with the website with no problems. We work weekends only at our mobile physical location and every week I have to call technical support in order to address inventory irregularities. Either there is stock missing or items are added to my present stock. It throws inventory out of whack and I have to spend hours reconciling inventory. I have made my case with Square technical support, this is now my third time, with no resolution to the issue. The technical support team that addresses the issues at level one are very well trained and very professional, however they have issues on the backend with a business such as mine. I am just getting started and don't know if this is going to work for my business, I am reluctant. I have less than 100 products and I cannot imagine as I scale my business what nightmares I will go through with the inventory issue that seems illusive the developers. I am looking for something more stable for my business. Unless they get a handle on this issue I will be looking elsewhere. I will give them the benefit of the doubt",
      "The square chip reader has not functioned well for a few months now. Too frequent updates leave it unusable. Have to restart app regularly to get them to connect. 70% of the time it still doesn't work. Really becomes a problem when the card will not work with swipe bc it must be read by chip reader... But chip reader still won't connect, or freezes during processing. Aside from that, pretty good.",
      "Bought a old tablet specifically mentioned under supported devices and guess what, is not supported. Update to latest firmware and all. $40 down the drain. I had to buy it because I made the mistake of updating the app and of course it stopped working on an old iPad I had. Thanks square, you're the best!",
      "Your description of this app is misleading and just plain false advertisement. No hidden fees? How about the the card reader that is supposed to be free, you dont even mention it in your description. I will contact you by phone as well because every response I see here is generic and not helpful at all. I have missed probably over $1,000 in income waiting for a reader that is supposedly on your site even though when you make your account it says we will send your reader asap. You lose too",
      "It works fine but does not at all sync with Etsy. I would have been better off adding adding items in manually & then syncing though Etsy as it makes me have to redo everything every single time, it's so annoying. I don't want to have to re-enter the stock that I have entered and what category it goes in every single time I sync, it's a huge waste of time. Other than that the app seems ok, that just bothers me enough to where if I knew that was going to happen I would have tried something else."

      "Just used it for the first time with about 8 friends who were all using it via apple devices or PC. I was the only one who couldn't see the others. Ridiculous failing of the one thing the app was supposed to do. Yet another example of oblivious developers ignoring Android users for who knows what reasons. It's mind boggling.",
      "After the update it doesn't recognize my headphones, the call dial sound goes to my headphones but as soon as I enter a call it uses only speakers and only speakers is available in the audio devices, can't join calls in public with my phone anymore which defeats the whole purpose. It happens on Samsung S8 +. This needs to be fixed. Edit... the new update seems to fixed the issue.",
      "Quick and easy. Video and audio quality is good. App is heavy and keeps logging out (even desktop app). Echo problems are consistent across the web and mobile. Overall I found Zoom much better",
      "The Audio and Video quality and clarity was the best o have experienced so far compared to other platforms. I just completed a 90min conf call with high quality communication",
      "Very efficient way to connect with team or client, 100% real time video conferencing with zero delay, buffer or any issues"

      "This app is wonderful! Very easy to use, I can track packages that I've ordered, and they make it super-easy to calculate how much something will cost to ship with their awesome shipping calculator. They even give you the option to receive updates via text message whenever your order/package is scanned when going from one post office to another. This app has definitely made my life a little bit easier! I highly recommend it! Thanks 🙂",
      "This WAS a great and useful app until it was updated. I usually had my mail held nearly every month, but I've only successfully had it held one time in the last few months. It's not the post office or carrier...it's the app. I can enter a start date to hold my mail, but when I try to enter an end date (3 or more days' hold), it changes the start date to the date I want it to end. For the \"Hold Mail\" feature, this app is now TOTALLY USELESS.",
      "So easy to use. I tell everyone about it. Update.. Feb 11, 2024.. Still great for seeing what mail/packages r coming. The one thing that's frustrating is even though I select to stay signed in, Iit doesn't n i have hard time remembering username n password..ugh.. Update-3/19/20 can't remem passwords or username n still won't stay logged in",
      "Knowing that you have mail or packages in advance is a plus. So if a piece is not delivered USPS can check on it. I would not have know this without this service. It also helps when you sharecan apartment, which has happen they had a piece of my mail by mistake because they did not check well their mail. Thanks for this service.",
      "I was having problems with my mail after i purchased a P.O. Box it well over a month to get my mail straightened out, to make a long story short I downloaded the USPS mobile app. I love it!! I will receive alerts from the post office when I have mail or a package in my P.O. Box and it will show what it is!! Love this app."

Overall, 4 stars. Worth it.",

As a Realtor I no longer need to run back to the office to scan docs in order to send them to my clients. I am able to scan immediately where ever we are signing and clients really like and appreciate this type of service. This app has lots of great features. Thank you so much to the person or people that created this app that has made such a difference for my business.",
      "Whew! I \"think\" my search is over. Lot's of free useful setup features and lots of one time, under 5 buck, purchases. So far, it's underrated! Try it, then buy the extra features. You can live without them, but why, when the total package is so affordable.",
      "Amazing, useful, it is a game changer! I used this app for YEARS and I absolutely love it. Especially when you don't have an actual scanner. This app really makes your work look like a PDF document. BEST APP EVER! I recommended this app so MANY people, including family and they love it too! Honestly, it's even easier to use than an actual scanner and fax machine!",
      "Excellent App. Turns paperwork into a pdf, gave me a choice of emails, drives, dropbox, and more. Makes going to Staples for scanning pdf's a chore of the past. Just takes a moment to pick up and auto center documents. I love it! Way to go! The perfect modern use of technology."

      "the support does not solve anything, you can call or send email. it's been over 2 months since i reported that i lost my card, my account was blocked saying that i need to activate a new card, i received an email on the 29th of January saying that i would receive a new card in 7-10 days. I have already contacted you more than 5 times, sending email and calling and no one can solve a simple problem.",
      "It's pretty good, but cannot detect when you have arrived or are leaving the restaurant. \"Delivered\" button is easy to acvidentally tap when arriving at the diner's location or gathering everything to take to the door. Should be a swipe or second tap to confirm. It takes days to switch bank cards/accounts. Maps should be better integrated. It doesn't calculate distances or ETAs to the pick up and drop off to help the driver judge if he can make the pickup or delivery on time.",
      "5 months and no improvement! The app logs out constantly. Button to View offers doesnt always work, causing me to miss the order! They offer you orders right before a restaurant closes or you're too far away to get there before closing. Every \"failed\" acceptance or delivery affects your rating and ability to schedule shifts. It has been 2 months since I asked for a replacement Driver Card for orders and have contacted support several times with no response and I cannot accept orders without it!",
      "A bit slow at times. App off and on tells me I'm offline when I am clearly not, once my block got cancelled and I was just waiting on notifications.... Not cool ###update###: OK this app constantly disconnects while I'm either waiting or delivering! I lost several blocks now because of this! I am not going to stare at this app while I'm waiting, I'm doing other stuff and I am always online, you need to fix this because it's a huge pain in the ass!",
      "No longer working on Galaxy Note 8. I uninstalled and reinstalled 5+ times. Restarted my phone countless times. When I try to open the app, it shows a blank white screen for about 5-10 seconds, and then return to my phone's app screen. It closes itself out. It keeps doing this. BEFORE THIS, the app wouldn't constantly log itself out and vibrate continuously with the login screen continously sliding. Thank God I have the Samsung J7, works on that with WiFi/Hotspot. Or else I'd have no income."

      "I have used a wide range of websites and apps in my search over the last two months, and one-click was mostly aspirational... until I found ZipRecruiter. The app is ridiculously easy to use, provided you put the effort in to create a solid and accurate profile. One-click really is one-click on 75% of the roles, and the rest have no more than 1-5 filter questions before the application submits. The instant feedback gives you an immediate sense of how likely you are to get an initial screener.",
      "A very helpful service with a user friendly interface. However as a Canadian, the inability to change the salary denomination to Canadian dollars and the distance calculator to kilometers, I can't give this app a perfect rating. For a service that's meant to be used in Canada, it's very clear that no thought was put into altering the experience for an international audience, which harms the usability of the service.",
      "Great concept. Love the \"1-Tap\" option for filling applications. I can not rate this app 5 stars, as I've yet to land a job, on account that I haven't had appropriate interactions with this site to do so. Just know that I will give this app a 5 star rating, when I do land myself a good job!",
      "I'm one of the last old school so it took me a minute to warm up to it but 1 touch application and knowing instantly when a job is posted. 1 piece of advice if possible once you apply to introduce yourself to them so that got a face to go with the app. Day 2: my notifications have been blowing my phone up all day job offers left and right it's crazy. It's a good feeling when you Have a choice in jobs instead of settling one the first 1 THANKS FOR THE HELP",
      "Needs locations listed more clearly. The jump of 10 miles to 25 miles is actually quite a gap where I am. 30 minutes away vs an hour and a half. Wish they had 15 mile difference. I keep nixing stuff for their locations being too far, and yet that's like the only suggestion they ever make is that location that I always say no to"

      "I don't know what issues everyone else is having, but mine has no issues. In fact, I came to review this simply because I love the new breakdown of pay details. It's very handy and informative! My only complaint is that I have to enter a one time password that they send through text every time I log in. Checking the \"remember this device\" doesn't make a difference. But it's 5 seconds of of my day, once a week. I'll survive.",
      "This app NEVER remembers my email. It's so annoying that I have to enter it every single time I log in. Even if I check the box \"remember me\", it never does. Plus, EVERY SINGLE TIME I log in I check the box \"don't verify my identity on this device again\" and still send me a code by text all the time. I mean, seriously? Not practical at all. You guys need to fix it I'm sick of having to wait for a code and entering that code on the app everytime I log in!",
      "\"Work Day Does Not Work\" The \"remember me\" function does not work. The \"Do not challenge me\" does not work Every time you want to log in you need to log in with email/pass, than wait, than go to a secondary screen for phone confirmation, request a text, wait for the text, put that in, and than log in. Every time. This is my experience both with home office and at work. System is very fiddly and has a lot of issues. Avoid if possible. New updates are useful, but dont adress any of tproblems.",
      "Simply awful...I guess I'm not surprised. Workday on my pc is terrible and they've somehow managed to make the app worse. It's telling me it doesn't recognize my user name or password but doesn't provide any means or instructions to recover it. Everybody I speak to in my hr department tells me how much they hate the system when I call for assistance. If you're thinking of getting workday for your company do yourself a favor and don't.",
      "So, I signed into my account on Workday and I'm not allowed to; swipe around to view the full web page, open any other outside pages, can't pinch the screen to make it fit my 6.7 inch display, not able to rotate the screen, as well as there is NO settings to change the displays. ONLY thing I'm able to do is scroll up and down. Quite horrible, very horrible."

      "This has great potential but missing some important features. First, the windows desktop app should be minimized to the tray button when you press close (x). Now it just terminates. Second it is hard to drop files, sometimes it fails. Third, on all setups, if you have the application open on one setup e.g Android, and you receive a message and you read it, you get notified on the other setups e.g desktop app or browser if your have it open. On other chat apps you are notified once only.",
      "This is potentially the worst chat application available today. Hangouts had more features, and it was barely usable. I seriously wish I wasn't required to use this... it's not even comparable to its \"competition\". Side note: Get your branding together, Google. What is this? Hangouts Chat? Chat? If you don't know, how do you expect us to??",
      "Really bad app. A long list of black text over a white background..... seriously ? Is that the best design you can come up with ? Plus require gsuite invitation.... How do we chat with external people ? Seriously designed by people who never actually use it outside of a software engineering team.",
      "On the web version: Google Chat is a painfully slow garbage with horrible and confusing search tools. Why would here be any different? Poor navigational interface usability, to say the least.",
      "Its like they took Hangouts which is amazing and made the user interface suck. The user avatars are gone. Just a bunch of text over white. Groups are now considered rooms. Someone at Google saw Slack and though, that program is terrible, how can we emulate it?"

      "It is so handy to not have to run to my desk to answer a call. However, the screen stays on / lit up while I'm on a call. So, my cheek opens up other apps. I've even opened up Amazon music & played songs during a call by accident. This also makes it difficult to hangup the call since I can't just press end when I'm done, but rather need to toggle back to the RC app. When I'm on my \"regular\" cell phone app, that app blacks out the screen and doesn't open up other apps during the call.",
      "My company used Flock before switching to Ring Central for our Dispatch to Field comms. I would give it 5 stars if it had a message delivered and message read feature like Flock. It eliminates wondering if the intended recipient has read your message or if you are being ignored. Other than that its really great. Hopefully the Devs read this and add that feature so I can give it 5 stars.",
      "Generally good for basic functions - calling, voicemail, SMS, etc. Sending and recieving faxes is a bit cumbersome, but it's 2020 so it's not a huge deal; and it REALLY needs a way to search call logs from within the app, rather than scrolling through an unfiltered list. Integration with other apps would be nice, as well (MyCase, in my case).",
      "The app has to be on top and the phone backlight on for the voice to transmit. During calls the app must remain the top app open. If I use my phone to do anything else while on a call, my caller loses the ability to hear me. I can hear them however. Also, if the screen cuts off during the call, same result.",
      "I've never had such a hard time signing in in my life. Security codes don't work. Express links won't work with my browser, and single sign in only logs me in to the desktop interface for a few minutes before expiring. Needs to be fixed asap"

      "The older version was better, in my opinion. You were allowed to sign and tell the driver where to place it, and tracking, for the most part was spot on! Now, with this newer version, it sucks!! Rarely does it update, I've only been able to sign for my package once. SUCKS! Update: 19 July 2019 App seemed to be working alright, for a bit. Now when I try to sign for an order it tells me the package I'm signing for is not in my name...app still SUCKS!",
      "I love this app, but it needs some updates, like for example: to let the person who is wanting to ship the package out how much it actually weighs, and the actual measurements of the length, width, and height of the box that is going to be shipped out like for example: 1.75 inches or 1.5 inches, so that the person who is shipping the package out and the person who is purchasing the item or items inside of the box know how much the actual price the shipping is for any box, big or small or medium.",
      "I really like this app. The only issue I have is that I can't delete old addresses that are no longer needed. It really causes problems when it automatically goes to the old address first. Other than that its a great app and I like it better than the other package delivery app I have. Its easier to use and less confusing.",
      "For the most part the UPS Mobile application works great. For those who use it every day to do their business, I am sure it is a perfect tool. For those of us who only use it once in a while, though, it can be quite cumbersome and tedious. Each time I sign onto the application it has been updated and I must relearn, even update my information. And now I've received an email indicating that I may have bought a service in all my confusion.😳",
      "Very easy to use and understand. I've only used it to track my packages because I like to have an idea of when my packages are arriving and because of porch pirates, and it's been super helpful. It's pretty up to date. I can get my package off my porch within minutes of drop off. Just love this app."

      "Last time I used this app I remember it being great, this time (several months later) I am greeted basically no functionality in the app unless you upgrade to the pro version or pay an in app purchase. Basically this app is no longer free from what it seems. It's also littered with ads, including ones that randomly pop up and fill the whole screen. Unfortunate.",
      "Well, I'm waiting for the pop-up adds and upsell, but so far, they haven't come. I use this kind of app for many things. I find it quite convenient and much nicer that many comparable apps. The app I used to use has become loaded with bloatware, pop-ups and it takes way too long to get anything done. This app far exceeds them. I highly recommend Simple Scan and will do so with word-of-mouth as well.",
      "So far for my work requirements from the app. It does really well and recalls old documents as well in case. Keeps each time I access separate which I need. No need to clean sheet it. It does it on its own for me. I just keep taking pictures and it stores, sends as I need. Simple, effective, cool.",
      "App is simple. Too many intrusive ads. Ads will pop out and make it difficult to look at or do anything. Instead of locking up more advanced features to paying customers, the developer appears to have decided to serve ads almost to the point that free version is unusable. It would be nice if the developer could keep the basic part of the app without ads popping out.",
      "Does exactly what it says. Plus it's still free unlike majority of all the other similar apps that started of free but now want to charge for the same service. So would rather use this app which does exactly the same as them but for free. Hopefully this won't start charging once it gets a loyal customer base."

      "I scanned a few documents to try it out. Then it gives you the option to send them through email but when you click send it goes to the motions that the email was sent. It's like they want you to pay the $5 or it takes your documents hostage and won't let you do anything with them. Screw this app, just a waste of time. Why would you pay for an app that you don't know the quality of the scanned documents or if it works at all.",
      "I just have a try and now I've fallen love with it. It is absolutely EXCELLENT! There's a great feature that you can easily modify the gray scale just after taking the photo. I haven't seen other apps can do this such easily. Also, you can use all the core features without purchasing a pro, ads-free! Although you can't save the results to some three-party apps with a free version, but you can simply save it to your phone! Great app! But I will still buy the pro, just wanna support it.",
      "There are lots of options, so there's bound to be one that fits what you need. The UI is simple and ready-to-use, with a very low learning curve. It is a little frustrating to see a few options blocked behind a paywall, but they're really just quality of life functions, and the developers have to earn money somehow. It's just a really good application.",
      "What a huge joke this app, I mean AD is! I downloaded it today, tried it out on a couple papers I need. That was only a few hours ago. I just tried to use it but all I get is a box asking if I want to buy it from within the app, Or if I want to download the pro version. This explains the complaints of paying and then told they don't have pro version. Just a money scam don't pay for pro!",
      "Pro app doesn''t work as advertised. In order to do multiple pages, I had to upgrade to the pro version. When I did, however, both the quality of the scan with the multi-page selection was lower in the ability to actually add a second page didn't seem to be available in the app. So far, I have heard nothing from technical support, so 1 star. I'd rate it more lowly, given that they have essentially taken my money for no good reason, but that's not an option."

      "Pretty cool app! Free and easy to use. Have used the boosters and for opening up a bank account and following the guidelines to qualify for a booster I received $75! It's legit. I NEVER sign up for anything or believe the hype with apps but this one is real. It tells you things you can do locally to earn some extra cash or things to make a more full time income. It's easier than Googling and searching. It's free try it if you don't like it uninstall. I'm going to continue doing the boosters and see what else is available in my area to make extra cash. Btw that extra $75 cost me nothing. I received it for doing something I was already looking to do by opening up an online bank account and spending $25 within a month. No big deal. Easiest money I've ever made. You have nothing to lose.",
      "The app itself has worked pretty sufficiently. But Steady is an awesome concept. I have already received $50 in gift cards from \"Income Boosters\" and it has encouraged me to start doing food deliveries. I'd say the only downfall, though very small, is that they can change the amount you're rewarded at anytime, even if you're in the middle of completing a booster task. But other than that, I've had no problems with the app and they reward exactly as promised. Pretty large amounts might I add. :)",
      "I have had the best experience using this app! I received a $40 Visa card in my email from Steady as soon as I completed my 1st Instacart shop. I actually had completely forgotten about the Income Booster & it was such a great surprise!!! Thank you so much Steady!!! I recommend this app to everyone, it's awesome!!!",
      "Honestly I have played with things like this since I was a teenager and have never found any of them to actually work. Steady far excelled my expectations I receive a $75 E gift card For opening up An online Bank account. Which after a given period of time I assumed I would not receive because it was not Listed on my in progress list, So I reached out to steady and received a prompt reply that they were going to contact The bank To verify and within a matter of 2 weeks i Got the gift card",
      "I earned $15 in a few minutes, just by filling out and completing one offer. Not all offers give cash or deposits into bank accounts; sometimes you get a Visa GC. Otherwise, pretty nifty! (FYI: Deposits and Visa GC ARE NOT INSTANT and can take weeks to receive!)"

Why can I only see a donut graph for my current pay check? When I select another pay period it should show both the graph and the details for the selected pay period. I also liked that you could compare 2 pay periods side by side in the ADP app. This app also feels slow, like it is just a mobile website instead of a native app.",

It should just be one page with all the information right in front of your eyes if you scroll. The app also lacks functionality that is important which normally the website provides. Like viewing company holidays before scheduling time off! Seems to be something common enough to do, but all it offers is a mediocre interface to schedule time off.

Thought this would be an easy way to track my packages that never show up on time. NEVER. Nevermind the fact that every day they on on a truck to be delivered by 9 PM. Really odd considering customer support says FedEx doesn't deliver past 8 PM. Apparently they don't work on Saturdays either in my area. Hope you go bankrupt incompetent asses.",
      "Awful bugs. Have to type in Username and password almost every time, even if less than two hours have passed. Have enabled the fingerprint option in app, every single time I login, to make this easier. Fingerprint option works for my banking and other apps however it does not matter how many times I enable in this app. If my parents didn't order so many packages that I have to make sure each driver will leave, I would uninstall. But I have to check this one at least daily. Can't count on noti",
      "This app is incredibly helpful, I am registered. But knowing where my packages are and when to expect them is very good idea. Sometimes packages need to be signed for, and sent to my billing address. It's outstanding that I can have it held a a local drop off location.",
      "Quick to update the delivery details. Easy to know when to expect your package. This app let me know second that my package was available for pickup. The FedEx office that had my package had it on a cart for me to get it to my vehicle. Picking it up was very simple with my ID. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who is dealing with FedEx for any reason. Such an easy way to deal with the process of deliveries.",
      "They definitely update you the very second something changes with your package everytime. You just need to set it up to get notifications with your package, then your all set to get updates, you can even set it up to get text messages as well for updates."

Then, now i install it again and still the same. I already refresh then it same. I can't see any post in my page. Please help me.",
      "Very delayed updates; though the app notifies me of messages from clients, I don't get to see them no matter how many times I refresh. It has taken up to several hours just for it to update and show me the new messages. Because of this, I am unable to respond to clients immediately, especially urgent concerns. Please fix this! If it can work better in that aspect alone it would definitely fulfill its purpose to help admins who are constantly on the go.",
      "When I first got the app in Jan 2020 I loved it. However, it has only gotten worse with the new updates. I keep getting a million emtpy mobile albums when doing pics. With the newest update I can't upload my pictures in a post, to the album I want. At all. I can't upload videos and pictures together anymore. Videos can't even go into albums. If I attach a picture in post, I can't schedule it anymore. Has to be published then and there. It sucks. I'm disappointed. I love the old version better..",
      "Constantly updating the app but nothing looks different and nothing changes, it looks and operates exactly the same. Another problem is, I can never delete the notifications. I \"delete\" them and they come right back. I also get notifications late. Plus, there's an option to see who \"likes\" your page but why can't we see who's\"following\" our page? I'm really not enjoying this app."

      "Update has been a mixed bag. Though the scanner is noticeably faster with the update, the scanner placement has to be just right the first time or else I have to re-scan. Also, the \"almost done\" text notification pops up but does not connect to my messaging app. I have also experienced app freezing, particularly during order processing. In fact, overall order processing time in the app could be improved. On a positive note, I am no longer having to re-take receipt pictures with the update.",
      "Since the most recent update, I cannot even open the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail. I continue to get prompts for promo orders though. However, as the pay rate has continued to diminish, it may just be time for me and Shipt to part ways. Not worth the two hours of driving, shopping, and delivering for $11.",
      "Needs improvement. Needs to be easier to substitute items or force add something when the barcode wont scan. Needs to show the price for items as this can help you find the right thing. Needs isle numbers for some stores as the categories system can out two things in the same categories even if they are on different sides of the store. No pay for mileage so you can only accept the limited number of orders nearby. The worst part is support takes 15-30min to get and help. Even on an active order.",
      "They just launched a new version of the application, and with everything digital you have to wonder what they were thinking? Who did they ask for information? Big change, let's give it more color and make it harder on humans eyes. I can't wait to lose more of my eyesight! Why do I have to see my profile picture? The font is smaller! When you created this did you use it as a practical application, or did you think , we want it to look cool! Getting an alert at 50 mph with 60 seconds to claim!",
      "So far the new app updates are working great for me. EXCEPT the issue that I cannot access my delivery history prior to December 2019. Hoping my communications with HQ will get this resolved quickly as it is a necessary tool I use to reconcile for tax prep. I am not the only Shopper with this issue."

Sorry I didnt review you guys sooner because honestly I would recommend it to anyone.",

      "I use this for \"photocopying\" musical scores. The resulting pdfs are always super clear even when my hands were shaking or the lighting wasn't optimal. Adds pop up in the middle of your work, which is annoying, but it's a small price to pay to not have to make a trip to a place where I have to pay to make photocopies. Also easily allows you to send the PDFs via email and a few other apps.",
      "Sure, the ads are annoying, BUT I love this app and it's free! So I can suffer through a few annoying add. However, if there were more or they significantly interfered with the efficiency of this app, I would reconsider the high rating and using the app overall.",
      "This is the best tool!! Far better, faster and quality than the scanner on my printer. I use it for timesheets and photos as it reduces images so they can be emailed quicker or stored. Couldn't be without the fast scanner app now😊"

      "Functional and does what it is supposed to. Needs an option to save username and password. It is a total pain-in-the-ass to have to enter that information every.single. time.I .use..the.app. Also, the load time on the app is incredibly slow. Don't know if that is the app itself or negotiating with company servers to retrieve data. Seems like it is poorly written and poorly tested software that is just barely acceptable to do the task it claims it can do. I really hope that there is an upgrade path for this. Although, I doubt it. I worked in the software industry for 10 years and it always seemed like once a product was out the door it was forgotten and the company and development team were shifted to the \"next great thing\".",
      "This app is god awful. I'm forced to change my password every month and it won't let me reuse passwords I've used before. This leads to me forgetting my password but when you tap the forgot my password link it says I dont have access to that and need to contact a system administrator. Not to mention I have to log in every time I want to use it and it logs you out if you spend more than 10 minutes on the app or if your phone happens to lock while using it so you have to log in again. Terrible.",
      "Horrible excuse for an app. On version 7.0.15 when accessing the server page the page it brings you to... is the exact same page you couldve just visited on the internet had you just typed the server name into a google search bar.... What's the point of your app if it just opens an internet browser? Also the server screen does not adjust to the size of the user's phone so you can only see 1/4 of the screen. Trash company @Kronos hire more testers so I dont have to find these bugs as a user...",
      "Keeps requiring me to use fingerprint for authentication when my phone doesn't even have a fingerprint reader. Absolutely ridiculous app fix it Make it work with the Pixel 4. You guys get paid a lot of money but my company for the access to this fix it updated. I have to uninstall any reinstall the app every single time I need to use it absolutely ridiculous. all we uses this for is to approve our time card and for time off requests, so my company does not need to know my location at all.",
      "I'm having trouble logging in to this app because it's not letting me! It keeps saying that my password is incorrect and I know that it's not because it has been the same password that I've been using over and over 4 a couple of months now and now it's not accepting it? Is the app under maintenance or something?"

      "Tried over and over to have a design made. Very simple requests but they could not understand simple instructions like \"remove the yellow\" or \"replace the yellow with blue\". The original logo requested was red, white, and blue. I guess that red, white and blue and yellow is the same thing in India. I gave up after about 20 attempts.",
      "Not the Kind of app i will recommend for these reasons: 1. App developer not responsive. 2. Sellers can't withdraw their hard-earned money using the app. 3. Log in process is a mess. 4. Sign up process on the app is a mess. The checkout flow is crazy, it will show incomplete order, your card will be charged.",
      "Outstanding experience! However, there's always room for improvement. For instance, the app functionality should be improve to allow seller to see when files are attached to a custom offer request. Whenever I receive custom offer request, I will have to get to my PC to see if the buyer if the buyer attach any file to the request. Happy 10th anniversary to fiverr! God bless the Fiverr team.",
      "I love this app so much. Im always working, always on the go working 100 to 120 hrs a week sometimes. Its nice to have this app on hand when I need to find an artist or marketer fast. Ive bought atleast 12 different orders and havent been disapointed yet.",
      "It would be better if the freelance service provider are allowed to talk one on one with the end user/ clients; at least 2 times, so that he gets a more clear idea about the clients requirements....it will save lot of time for both...else the clients will only get max of 80-85% satisfaction, and he may have to get the final draft done at his end....."

I got this application, and paid for the subscription, because I do a lot of documentation on my tablet for work and grad school.

When opening the documents in Microsoft word, they're often not formatted properly and have to be redone. Very frustrated and will not renew my subscription.",
      "It says * OfficeSuite - Free, Office, PDF, Word, Sheets, Slides & etc *. It's not free at all, You must pay extra to open it. Now i using other applications; Google LLC & Microsoft Corporation way better than this app. And most it doesn't have any Pop-up Ads. i recommend using this app Google LLC & Microsoft Corporation.",
      "Unfortunately another dishonest application described as FREE, but that's a misnomer. Let's be clear, I have no problem with paying for a functioning application, but to date all this one has allowed is the installation of an advertising model. It has not been possible to create even one document for testing. A waste of time.",
      "I could not be happier😁! Microsoft Office is not compatible with my Samsung Notepad. I purchased a MS Office license without being advised it did not work on a Android platform. MS documents work seamlessly. This application is comparable to Office in all ways. I have not found any discernable differences between MS Office and OfficeSuite. I was a Beta user for MS Office back in the Dark ages when I was using a 3-button mouse.",
      "Description says that the free version will be able to open \"apple.pages\" on android.. NOT THE CASE! It requests that you pay for the pro version. I only need to read a document! You have cost a charity a lot of time and effort with this blunder. At least change your description. Falsely advertised."

      "I am being forced to use this app for my pay for proctoring the SAT, nothing else.They ask for too much personal information. I've encountered several glitches. First, I could not enter my DOB, so a rep had to input it. Then I had to ask a friend to verify the info on my passport, an invasion of privacy. When I finally found someone who's willing to enter their info on the site, they were supposed to get an email asking for in person verification of my passport, but didn't get it.",
      "Just a waste of time as the App is totally glitchy and won't allow you to book even if position/gig available. Called several times to correct/inquire the issue but no help and basically told to delete it if it didn't suit me also asked on several calls if it was personal and if I was welcomed never a straight answer and after reading the other reviews I see it's not just me and I ask why not update the app with fixes.... bad customer service!!!",
      "My profile got deactivated after I called and ask why I was still In onboarding process.This app is not what it says. I am certified and sanitation. You will not be able to work with Adia if you do pass the phone interview you can not schedule for jobs and they will tell you why they choose not pick you and there is no second chance for an interview. I called and the told me I was denied.",
      "None of your links work the way they are supposed to. I cannot create a password or change one because the link to change it send me right back to the download page. We should be able to just sign up and create a password at that point. This is kind of goofy the way its set up.",
      "If I could give it 0 stars I would. I tried signing up with google and facebook and it wouldn't let. I then tried with email i put in most info and at the end it said there was an error and I'd have to try again later. Either fix the app or take it down already"

      "Very Useful App+Service, Thanks, But fees/%/tx-time/etc are outrageous/high/long . Any bsns can use Square,etc instead of this . Paypal (full)app does not support old Android KITKAT (v4.4.x) anymore ! please release LITE edition of \"Paypal\" with support for Kitkat . This app (Paypal-Bsns) supports Kitkat, & can Send invoice/bill via email, & can send invoice’s URL/link via your choice of communication medium/channel (Use \"Share\" button) that is/are supported by your customer/client/vendor/etc.",
      "Good app for online business owners or anyone who accepts payments through a PayPal Business account. The search function could be better, but I can normally find the specific transaction I need within a minute or two. You can give partial or full refunds directly from the app, which is something the normal PayPal app does not allow. Another nice feature is the Sales Insights page where you can view your total sales and easily compare figures by the month, quarterly, yearly etc.",
      "This app is really simple & great for the cost. Although I had a few issues that took a while to clear (especially with all that is happening with COVID19) over all I am more than satisfied.",

      "Recently I suggested a different way of punching in besides the handscanner due to the pandemic. Guess what, all they had to do was enable it to be used! The problem is that you lose a good GPS signal inside metal buildings. Not the apps fault. But how about it continuously updates your location or an easy way to refresh your location instead of having to close the app completely and restarting it! Frustrating when it's raining trying to get \"inside\" the \"allowable\" location.",
      "It used to be a better layout where it showed how many hours total for week and per paycheck. Now it is by the day and doesn't even show the total for day, you have to manually add the hours in your head to figure out how many hours you worked per day, and put each on paper and manually add it all up. I hate this new layout and I used to look at it daily but now I look at it maybe once a month because it's aggrivating",
      "This was a convenient app until the last update forced me to change my password and reverify my device right as I attempted to clock in, almost causing me to have a late punch. I understand having to update my password periodically and verify my device. What I don't understand is why it now seems to be a necessity that I verify my device every single time I attempt to use the app. This catastrophic, technological spider web of security protocols has me missing the days of physical punch cards.",
      "Not the greatest. A number of things cannot be done on the app (emergency contacts entering/editing, tax withholding changes, benefit enrollment, employer launched document receipt acknowledgement, ability to complete employer assigned tasks, etc.). These are available on other payroll system apps I've used so I would think Paylocity could do it also.",
      "This app is horrible. It gives no notifications other than that your paycheck went in. They have some type of messaging system where you can post in a feed. The only problem is you never know if anybody else has posted unless you literally go into the app and log in. So by the time you see it is too late. Our employer seems to be migrating to this app and so far everybody hates it."

I hope I can find a previous version on the web so I can downgrade this garbage.",
      "It's not reliable. Why does it shut down every 10 min when I just updated it yesterday to stop it from doing that? I have only 1 other app open. Plus the rider \"use my current location\" is usually inaccurate and people need to be told to add a note confirming where they are actually. New updates are appreciated like texting rider. That is a huge new benefit.",
      "Edit: Problems may have been caused by phone. Location is working good on new S20. Ever since recent Android update on Samsung Galaxy S10, has had trouble with location. Shows trips as straight lines instead of roads taken, which cuts into pay. Also sometimes shows I'm still far away when I'm almost there to pick up rider, letting them cancel for free. I've noticed that I can't set location permission to always but only while app is in use. This might be cause of other problems.",
      "The app is not reliable. I spend a lot of time troubleshooting and making sure the app is updated when i need to be drivng. Support reads from a script. If the app is glitching, support says it's your connection or carrier. Basically, you'll need to uninstall the app, restart your phone and reninstall the app.",
      "Unfortunately I have to agree with the other reviewers. It logs you out and takes you to the farthest point possible to pick up passengers. It has also switched passengers on me several times as I was approaching the initial passenger. I had hoped that the update would fix the problems to no avail."

      "Hi Team, I am writing this with a very big heart. One of my friend installed this app in my phone and entered credit card details without my approval. Today I got charged with Rs 2550 and it was very shocking for me when I saw this message. I was confused where my money gone and then mistakenly checked my play store subscriptions and found due this app my money got deducted. I sincerely request the team to refund my money. Requesting you again to refund my money. Please....",
      "Hi I have Downloaded this App to check its features and they have asked to Use free trial by adding debit card details. So Once i filled up the details , free trail begins but There was no Option to cancel the subscription and now they have charged ₹2550 for me and showing to cancel the subscription. This is totally FRAUD. Kindly return back my money am requesting you.",
      "App makes it seem as though you can edit your PDF files for \"free\", but you cannot. You have to buy the premium version. I will uninstall immediately, as this should have been made clear from the beginning.",
      "Works okay but Dont bother installing if you are only wanting to test it out because it didnt have the option to cancel subscription. Emailed several times and lodged enquiry online - no reply to date. I wouldnt recommend at all."

      "SOLVED! (At least for me!) I was having the EXACT same issues as a lot of other users have described. Turns out, the fix is so simple. OK- from your android phone's home screen, swipe up. Then, you'll see at the very bottom of the screen \"personal\" or \"work\". Tap work. You will then see your Intelligent App there on the screen. Tap that, and everything will work from there! Good luck!",
      "Does not work with Android R/11. I had to upgrade my device for testing purposes. The certificate was automatically revoked on my device and no matter what we do in UEM I cannot provision my device again after removing my work profile. I get an error \"Failed to create install URL\" after accepting the EULA.",
      "After installing the app and entering all my credentials trying to build a work profile, it says that \"you have a new version of intelligent hub\" and asking me to uninstall the current version (which is the only option I have). Yet, once I click on the uninstall button, the entire apps get uninstalled and I do not have the new version on my phone. I have tried multiple times uninstalling it and downloading it again and it remains the same.",
      "So first, the initial issue, new version uninstall issue does not load.....need it for work...THE FIX for android, Hub creates a separate work profile & on my newer android the profile is separated from all apps. So when I go from the home screen to \"apps screen\" at the bottom of the screen are links for personal apps and work apps. Accessing hub on personal apps does not load, just gives option to uninstall. Accessing on work apps, shows all apps including the hub app that loads. It works!",
      "This App worked for me one time and The next week I had problem after problem with this App. It keeps telling me to uninstall and I do it everytime and the same error keeps coming up. My Coworkers have iPhones and their app is working fine..me and my other co workers have Android phones and we all have problems with the App. I think the Developers need to fix this Bug with Android. Thank You. 2/13/20."

      "The app doesn't really work. One of the biggest issues for me was the fact that if you connected your microphone (which I needed to do for class) it disconnected my headphones and then created a feedback loop. There was no way to have it recognize the headphones again and so the meeting would be blasting through the phone with no way for me to interact besides the chat function.",
      "At the first time I used the app for my virtual university class there was no surprise for me that the app is such Low rated. Currently it has lots of problems. To begin with the worst it just doesn't let me to rotate the view so it makes my phone cover stand is useless. This was the most annoying part of it. Second is that for my class our names are in Persian(which is written Right to Left), but the app couldn't show the attendee names correctly. Just hated it at all!!!",
      "Awful app. Poorly optimized with a lot of amateur coding mistakes. Such as not being able to see what you're typing, or even being able to erase it without have to back out of chat. Sound can be choppy and inaudible for no apparent reason, so even doing nothing but listening can be a challenge. Lots of other dumb issues that makes me surprised the app even functions at all. It's nothing more than a garbage mobile version of Adobe Connect. Please just use the desktop version instead.",
      "Adobe needs to hire some UI/UX developers. EDIT: First of all I'm not talking about the website Adobe connect using which is way better than this app, needles to say that THIS APP needs some improvements. 1- it doesn't support rtl languages in the comment section like Arabic, Persian etc 2- it has very basic options comparing to html based version 3- colors are absolutely terrible, for me it was surprising how a company like adobe had made something like this. 4- there is a 500 char limit ..",
      "Not only that Adobe has not managed to move Connect away from Flash on the desktop, the app is virtually unusable. How are you supposed to use the chat decently if you lock the screen to landscape mode and the keyboard is put above the text input field? Boooo!"

      "The tech itself works fine, but the process is cold and off-putting. First of all, asking candidates, especially those with long and/or varied careers, to answer broad, open-ended questions in three minutes or less is ridiculous. In some cases, it'd take me longer than three minutes to explain the scenario. Secondly, the camera offers zero feedback. A person, either in-person or on the phone, will give cues as to whether you need to explain something further, or back up and start over. The app requires you to trust your own judgment. Finally, as others have stated, this has the potential to favor the better actor/performer than the most qualified candidate. If you want someone who can write a script and read it in an engaging way, get on YouTube. The rest of us are busy doing real work."

I have a Moto E5 play. Please fix this issue/issues. Maybe you should find an updated license for your service for Metro PCS T-Mobile high-speed internet. I don't pay for everything unlimited just to have malfunctions",
      "Use to be a great App. Not anymore. Can not retrieve any messages. Messages do not upload to the app. When I receive a call and it goes to voicemail, I receive a notification that there is a message from that number but when when I go to the app, there is nothing to view. This keeps happening. Will give it a five star if this issue is fixed.",
      "The reason Y Ive gotten this app because I have recieved many unwanted calls it\"s no better way than to see who these calls are & where they're calling from plus the times they call n, this visual voicemail USE TO provide this sort info which is the reason WHY I wanted the app WELL its been acting up for awhile not sure Y or what the problem is even when I refresh it, IT CONTINUES not working nor has it shown any recent incoming calls or numbr+continues to apolgize due to not working !!!!!!",
      "This app sucks it keep telling me that voice to text is down and i have not been able for the last two months been able to get voice to text i even refreshed the app and it might work once after that and then i get a pop up saying that its not working on my phone again!! I have a metro service for several years pay good money and problem after problem keeps happening not just with there visiual voicemail but other problems. Just got a new phone recently and i have had nothing but problems withit",
      "I was I was extremely happy with the service untilI, I realized and had someone inform me. That the application was not very secure, and people were using that to track me, listen to me, and spy on me with my camera. Since I wasn't doing anything \"really\", that I needed to worry about. So I wasn't that concerned at all. it really didn't affect me very much. I just was a little Disturbed and upset with the security situation of their company, so I became consernd, & suspicious of there employees"

      "Permissions are a bit strange. You can't join a meeting unless you enable both camera, mic, and give it the ability to manage calls. Last time I checked you don't need any of those to participate in a one way presentation type meeting. Permissions should only be asked for when the relevant feature is requested by the user. Example video and mic should only be asked for when the user turns on mic and video manually.",
      "This app is so frustrating. Everytime I scroll up, it jumps back about 2 days worth of feed and have to scroll all the way back down. Sometimes when I open it, it will tell me that I have no active chats, force close or just not work. I have installed the most recent update, so I know it's just the app itself. Wouldn't use it if I didn't have to for work.",
      "This is a terrible app. I do not go two minutes without it crashing and then crashing my phone as a result. If I scroll up on a convo it jumps to like a 100 messages back. This application is so bad, I avoid using it out of fear of it crashing my phone. If I see a notification from this app, I wait to get to my laptop to see who is messaging me. You can do better than this Cisco.",
      "Why is there no toggle for notification banners? I hate having my phone's audio dimmed with a barely audible sound, but with no quick way to preview and/or dismisse the message. Overall it's a pretty good experience, but the app is lacking basic functionality vs the desktop client. I hope to see message editing and separation of favorite channels soon.",
      "1. Even after call is disconnected the notifications bar shows call is in progress. In this case sign out and sign in back to the app is required to remove this false notification info. 2. 50% of the time this app does not create temporary space for the scheduled meetings. Users whose PC not installed with webex meetings gets frustrated."

      "I mainly bought this because it has an app and I can check on things when I'm not home. But the app is horrible. I've been through all the troubleshooting, more than once and nothing. It freezes all the time, have to restart my phone several times just to get it work, I get a motion detection notification and it won't take me to it to show me. I paid a lot of money for this and I'm disabled and can't work, so this is a huge investment for me. I hope this gets fixed really soon.",
      "If I could give negative stars I would. I cannot play back events via the app on either my Android or iPhone on good wifi networks. After 5 attempts to reach someone on live chat support I was told it would be escalated to level 2 support. Never heard from anyone. Contacted support again and told the same thing. No one ever contacted me. Still have the issue and sent 2 more emails. Still no response. I travel for work which is the sole purpose of purchasing this system and it's useless.",
      "I have a DVR 1080P WD Wired Security System with 10 cams. The app is a poor design. You can't control video play back. You have to play from start to end no jumping to middle of video. so if your continuous recording good luck. Poor interface for pulling up calendar of recorded video. Unable to remotely configure DVR. No remote control of PTZ cams. Tech support unwilling to say what features are being developed/improved for the app and when releases are scheduled. I'm disappointed with app.",
      "Honestly , the cameras are great. This app is terrible. Good luck having consistent notifications, they randomly just stop. Also the cameras show up as \"offline\" constantly. So you have to uninstall and reinstall the app because logging in and out doesn't help. This app deserves no stars. Like I said cameras are fantastic, this app is absolute GARBAGE.",
      "Would be great if only you were able to always view the event selected but after sliding the timeline to the event (red line) you wish to view two or three times, if you try to go to yet another event, it will keep sliding back to the last event viewed no matter how hard you try to convince it that you really want to view the new event you are selecting. Also drives me nuts that NOON on the timeline STILL is labeled 12AM instead of 12PM (goes 11AM, 12AM, 1PM}! Devs, fix it already, please!"

      "This app has been great!!! It has become exactly what I needed, (2 phone#'s-1device) and it works better than par. It has only stopped once. However, I wrongly presumed, that I would be creating a new contacts list within the app for my business customer's and contacts. Instead, my personal contact list was imported to the app. This was a major drawback, and a disappointment. .....I'm sure I'll find the right app for the job tho.",
      "Works Fine. I needed a second line for work but didn't want to bother with two phones. Google Fi and Google Voice don't play nice together on Google Pixel, so I went with this. It's a little more than is want to pay for how often I use it. Plus the interface is VERY basic. But, it does the job I want and I don't want to bother with switching right now.",
      "Horrible app, stay far away. Phone accidentally deleted the app, and guess what, all my business calls and text messages got deleted too! Had many important business deals in there. Tech support (which takes forever to get ahold of) said I cannot retrieve the texts or old number, once app is deleted. Ontop of that, it never sends text messages reliably.Always appears to send, then says 15 mins later not sent.Very unprofessional and bad for business.Constant headaches and problems with this app.",
      "Works pretty well most of the time. Sometimes it completely logs me out. Often, a text message will show up on my list of text messages (previews), but when I click on that preview to read it, it's not in the conversation. Eventually it shows up, but usually it's way too late.",
      "This is the worst app ever I would never get it messages fail to send company tells you to on install and re install the app I've done it 17 times it signs itself out it says session has ended and you have to sign back in with all your information. Today was my last time I am uninstalling. No joy wt GoDaddy App very disappointed that I paid for it I would not recommend it or use it ever again.They responded, said I had a bad wifi/cell signal after the above.Sent pics i had 5 bars = great signal"

Also, how do we create a Google doc?? Old: No heic support. No android share support. Open in is broken. bad iPhone port. Offline inaccessible to other apps.",

If unpaise then *all* uploads (including files previously uploaded) restart ... or I can't get any / all queued files to restart uploading. Too hit and miss - mostly miss - to make this even an acceptable experience.",

That was one of the features that actually worked consistently in the app. If you only knew what that meant [to me at least]. It was like a little celebration everytime I made a sale, but now it's just a generic default notification with no option to even customize. Bummer.",
      "The app runs smooth,but there are a few things that could be changed to make the app perfect! I've had a couple orders go out late,due to watching the time line shown in my \"order status\" area, so just know to keep track of your shipping times on your own, as the app may not show the right day to ship. Other then that, Sell on Etsy app is GREAT!",
      "I use this app a lot while out and about or at work. It's a very useful and easy app to use! I'm able to respond to customers more quickly and see when I have new orders. I can even add new listings fairly easily, though I find there are things that are easier to do on my computer.",
      "App is helpful for general order fulfillment, keeping track of your shop on the go, as well as making minor adjustments to your listings. Still could use some improvements to make it a fuller experience, but overall it's good experience.",
      "Switching between apps whilst typing a message deletes your message and sends you back to the homepage. Prices have to be entered twice whilst making listings. The ability to copy the link to a listing in the app has disappeared. Generally good/useful but some extremely annoying flaws that hinder productivity."

      "The app is great! Call quality and features are reliable and high quality. I love the customization options. The only thing I wish they could add for the android version of the app is the feature to change the main and message wallpaper. This feature is available on the iphone version of the app.",
      "I'm a subscriber for ~2 years. My experience was positive to start and has continued to get worse. Unfortunately, I don't recommend. Phone calls have delayed audio despite strong connection. I've communicated issues and they've persisted. Will update if that changes with this review.",
      "Good App..yet frustrating..helps out alot...but wheres the feature to delete more than 1 message...it either deletes 1 text message or them all...and also the quality of sending and receiving video and photo content are horrible...also why is there a whole other number showing up on my phone when someone calls me...i never know who is calling me",
      "Frustrating. Everything was great until today. I keep getting messages that say to keep your device mobile private open sideline app and call again. IM IN SIDELINE APP. I've reinstalled 3 times now",
      "I Have had Sideline for almost a year with no issues. I use this number for business, so it is critical. Because of a technical problem, my calls were suddenly going directly to my other numbers voicemail without ringing. I then had need to call customer service to get help. Let me tell you, it was an extraordinary experience. I was very impressed. Such real, personable, professional service ! In the end, Dominic had the whole thing corrected in less than an hour. Stellar performance !"

The time entry system is so different it doesn't even look like the same app. And once you enter that section, you have to choose the app and login again to b free able to access pay and messages, etc. I only continue to use it because I don't really have a choice with my company.",

I have had some issues with things not loading or loading very slow. I know this could be my phone or where I am but it has happened in locations where other times it's worked. When it didnt load it I got an error message a reason this hasn't happened lately so an update may have fixed it.",

When I tried to get others to use it as participants in my meetings, it was unsatisfactory for them too. I feel that I was misled by the description of the product on the ezTalks website. Specifically, it does not seem to be supported or provisioned to work satisfactorily within or from lreland. It seems incapable of supporting a meeting with even a very modest number of participants.",

      "This app is appalling! It used to work great and as I use this on a daily basis to get new work on through google i am furious today as for some reason its lost all of my customers messages which i had yet booked in and now have no way of contacting them!!! You can't change the quote page to add customers phone numbers etc and when you change your device which i did last month you loose all of the messages between you and the customer which effects our business massively. I need someone to contact me urgently to tell me how i get those messages back as i may of lost a days work!! I was in the middle of booking a customer just and now they will assume I do not want their business as i can't contact them. The app used to forward their email address and phone number why did this change? We use google business daily to add posts for clients to see and book customers and honestly this is a joke.",
      "Every day I get messages that my business info is updated. I am not making changes. I've talked to customer service but they won't fix the problem. Mostly because they say there is no problem. So, either they're letting someone spam my account or it's just terminally broken and costing me business.",
      "So, there's like no way to access messages... seriously inconvienct. However I am getting calls for my business which is the goal, I'm sure not as many as I could be but it's a good start, but when I click on messages it keeps telling me to install the app, like, yo, I am on the app! How you gonna tell me to get the app when this IS the app.... terrible. Google, you supposed to be like all powerful.... fix this!!",
      "Useful but painful. Has no integration between multiple locations of the same business. Each common problem has to be dealt with separately for each location. Has no option to categorize photos based on events or pin posts or inform customers of other locations. It's very useful to have this app, but everything is just far more trouble than it should be. Equilibrium Fitness",
      "This is my second review of this app. I have never been this frustrated with an app. If it worked it would be perfect but this app does not work. I never get notifications. Clients message me and it takes days to update me. It seems to experience challenges connecting to the internet. The worst part is that there Isn't an alternative. I wouldn't think twice of switching."

I've made sure my galaxy note9 is not shutting it down for power save mode and all permissions are on. Needs avatar photos. And for God sake FIX the contact SEARCH ENGINE SO WHEN I WANTE TO SEARCH MY CONTACTS IT QUITS TRYING TO SEARCH THE WHOLE Dam directory.",
      "Even with proper network, where other apps are performing well, its constantly \"connecting\". I end up force stopping the app. Now the messages thet were in \"sending\" state, are all gone and I have to retype them. Very bad experience. I am not rating 1 because it gets a lot of stuff done for me and not 3 as it may not get your attention 😁.",
      "Apple AirPod Pro minimum volume is deafeningly loud both in app, browser extension and website. Not possible to hide attendee/chat list. Not possible to receive a text copy of all attendees and chat when meeting ends. Contacts not suported by NAME SURNAME, not listed alphabetically. Very clunky to use compared to Slack, WhatsApp. Not possible to create custom groups in Favourites. No simultanous use: audio via phone and screen sharing via laptop/Macbook. No automatic calling of all participants.",
      "I am unable to get notifications on mobile app... It's like every time I go and open my app and check my messages. Kindly look after it. Above issue is happening even after giving every permission to the app.",
      "Ok. Not great. Get rid of the WebViews. Introduce search for chats. Make notifications expandable so you can see more of long or multiple messages."

It was a long tedious process to get it had to submit a request for a token and jump a bunch of hoops and hurdles just to be able to change my address because i had moved and got a new phone. A process that should've taken less than a minute. Took a couple of days. Not a fan. Id delete this app if my job didnt require me to have it. I hate it so so very much and theres not enough room here to properly express it.",
      "Pretty simple and straightforward. I just wish it was better at automatically providing the code, so that using this was more like using the old tokens, rather than always having to push a button to get a new code. Once the app is launched it should just keep providing codes until you close it.",
      "Very nice, simple and direct in its operations. Works flawlessly. Only gripe is that the ball depicting timeouts could be closer to the passcode. A few times I've been typing the numbers only to find they changed meanwhile.",
      "Very reliable and accurate, but I have suggestion to provide an option to extend time manually, so we dont have to wait in the end renew code.",

      "Works great! Broke my old phone that was using and I was having issues with my new phone/new number so I emailed the developer and he gave me a number to call to have my 2 step verification reset, I called and they cleared the information from my old phone/old number and I updated my information in the 2 step verification and it was so easy after that....this is the best app for a CSM to check the store schedule on a daily basis.....",
      "Absolutely God Awful. I can't even log in. For a multi million dollar company, you'd think they'd actually let their employees look at their schedules, but no. None of the schedule apps work. They all ask for a push notification or some kind of code from an app they don't even give the name to. If you press the push notification, it literally does nothing and you're left sitting there wanting to throw your phone against the wall. This is garbage. And knowing Walmart, it's not going to improve.",
      "My last review was 11/18/19.. I thought heck it's been 3 months let's see if they fixed anything. NOPE App still crashes upon Authentication. From the looks of other reviews it doesn't work on alot of Samsung phones which is ridiculous considering Samsung is one of the most dominant phone brands... There is another app to use called me@walmart but I really liked this one :(",
      "App keeps crashing everytime I try to set up a pin other than that it is great but having to log in through the wire and get sent a text notification so I can put in a verification code every time I try to check my schedule is pretty annoying.",
      "I have uni stalled and reinstalled several times and the app doesnt let nor give u an optuon to log in anymore....NOT HAPPY🤬THIS APP IS A PIECE OF S**T🤬If its not one thing,its another with this app!!!Now it shuts down when u try to use the PIN login n set it🤬🤬🤬People...come on...its not that hard to fix🤬🤬🤬DO NOT INSTALL!!!"

      "We use this where I work, and it is more trouble than it's worth. It has to have decent internet to function at all, which is a problem when you're travelling. The in app pop ups cover up buttons, so you have to wait for the unneeded popups to go away to clock-in/out for instance. Make the app function offline, and when you're clocked in the app has a floating tile (like Messenger) that you can put away if you like.",
      "We use this app at my job and it gets stuck on a white screen or when I attempt to clock in, it tells me that I am not at the proper location. My signal has 5 bars and even with wifi, it does not load. It only works less than half the time. My coworkers with iPhones do not have this issue but all of the ones with androids do. I have a Galaxy Note 9.",
      "The app has alot of great features... when they work. My employer uses this app for scheduling and communicating with staff. While those are great features, the messenger component is almost ALWAYS down. This causes a breakdown of staff communication, as many messages are consequently missed, not received in a timely manner, or not able to be sent at all. This app has great potential, but features need to be accessible and functional.",
      "The app has been buggy, frustrating, and poorly arranged for as long as I've used it, however it at least used to work. Recently, I started needing this app again, and yet am unable to search for my workplace, as the entire app crashes moments after the auto search (after typing 3 characters) begins. I hoped this would be resolved in the update I just downloaded, but happens the same way every time. No matter what characters I type, it crashes before I can type a fourth, so completely unusable.",
      "Diabolical , your app is appalling , it constantly fails to load on all of my devices , my friends encounter the same problems regularly . The app throws you out of any app your in to bring you to the dashboard for no reason what so ever . It fails to complete the basic operations it should do . It is substandard compared to humanity. I am afraid this app requires a lot of work to make it even remotely usable it is rubbish It is rubbish"

      "Awful UI. The most common action, reveal the OTP, is hidden behind a tiny (eyes) button. Everywhere else you touch on the screen does something useless and unhelpful. Also, why does it need to be hidden behind a click when the app itself is already protected by a PIN?",
      "Why does a 2FA token generator need the \"Change Network Connectivity\" permission? This app has absolutely no business even trying to control the network on my device, and that it *does* is utterly unacceptable. Recently, I tried to connect to my personal server, and was notified that \"FortiToken Mobile blocked access to that site.\" When I was finally able to get an actual message, I found out it was classifying my personal server as pornography, so refused to let me connect.It's not; I was actually trying to access my personal cookbook, which I keep on there as a convenience so I can pull it up when I want to. As if that's even it's business in the first place. If I was using the actual VPN, on an *active* connection to the resource it was protecting, then I could accept it. But not a Token Generator. For that matter, why am I apparently unable to use the 2FA TOTP generator of my choice (which, by the way, takes up only about 12% of the space that this one does; has an easier-to-use interface; and was developed and released by Red Hat). \"Secure token activation\" Hah!",
      "Unable to set up at all, the error message \"FortiCare: provision code not exist\" is returned upon scanning the activation code or entering the code manually.",
      "Please allow for the app to show in the open apps shortcut, it's inconvenient to have to go into the specific folder each time especially given how often the VPN times out.",
      "This app works until you have to reinstall it by any reason (phone format for example), then all your tokens doesn't work anymore. Even if you use scan barcode or manual. Always say: FortiCare: Provision code not exist."

Haven't had a reply since January when you said you the developers were trying to resolve the issues Yes I do have them turned off, another feature of your app that I pay for that doesn't work and I have to do manually. Cannot send invoices via sms at all now either.",
      "I down graded my subscription but I already have to many clients saved so won't even let me do one invoice. Money for nothing can't even use. This app is now useless. I want my money back.",
      "This is one of the shittiest invoice apps I have ever used. Two and a half years ago, it was great. Since these bozos updated it, it runs slow, and I mean real slow, and you have to hit about 40 buttons to do what used to take one or two actions. Now that the app has recently updated, it has got even worse. It really does suck more and more with every single update. Even with a Wi-Fi connection, as you begin to search for the client's name and the program is thinking, it starts erasing letters.",
      "It works but , I paid for a basic service as don't need more but to many push msg to buy full version Can't clear history so when I inputting same expense ,have to change manually every time cos price has changed If I make mistake at first line, I can't change it once it's been saved, so have to delete everything and write again ? You should do better",
      "Cannot log in at all, can't contact support directly. I need to get into the app to check an invoice and send a new one. One device I have been logged out of and password won't work. The other device it just \"thinks\" and looks like it is logging in, but left for a while will not log in. Both apps are up to date. No way to contact support directly, I just get sent to a \"FQA\" type page, and that suggested problem solves (check password/ make sure app is up date) are not helpful."

      "I love it. It's quick and easy. My card reader came quick. And I was able to start taking payments right away. Linked it to my chime account for instant transfers, making money has never been easier!!! Giving the average person with a business plan the ability to take cash and credit is big not just for the business but the person theirself developing customer service skills during the interactions using the card reader and app! I love it! Keep up the great work!",
      "Works flawlessly! I was amazed at how quick and easy the whole process of payment is with this app and the paypal chip reader/card scanner. Customers are pleased and so am I. Update: after nearly a year of use I am still very pleased with the reader, app and service. I've had zero failures, and any time there's been a dispute (unauthorised charges from a famous social media advertisement \"deal\" etc) PayPal has been very helpful and quick to take care of their customer, ME! GREAT JOB PayPal!",
      "So from day one paypal here has been very disapointing. To start the card reader wouldnt work and took 4 business days to figure out the problem which ihad to find on my own. Now when i run a credit card my money is put on security hold every time for 72+ hours. I was excited to offer this service to my customers but im now regretting this decision and will be finding another credit card processing service.",
      "I used it for several transactions with out a problem. Then I processed a sale that seemed OK. The charge was approved and the customer signed and took her card back.

      "Don't do it: software looks good but isn't. The whole process sucks. Integration with the desktop is flawed. There are three locations an expense can wind up depending on how I capture it. The software's organizational structure is a joke. The exchange rate process loses me money. It has my expense submittal - the largest for my company - slowed to a crawl. I am owed more than $25k. The reason is that the idea of taking photos of my receipts and then dealing with the app is deflating.",
      "Truly pitifully bad app. Crashes every time I attach a receipt or switch into it via multitasking. You can't use it offline (an app largely used by people TRAVELING doesn't work offline?!?). Redoing an itemization of a hotel requires one by one deleting each night and doing it all over. It's SO SLOW in its loading of everything. The list goes on. Very disappointing.",
      "Latest version wouldn't load in Pixel 4 XL. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no luck. Restarting the phone finally allowed me to launch the app. Now that it's back up and running, the app greatly simplifies my expensing workflow which saves me time and allows me to get back to work. The layout still needs improvement, but it might be better than their circa mid 2000's website ;-)",
      "This app keeps crashing when trying to use receipt capture mode. The camera will not focus and is constantly changing the focal point. It is very nerve racking. I have tried deleting it and reinstalling. Same thing. All necessary permissions have been granted. I hope you will dig into the latest revision and find the bugs and fix them.",
      "I really wish the app would stop going \"offline\" all the time. I could be home on my wifi, on my own phone network, or on a public wifi and I always have issues. It takes forever to load an expense and save the receipt and what should only take 45 mins, turns into hours of work. Could please address this issues with your Android app. It would be greatly appreciated!"

      "Excellent App. But there is 2 issues. First, the resolution is very low. Is there anyway to get high quality resolution for the file you saved it. Second, there is no option to make the text words in cirle shape. Is there any solution for this. It's a really good app. But let me know if there is a solutions for the 2 issues that been mentioned above.",
      "Love the paid version! Not only do they have a nice collection of stock logos to begin with, they're also super easy to modify. And if you take want to get creative, you can create your own from scratch! I've been brainstorming for branding and logos the past few days. I've gotten to where I can create quality logos and branding with only 5 to 30 minutes per logo, with great results! 🥳👍",
      "There is no need to buy icons, you can get very creative with what is being offered. But I promise you, you will be even more creative if you get the \"PRO\" icons. Either way it is an app that offers satisfaction to those who wish to have an understanding at the career. Do NOT let this app flop as it is one of the best for 2020 right now.",
      "You can get ALL of the logos on pro that you Have To Pay For on other logo maker apps for FREE. Its a waste of money for what they charge you for the \"pro\" version and seems kinda scamy especially for the fact you can get any of the \"pro\" logos for Free on other apps..:/ maybe w9rth 1.99 or 2.99 but not the 4.99 for sure",
      "Brilliant app!!! Top of the range!!!!! 10 out of 10!!!! In fact it was so brilliant I paid to upgrade it, my original intention was to do it for free but I'm truly truly pleased with my new logo!!! It's very hard to find apps that do pictures of different colour gemstones"

The options are very well thought out and the selection of pictures, objects is surprisingly great!",

This is a decent app to help get you started in designing a logo. I'm using this app to create samples before paying a designer to create an official logo for my business. Upgrading to the Pro is reasonably priced and you get a lot extras from it, so I recommend that.",
      "I use this a lot for transparent backgrounds whenever doing an emblem for t-shirt or something but i also use this for labels and posts and I wish there was a way you could add a picture from camera roll to be your background. Even if it only accepted square trimmed pictures. 5 stars plus a recommendation",

      "Very informative. However, sometimes hard to move through pages,surveys, etc.",
      "The UI and experience is so much better than before when it was known as Jobr. However the website is FLOODED with nothing but recruiter posted jobs. You can swipe left 20 times in a row and see the exact same recruitment agency with 20 different job postings it's insane. Jobr had real jobs from real employers, but now it's nothing but recruiter agencies competing with each other, sending resumes for the same job.",
      "Absolutely rubbish, use indeed, far better user interface and actually show you jobs that you searched for. This doesn't show you the jobs you searched for and when you get the emails, they are miles away from you, I am in the North East and it send me jobs that are for London! I had one job that was not the same job that I searched for! Rubbish app, use indeed!!",
      "The design and user experience is terrible. You're forced to use cards on the main screen which is not good as they are recommendations, you should just be able to browse all at once. I haven't even tried it because I don't know if the app has an algorithm that would remove similar jobs from appearing.",
      "It's quiet easy to use and clean and tidy. The swipe left and right is a great idea. However, the is no place to view my saves cv There is no place to update my email address either. I have also applied for jobs but not had any email confirmation yet so not sure if I have applied for the job or not"
