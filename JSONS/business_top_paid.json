      "It's a nice app that's worth the purchase of the pro version. I haven't even got to use all the full functions yet because it covers all of my basic needs. I've needed an scanning app to store important documents that I shred, and now I'm also starting to use it for storing receipts as well. It's a versatile way of keeping your documents organized with good export features.",
      "Free version is more then enough to use this app to scan in homework assignments documents etc. Simply take a photo and then adjust the image to pull only the portions of the image to create a PDF. From there adjust brightness to final PDF. Choose method of transfer ie email. Pro version allows multiple projects and additional method of transfer I choose to support the app not for the features but because the quality is worth supporting.",
      "Useful tool, I've been using this app for a while and it was super handy to generate pdf files (mainly made out of marked up pictures) on the go to be emailed to relevant people which saved me a lot of time and I was able to attach much more pictures than doing it other way by attaching it individually to the email and being only half way in seeing a message that it's already over 25mb limit... Anyway - this was a brief description for one of many good uses for this app. Thumbs up Dev team!",
      "Does exactly what I need! Many college classes want me to send in a photo of hardcopy my work as a pdf. This app takes the picture of your paper and perfectly converts it into an easy to read pdf that your professors will be grateful for! The free version did everything I needed but I decided to buy the pro as it could directly upload to Google Drive among others. A great app I highly recommend!",
      "This app is great except for a critical flaw: it can't do landscape docs. I scanned 19 pages, flipping each one, just to find they all got cropped and centered in larger portrait pages. What's so hard about scanning a landscape document? Those are not a rare thing."

      "What a great app! Super simple to use - just tick the items you want to disable and they turn off. I had to turn Facebook Installer back on in order to install something, so I unticked it, installed my app, then ticked it again. Worked immediately with no restart required. Not sure whether it has improved performance, but from a privacy perspective I like to turn off all those Bixby/Google/Facebook processes and for GearVR it lets me use it as a cardboard headset.",
      "Didn't work Samsung 9. List that identifies all the bloatware not available after multiple attempts to obtain and save as instructed. Reached out to customer service who responded i.mediately with, \"we don't know which package disabler you purchased\" & that it's only good for about 6 months due to developers changing code, etc. I responded immediately with receipt for package disabler pro purchased that day. No response after that. Do not give device administrator privileges or you can't uninst",
      "The app works as expected on my Galaxy S9 with Android 10. A little disappointed that I needed to buy this app again after the developer changed the name and the old version no longer being updated and not working on anymore. Would be a five star if not for that. One last point, it doesn't seem to be able to disable packages inside of the secure folder, but that might be a limitation of Knox.",
      "It lists bloatware and there are boxes to check, but if you go to the drop down menu, there's no setting to disable the app you check and there's no info on how to do it. If you tap uninstall, it uninstalls package disabler pro instead of the app you checked the box for. I would appreciate some advice. Thanks",
      "It's a great app and does what it's supposed to without rooting. Been using it since Note 4. But I think this is my 3rd time buying it? I understand you keep getting taken off the store. But at least give us that paid in the past free access. The last version stopped working entirely, even tho I had it installed when it was taken off. Now I have 2 versions on the same phone lol. It's cheap, but still, it isn't fair to us loyal to you."

      "Ok, so I needed to store my documents on an SD card, therefore I had to purchase the premium version. $7.99AUD, not a lot but when you expect the premium version to be better than the normal free one and it's worse, per sé, useless, I get a wee bit ticked off. The dozen or so documents I had scanned on the free version have disappeared without a trace. I'm hoping for a refund but the money has probably disappeared too. DON'T BUY IT.",
      "The app worked great for a while and then became faulty after use of more than a month. The issues: the app would switch off at random points. The screen would go black. Now it is not uploading the JPEGs I am taking to my Onedrive. It just says Simple Scanner Pro is running. I would suggest using an app that is a bit more reliable as taking photos is essential for my work as an archivist and I spend just as much time trying to get the app to work as I do researching and documenting!",
      "Nice easy app to use that does what it says it should. It has been very useful both personally and professionally. Just one thing to say about the current version, the way in which you're able to adjust the scan area after you take a photograph is better than previously as it is more accurate but the older and slightly less accurate way was a lot quicker. I think mostly that quicker is better than more accurate. Could we have the option to use either? Maybe we already do and I didn't notice.",
      "Clean and easy to use, does all what one expects it to do. Automatic detection of the document border in the picture is slighty off, by only a few pixels, but that is only a minor annoyance. Will never look back to camscanner, ever.",
      "App is easy enough to use. But I paid to upgrade to pro in order to fax. Now I have to pay more money for coins to fax. Doesn't make much sense to me...."

      "After having tried multiple file explorers, I finally settled for this one. It's intuitive to use, has multiple features like accessing a Windows network (which I needed), accessing cloud storage like Google Drive (which can be used to show you the number of files and space used by a folder, something that Google's own Drive app can't show), access the files in your phone by type of media (photos, audio, etc.), etc. All of this while looking good. Would love an update though. Recommended.",
      "Unable to transfer to external network storage. Support is basically non-existent --so you're on your own! Samsung Galaxy Note 8 & 9. I took my time writing to ask if there was a way to circumvent this problem and I never heard back from them... Probably never will. I can do this with all other operating systems. The circle spins \"Can read from sources\" I love the app. I actually preferred it to the Android because it's more intuitive. However, not responding to your customers is not acceptable",
      "Bought this, the advertised features didn't work. Cloud storage worked, but fx connect and network file transfer simply do not. Fx connect causes whichever phone receives the initial connection request to crash the phone. Full reboot. Every time. Network file transfer simply refuses any connections despite repeated attempts and devices used. Lame. Don't recommend.",
      "Instantly wanted to purchase but waited to test more. Be sure to try the trial. This developer makes some great apps. Always room for improvement but it's definitely on par with the best. I'm coming from ES Pro, so I'm missing some of my old features, but this brings things to the table I didn't have before. I really miss my swiping between windows the most (the current isn't as fluid/natural)...",
      "I've been using this for a long time, and have generally liked it a lot. However, recently I tried using the FX Connect feature, and it would not work correctly, although it worked in the past. I sent a support email, with no answer after a week or so, so I resent the same email, as a forward, so they'd know I already sent it once. Still no reply after another week or two, so until I get a reply, I will rate them at one star. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect some response to a bug report. Sorry FX"

      "WHile it willlet me move an open window to a second monitor - not seeing a way to use two screens extended on a RDP session, or start a second RDP session? So 3 stars on",
      "Good on Apple, but on this tablet i was given i cant even get the thing to click. This version needs fixing.",
      "For my purposes, the Android edition of this app (is) inferior to the iOS edition, for a very specific reason:  It DOES NOT wake up my PC.  I like the app so much, I was even willing to purchase it a second time- this time, in the Android side of the world.....for those times when I'm remote and my Ipad doesn't have a network connection.  But now I see, that I'm still going to be stranded unless I get my Ipad onto a network... to issue the wake-up call to my sleeping PC.  If/when the developer fixes this deficiency, I'll update this review, but for the moment, I cannot endorse the Android app as strongly as its iOS counterpart.  Update:  The developer has assured me; a major update to the Android app is underway, that will address this shortcoming.  (I neglected to mention- the developer [is] responsive.  I've made about 4 posts, and all were answered within 24-hours)",
      "Installed it on my S9+ few months ago, don't recall using it on this phone. Noticed that I am running out of space on phone storage and decided to find what is using it. Imagine my surprise when I found Jump ate 20GB !!! Had to clean up application cache via OS to reclame back the space consumed by app that shouldn't be even running if not used. There is not a single host added to it either.",
      "I really like this app a lot. I have it installed on all my macs/windows desktops because I prefer to have a single POE for all my computers. This way I don't have to carry multiple laptops everywhere. The only thing I have a problem with is running it on my Chromebook. I don't have the option to map my ctrl key to the cmd key when remoted in and the screen doesn't seem to scale correctly. I'm hoping for an update to resolve the chromebook issues since there isn't a specific chorme OS version."

Because: - Doesn't have middle handles for crop quadrangle. - Auto crop is terrible and unusable. - Rotate icon show rotation to the left while it actually rotates right. - Loud sound by default - I don't even want to dig settings to find how to turn it off (if it even possible). - It's enough, deleted it. Dev, take care of your app or delete from here: it is a trash even amid free apps",
      "Worth every penny, does great quality scans with lots of filters, as well as so many options like re-scanning a scan - awesome! And I was thrilled to find that the text recognition is really very good! 💗 Just one thing I'd like to suggest - My Pictures folder now has over 150 folders, each containing single scans! A separate folder for them elsewhere, like in DCIM perhaps, would be so much more ideal, and I would really like to have My Pictures folder back! 🙏🏻 Thank you! 💗",

I'm scanning documents and contracts and need clear text, but no matter what I did it was blurry. Kind of annoying considering it's the most expensive scanner to PDF app. Should probably have better quality if you want to be the most expensive.",

      "Bit of a pain having to use adb to set device admin as most users would probably struggle with this. Whilst I could disable 50 bloatware apps, there are a ton more on my S10 5g and I could not import a custom xml (in device root folder) for my device which safely disables 100 bloatware apps/processes. Also, is there any way I can remove \"this device is managed by your organisation\" from the lockscreen.",
      "Take it down from the store, it no longer works. I found out after buying it today 3/22/2020. Verizon Galaxy Note 10. I guess I'm stuck using adb to disable stuff",
      "The app works great but am sick of paying for it every time I reset my phone. I am able to leave/edit a review which proves I have purchased it but there is no download button just another buy button!!!!! Sort this out. You ignore my email requests.",
      "Impressed and very happy. Does exactly what it says. You of course have to give it privileges to do what you are downloading it to do. Just to let others know this app does not do anything to your phone that you don't tell it to do. Ugh thanks for this one!",
      "If you don't consider yourself at least somewhat computer savvy, skip this APP all together. The process to enable Owner permissions can be super frustrating. Once you get through the installation process, the APP does exactly what it says it will. Following the instructions on the website for enabling Owner permissions alone will probably not work. You need to understand how to change your environment variables on your PC to get device communication working. Once you have comms, the instructions work perfectly. If you decide to try this APP, have some time to kill for troubleshooting."

      "Pretty great overall, simple, effective and with some nice features like a built in generator. The only suggestion (and it is a very important suggestion) is having a lock to view the private keys!!! The lock on decryption is great but uslless if you can just view and instantly copy the private key. Another option is just having a lock on the whole app before use. Other than that it's been great. Ps. I can confirm that this app has sent and received 0kb of data so I feel pretty safe using it.",
      "Does exactly what I need it to. The UI is very simple - highly recommend it for those new to PGP. This is more effective for quick encryption/decryption than Kleopatra, my preferred PC PGP app. Importing keys is easy. Managing keys is easy. Overall it just worked alot better than I thought it would. Best $1 I've spent in a while. It's better than every free app I tried.",
      "App works perfectly. If you're having problems decoding/encrypting you're probably doing something wrong",
      "this app is described as simple and intuitive. i have found it to be neither, and I'm not a beginner, i have used pgp encryption before. there is no decryption launch it seems you have to copy and paste encrypted text first then encrypt it only then do you get an option to decrypt and i don't even know if it encrypted the encrypted text that i wanted to decrypt in the first place. then there is the pass word in the app the word \"will\" isn't even spelled correctly. it's not very professional",

Now, with the advent of an editable \ncover page, they have made a solid app that's easy for ANYone to use! \nThanks FaxFile✌🏼😁✌🏼 P.S. Please contact me - it would be nice to be able \nto get rid of the old, integrated fax cover sheet, because now that I've \npurchased the FaxFile Cover, recipients receive two covers; one generic, \nand one personalized. Plus, each fax costs an extra 10 credits because the \nolder version of FaxFile has one integrated.",

And you can email a PDF of these drawings right from BuildCalc so you can print them or share them. \r\n• Fence Function: Give BuildCalc a fence row length and it will tell you how many posts, rails, pickets, and or panels you need. \r\n• Interactive Functions: The Stair, Baluster, Compound Miter, Diagonal and Hip/Valley functions are now fully interactive. Want to change input values? Change the Run? Switch between Regular and Irregular Hip Roof analysis? You can do this and your results will be updated automatically - without you needing to remember what key to press. \r\n• New Full Daylight Visibility Mode\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE ANSWERS: \r\n\r\n• You are no longer tied down to: only one brick, block or tile size for the masonry function; a fixed number of drywall sheet sizes; only one footer cross sectional area; or one size of shingles and sheathing. If you don’t see the size you want, you can add as many as you need. And for area input, you can store your custom sizes in Length x Width format, so you won’t have to do mental gymnastics to figure out what was the dimensions for that last size you stored. \r\n• Want to cut your hip roof rafter using a miter saw ... or a circular saw using a hand-held protractor? With a tap of a button, BuildCalc will automatically switch between Miter Saw and Protractor results. BuildCalc can do this for Compound Miters, too. \r\n• Sheathing Angles, Purlin Angles, Gable Area, Backing Angles, Plan Angles, Rough vs. Finished Stair Layout Dimensions, Stringer Throat, Stringer installation dimensions ... and a lot more not found on other construction calculators. \r\n\r\n\r\nLESS COMPLEXITY AND LESS HASSLE: \r\n\r\n• Tired of having to press and press and press buttons to get the results of a calculation? BuildCalc puts an end to this. For all advanced functions, you get ALL of your results in list form with just one or two key taps. \r\n• And, rather than having to write down those results, all advanced functions allow you to save your results  so you can recall the complete results at your convenience. \r\n• Less “quirks”. Have you been annoyed by arcane key stroke sequences on other construction calculators? We are too. BuildCalc streamlined the keystrokes to do a better job of giving you less “errors” and more results. Don’t remember what you have to enter before a Hip Rafter or Stair calculation? Well, now you don’t have to. BuildCalc will provide you with a check list of inputs and on-the-spot help to get it right. \r\n• Drywall and Masonry “Room Mode”: If you have stored a Length, Width and Height for a room, BuildCalc will give you the Drywall or Masonry required for the walls and the ceiling / floor - with only a tap of the Drywall or Masonry button.

      "Was great now is garbage. Seems to be totally unsupported and neglected. For example, they still appear to support manual transcriptions. I have requests dating back to last June (NINE MONTHS!!!!!!!) That are still pending. Nine months??? Is anyone doing anything to support this?? This would not be an issue if OCR worked. Even black sans serif fonts on a white background seem too difficult for them. Here is a recent address according to their OCR: 6ulaauI6ua sajes 'IQ JO[uas",
      "Was a great app for many many years, now it's junk. Features removed, over promise, under deliver, premium is a waste - look elsewhere. 1st, Gmail signature block parsing into new contacts had been broken since 31Jan with no resolution. 2nd, text copy buffer into contacts has been removed since 7Feb with no resolution. 3rd, Backup & Export existing contacts remains broken with no resolution. Support's responsive to tell you time has passed, but not doing anything to resolve.",

      "This app has been very helpful in the past when I paid for the Pro version. But for the last year, I have to spend extra time closing out these ads for the other products/upgrades/etc that are offered. Finally get past this just to get reminded about Font packs that don't exist or whatever. Tap \"don't ask again\" for the hundredth time, and finally I can look at my documents. Time to start searching for another app.",
      "it's the only app I use to edit all documents, but it often lags when typing & has a few oddities like won't delete when using SwiftKey keyboard. The best thing is that it converts any Microsoft doc to pdf & also allows pdf editing. it's also one of few apps that converts apple's .pages docs into Word .docx for when my clients only have Apple (annoying) products",
      "Please enter 2020 by using smart quotes! I like this app but my docs are riddled with supposed misspelled. Spellcheck is useless because of this. Otherwise there would be seamless integration with documents form other apps. I'd give 5 stars because of features and NOT forcing me to use a proprietary cloud service. Instead, I'm always looking for an alternative. What's the hold up?",
      "If I wanted ads, I would have picked the \"free\" version. Keeps pestering the user with promotions of even cooler product options. Not once, not twice but nearly every second run. Sure, you want to endorse the \"premium\" version, but there should be a setting to hide these ads for optional components or ban them to some submenu. The menu is also cluttered with promotional items at the top. In terms of the advertised functionality the app does what it claims it does.",
      "Used to love it...I purchased this app because I was impressed with it. I have used Documents 2 Go forever and found that I liked this more. They did regular updates and it works. My irritation and reasoning behind a one star is that I get annoyed with a popup to purchase their Premium package that is an additional $20/yr. I get it, you need to make more money. Fine, BUT don't annoy customers who paid for the app with constant popups to pay more money! BAD BAD marketing decision."

      "Wow.... Almost any card needs alot of adjustment. There is no intelligence eat all. Like matching first name and first name in mail address or that usually streets send with the word street and not s1reet. (German edition) and there is no matching with any kind of dictionary. The scanning process is full of bugs. I am very disappointed. It would have been a great app 5 years ago. But it needs alot of improvement 😳",
      "I was a happy user for MANY YEARS. However, this app has taken such a TERRIBLE CHANGE. TOTALLY UNSATISFIED NOW with the state of the paid app, since they now want a monthly subscription for most of the features we had with the paid version. Now MOST OF THESE IMPORTANT FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS HAVE DISAPPEARED, and only available with the MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION VERSION. I feel totally BETRAYED BY CC for this move. Can't find enough words to describe how badly CC sucks now. Look at the plethora of 1 star reviews recently on APPGROOVES for this program now to see what I am talking about in more depth. In all my years since the beginning of Android apps, I think that what CC has done in their change is by FAR, THE BIGGEST CASE OF BETRAYAL TO THE CUSTOMER BASE in a move to $UCK MONEY FROM OUR POCKET$$$. If they had started with MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION like this in the beginning, and we knowingly bought into this, then I have no grounds for my BEEF. But to have a HUGE USER BASE, tied into the CC ecosystem, and then to switch to this business model, WITHOUT LEAVING US WITH OUR PREVIOUS FUNCTIONALITY IS THE WORST HIJACK HACK FROM A COMPANY THAT USED TO BE A GREAT APP. HEY DEVELOPER, how about giving your old customers the option for a refund of our paid app IF WE DON'T LIKE THE SWITCH TO SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. Unlike Microsoft that switched office to a paid subscription, at least MS left their old programs that were PURCHASED, still TOTALLY FUNCTIONAL. NOT THE CASE WITH CC. Can UNSATISFIED USERS HERE recommend what you have replaced CC with??",
      "Finally I have no lost business cards and all contacts at hand, shared with all my company executives. Definitely recommend. But don't forget that the provider of this app has history related to viruses. Well I have no extremely sensitive data, but some of you might.",
      "I would say this has a 95% failure rate at actually putting in the right information. I always have to check it then fix it.",
      "Awesome app, just not so lekker that i dont have my premium subscription anymore. Not sure what happened to it"

I noticed it is on your RoadMap, I was just wondering when it might be implemented?",
      "Paired with a VPN client this app allows basic view & edit capabilities in active directory.  I wouldn't want to try much more than account unlocks and password resets, but it handles those actions well and has a handy feature to let you get straight to locked accounts.  A few pounds to avoid having to find a computer to do a password reset seems fair to me.",
      "The user search function just doesn't work. I like this app cause I can browse AD through the tree just fine. I can remote to computers with the junction-ed RDP app. I can unlock and lock loaned laptops. I can go to an office and reset a users password for them, BUT only if I can find them. If they are a new hire, there is no guarantee that they were placed in the correct AD container. So I have to go back to my desk and find them. This isn't too much of a hassle for new employees. But, when I'm helping a classroom of 100 new students, most of whom can't log in because they didn't read their email, it becomes a problem."

Whenever you add objects that are close to the tool drawer icon, you lose the ability to select the object or text close to it if you choose to edit it. also, I am using this app on my Samsung Note 2. Since the app opens only in landscape mode it is very difficult to create beyond the bottom of the screen to create vertically.",
      "This app cost far to much to do far too little. The options provided to create a logo are only compatible with web based are exclusively digital use logo creations. If your attempting to make a legitimate business logo you'll find this app to be a complete waste of time and money for the purpose. The best description I can give, is I feel this app would be better suited for children trying to create a fun logo for school projects. In short its not serious. Don't download it!",
      "This app is close but needs a lot.  First it is way too cartoony, so if you are wanting to make a professional looking logo then you are limited.   It also lack a line or circle draw tool.   Fonts are limited too.   The worst part is if you move a block of text to the very bottom it will get stuck and you have to start all over."

Have to do a little editing most the time upon export but that is minimal. Also needs a search feature for type of business to find contacts based on keyword. I just use the prefix or postfux in the name optiins and put info like \"food vendor\" etc. Then will pull up all food vendors when I search for \"food\" Etc.",

    "description":"SA Group Text is the most efficient way to send group messages. You can add recipient names and phone numbers in an Excel file. You can enter static or personalized text messages right in the Excel spreadsheet. For example, if you enter “Hi {first name}, ...” in a message, the app will take the first name of the recipients and personalize the message, generating text such as “Hi David, …” , “Hi Michael, …”…\r\n\r\nSA Group Text is also an easy way to send text messages to the contacts on your Phone. Just pick groups or individual contacts, type in a static or personalized message and send it.\r\n\r\nWith SA Group Text you can :\r\n★ Import group Text from an Excel file via USB/Email.\r\n★ Create your own groups in an Excel spreadsheet and send messages to them.\r\n★ Insert tags ({nickname},{firstname},{lastname},{nickname},{company} etc) in your text message in order to create personalized messages. When you use this function, each message has a personal touch. For example:\r\n    Dear {firstname}, Welcome to our dinner party.\r\n★ Use any Excel-compatible applications to create your group text messages. Be sure to save as an Excel 97-2003 Workbook.\r\n★ Send SMS to as many recipients as you need within your Excel file \r\n★ Create a formatted Excel file easily. The file can contain only two columns : Mobile and Message. You can find more example spreadsheets on the app’s website.\r\n★ Create flexible group SMS in your spreadsheet. \r\nFor example “{family} Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little {kidname}!”  becomes “David Family – Practice Tomorrow at 5pm for little Johnny!”. The names change over and over again.\r\n★ Schedule your messages you want to send at a specific time. \r\n★ Set the time range of when you want your text message to send.\r\n★ Support for Dual SIM devices (Android 5.1 or later).\r\n★ Pause and resume schedules.  You have to long press the schedule to access pause/resume option.\r\n★ Import and send more 10,000 personalized messages in one time.\r\n★ Send unsent messages. If the app is terminated while sending group sms, the app can continue the sending schedule after you launch the app.\r\n★ Make send report and reply report.\r\n★ The lite version allow you to send 120 messages each time, The full version has no limit. \r\n★ If you provide the recipient's email address in the excel file , the same message will be sent to their email address. \r\nIn order to send messages via email, you have to\r\na. Enable send mail in the app’s setting page.\r\nb. set up an email account to send messages from it.\r\nc. add “Subject” and “EmailAddress” in the excel file. you can see the file sample-mail.xls in the app for detail.\r\n\r\nDue to Android's SMS limitation, each app can only send 100 messages within an hour. You need to install SA Group text plug-in to extend the SMS limitation.\r\nAfter download plug-ins, please go to your phone’s settings, then go to app manager, grant Send SMS permission to these plug-ins.\r\nIf the app runs on Android 8.0 and above, please enable the app running in background manually.

Along with that, the ability to search for nearby veterinarian services is a great addition. The app was also fast and stable with no crashes, which is sometimes a rarity on the app store. If you're interested in learning about your dog's pedigree and connecting with other dog owners, this is a good way to go about it.",
      "This app is great! It found the breed for my new puppy Jack and I was amazed to see how accurate it was. The fact that you can find out even more about the breed by going to Wikipedia is really cool too. The best part, I'm new to the area and it helped me find a new vet close by my house. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who has a mixed breed dog!",
      "I love this app! I have done rescue for years and I wish I would have had this a LONG time ago! It's like a DNA test without the price tag. I was able to do my dogs and all of my fosters and the results rock! I love that they promote rescues and shelters too. What great way to help get animals adopted. I highly recommend this app!",
      "I love this! So many fun things to do besides just finding my dog breed. I really loved the larest blog about how to have fun and keep my pup entertained while self quarantined. Best purchase in long time.",

While I'm not in the market for a new dog (yet), I love being able to share pictures of my pup with other dog lovers in this online community. And when i do want to adopt another dog, i know just where to look and do my research."

      "It was installed on my tablet and scan quality for text was unreadable on scans. Also the scan appears as if this is created for cell phones as the scan area was only part of my screen. I tried this product because all other scanners I reviewed collect information on what you do, this claims they take no private information from program usage and scans. Privacy is a huge concern on the android platform. It looks like a .jpg is taken and then converted to pdf. Original snapshot looks better.",

      "This tool is fantastic. I've known the folks behind this app for years and have used their custom niche market calculators before anyone even heard of the internet, let alone a Smartphone. Check out their website and see all of the time saving productivity tools that they sell at very competitive prices.",
      "If you are a Real Estate Agent, you've probably bought the physical calculator. I was a bit skeptical when I downloaded the app. Until I ran it. What a pleasant surprise...the thing just works...no issues. There ain't no way I'll forget to take it with me, because like everyone else, my phone is glued to my body. Qualifier Plus...can't leave home without it! Terrific. Oh, oh! Also get their \"ConversionCalc Plus\", what a little gem that is.",
      "I am a frequent user of this particular calculator, the Qualifier Plus IIIx #3415. Calculated Industries errantly changed the button layout for the app version. They created the app layout created with a CLEAR button. In doing so, however, they removed the BACK button which is integral to all of our frequent calculations. Any entry that only requires a step Back now requires a Clear, which is extremely undesirable. If I see an update with the proper layout, I'll be happy to update this review.",
      "I like this app! It has tons of features that a user can do; one such scenario would be buying a house, a vehicle, etc.. it has everything that a user would want to find out, such as fees, taxes, amortization schedule(s), and so on. It's such an indispensable tool that everyone should have!!! :)",
      "I use this multiple times a day. Absolutely could not imagine my business without it. Thank you!"

Прежде чем купить, я перепробовал очень много альтернатив. Тут шлюз есть, настроил ретину средствами приложения (до этого держал отдельное приложение для изменения разрешения), перфоманс отстроил так, что RDP откликается ооочень быстро, софт предоставляет кучу настроек, до сих пор много чего изучаю. Но Я конечно сам дурак и не почитав даже описания на радостях купил это приложение. Я не могу понять зачем оно мне даже бесплатно нужно. Это просто читалка документов, которая редиректит на другие приложения. А другие приложении само собой не поддерживают ваш шлюз и разумеется мои терминалы, что работают через шлюз, через эту программу не работают. Так что спасибо команде разработчиков десктопного стека, а это приложение пока что еще ничего не стоит и я не вижу что тут вообще оценивать...",

      "Was a fine app but now it won't maintain a persistent connection with the server so if your organization requires verification you will have to reverify several times a day and you won't get notifications or calendar updates. Customer support has ignored my request for help and won't even respond to acknowledge the receipt of my email. I'm looking for a replacement app",
      "Was working fine but now I have to manually login Everytime with the same auto login credentials. This negates the calendar sync feature I relied on. Please fix",
      "The App is now unusable... for Samsung s10 phone and S5e Tablet. The app keeps needing to REFRESH to even view anything. Also, can not send an email at all... 'send' goes directly to LOGON screen. Great for years...now..? What happened ?",
      "I was having an issue where I wasn't getting the Outlook 365 popup to be remembered. I cleared everything in Chrome, reinstalled, etc... but it just wouldn't come up. I just got a new phone and, of course, the pop up was there and so I am happy now but I am afraid I will see the issue again. It would be good to know how to reset the browser or settings if needed. Other than that, this app is great if your company requires OWA. Clean interface, good functionality, very few bugs.",
      "Makes my life easier! Use this to coordinate with work colleagues without dragging out the company laptop. Ties right into to our OWA system and gives me all the features from my laptop Outlook App right on my Android phone and Tablet."
