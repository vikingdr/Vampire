      "The app is alright. When the presenter's connection is terrible we are never able to see the screen and such. However, if their connection is good, then the quality is actually not bad. Although, I would like the creators to add a “(s/b) is typing...” bubble when someone is typing. This will prevent any unnecessary anger grunts from our teachers when the class is not answering their questions, even when someone is typing as fast as possible.",
      "Has worked flawlessly for me for quite a while. Lately, sound quality is even decent on low bandwidth connections. Audio can be difficult to understand if presenters use cheap phone microphones and stand far away, but you can't blame the service for that.",
      "App is great, but the output volume is too loud on earphones even when my phone volume is set to it's minimum. I have to take my earphones out and set them near my ear to have the app not screech into my eardrums. An option to adjust output volume in-app would be really useful.",
      "Chaotic, laggy, plain unorganized. Do not get this. I was excited the first time I saw this app, now I know I'm being led to dread whenever I see it. Its just crazy to the limits. That morning I had art class, I couldn't hear anything and even when I could it was bad quality. I had to sit there for about four hours listening to the disturbing sounds of people shouting and voices lagging. If you ask me, that was a one star experience.If you think this app is good by the outside think again.",
      "I don't even understand how Google's own app doesn't work on Android. Every time I try to join a Hangouts meetup, I get an error message and cannot join. Re-installed and re-started phone to no avail. This app deserves negative stars. OnePlus 7 Pro"

When I finally found someone who's willing to enter their info on the site, they were supposed to get an email asking for in person verification of my passport, but didn't get it.",
      "Just a waste of time as the App is totally glitchy and won't allow you to book even if position/gig available. Called several times to correct/inquire the issue but no help and basically told to delete it if it didn't suit me also asked on several calls if it was personal and if I was welcomed never a straight answer and after reading the other reviews I see it's not just me and I ask why not update the app with fixes.... bad customer service!!!",

I called and the told me I was denied.",

      "I am sooo glad I found this app!!! It is super easy to use. It automatically opens up to allow you to get right to scanning. I love that you can clean up the image, like fill in a corner that has a piece of the background or erase creases. I had been putting images on a document and then saving it as a PDF, but the quality was not good, as I am sure you can imagine. I can now send professional scans. Thank you Adobe Scan!",
      "Alright I take it back, they implemented a great share system similar to the Acrobat Reader app. My last preview is below. Congrats to the developers whole improved it, I hope I helped. Previous: [ Great scanning aweful sharing. 3 stars just because it has been like this a quite a while and it is pretty bad. ]",
      "This App falls into 2nd place after CamScanner, which I've been using for several years.. This App does Everything that CamScanner does, and is (Free), the scan quality is as good as CamScanner. To get the same features in CamScanner you've got to get the paid version.. If I would of come across this App before CamScanner, I wouldn't have paid for CamScanner..",
      "So far, so good. This is my second time using this and it's so helpful. I no longer have to find a scanner, connect to internet, scan in my files to my email, and make sure all is good. This app captures exactly what I'm needing.",
      "This is a very good app, but I have rated it the least because it does not have an option to disable automatic uploads to the cloud, or to disable uploads at all. I will eventually uninstall the app once I find an alternative app that won't upload my files to the cloud."

      "This app definitely gets the job done. May not be all flashy but it does exactly what I need it to do. I have yet to run into any issues. The most frustrating thing about it is probably having trouble capturing the image. Most of the time it's no problem, but every now and then it will take forever to get a quality scan. Overall, 4 stars. Worth it.",
      "This is a MUST HAVE app for both personal and for business that everyone should have. I LOVE IT. As a Realtor I no longer need to run back to the office to scan docs in order to send them to my clients. I am able to scan immediately where ever we are signing and clients really like and appreciate this type of service. This app has lots of great features. Thank you so much to the person or people that created this app that has made such a difference for my business.",
      "Whew! I \"think\" my search is over. Lot's of free useful setup features and lots of one time, under 5 buck, purchases. So far, it's underrated! Try it, then buy the extra features. You can live without them, but why, when the total package is so affordable.",
      "Amazing, useful, it is a game changer! I used this app for YEARS and I absolutely love it. Especially when you don't have an actual scanner. This app really makes your work look like a PDF document. BEST APP EVER! I recommended this app so MANY people, including family and they love it too! Honestly, it's even easier to use than an actual scanner and fax machine!",
      "Excellent App. Turns paperwork into a pdf, gave me a choice of emails, drives, dropbox, and more. Makes going to Staples for scanning pdf's a chore of the past. Just takes a moment to pick up and auto center documents. I love it! Way to go! The perfect modern use of technology."

I moved time zones and I have followed all the instructions given to fix the problem I changed it in settings, changed it in customers profile and even uninstalled and reinstalled.

After once getting it to work w/ a video conference, I deleted a user & then tried to add him back but couldn't; the user activation emails did not work. I'm willing to try again in the future, once they get the problems worked out. Oh, & it should install once for ALL users on a PC. I've recommended to the county emergency mgmt team I work with, to use Zoom for the time being.",
      "I love being able to be connected to work for emergencies. I can set my status and it syncs up to my calendar no problem. My company uses multiple platforms for communication. But I do think switching everyone to Microsoft teams would be very beneficial. I have not tested much of the group video conferencing. One feature that I do really like is that you can give someone access to your computer through teams to fix quick problems or collaborate.",
      "With the COVID-19 outbreak, my office had to scramble to figure out how to work from home. Our IT Manager kept saying we we underutilizing this program and he was right! You can use it on multiple platforms - computer, tablet, phone. Awesome chat feature - so it streamlines conversations, use instead of text or email. Share and edit files with your partners, you can edit the same document together. Use Planner to assign tasks. Link a notebook people can share their research, project ideas.",
      "I love Teams in theory. It's way easier than other systems to pull your documentation, meetings and general team collaboration together. However, the biggest issue is not being able to have multiple windows or tabs which means you lose all context if you need to quickly shift from a chat to a doc or have both open at the same time. Also, the complete lack of integration with Adobe around pdf documents means you need to download pdf docs every time as opposed to opening them natively.",
      "I love Teams. I haven't mastered it yet, and I know there is so much more that can make me more productive at work, but it's easy to use, and making the transition from IBM Sometime and Lotus Notes to Teams has been an easy process. I really like how quickly it synced up with my Office 365 account on my work computer, laptop, and my phone. It keeps me in the knownwith my staff and my colleagues, and allows me to share progress on various projects quickly and easily."

      "Last time I used this app I remember it being great, this time (several months later) I am greeted basically no functionality in the app unless you upgrade to the pro version or pay an in app purchase. Basically this app is no longer free from what it seems. It's also littered with ads, including ones that randomly pop up and fill the whole screen. Unfortunate.",
      "Well, I'm waiting for the pop-up adds and upsell, but so far, they haven't come. I use this kind of app for many things. I find it quite convenient and much nicer that many comparable apps. The app I used to use has become loaded with bloatware, pop-ups and it takes way too long to get anything done. This app far exceeds them. I highly recommend Simple Scan and will do so with word-of-mouth as well.",
      "So far for my work requirements from the app. It does really well and recalls old documents as well in case. Keeps each time I access separate which I need. No need to clean sheet it. It does it on its own for me. I just keep taking pictures and it stores, sends as I need. Simple, effective, cool.",
      "App is simple. Too many intrusive ads. Ads will pop out and make it difficult to look at or do anything. Instead of locking up more advanced features to paying customers, the developer appears to have decided to serve ads almost to the point that free version is unusable. It would be nice if the developer could keep the basic part of the app without ads popping out.",
      "Does exactly what it says. Plus it's still free unlike majority of all the other similar apps that started of free but now want to charge for the same service. So would rather use this app which does exactly the same as them but for free. Hopefully this won't start charging once it gets a loyal customer base."

Sometimes the call gets stuck. 2. In case we are logged in to both mobile and machine, some messages get lost in transmission or half of msgs get delivered at either locations. It is not consistent. Overall a good app to have in situations.",
      "So far it is good if you often have to talk to your colleagues when away from your desk. The problems I have are: 1. If you have a continuous discussion when in and out of the office, you cannot see your exchange on the desktop when on your mobile, and vice versa. 2. The quality of your call varies: not so good when on mobile internet, but really good when over a stable broadband. A couple of times a crucial call from our executive was so broken up, I had to ask his EA to call me on mobile.",

I am getting the error \"Someone is presenting content using a sharing or recording feature that your version of the app doesn't support right now.\" I sent an e-mail to the developer e-mail address indicated but it bounced back. Can you please assist? Thank you.",

That's a huge deal breaker considering it's suppose to be a secure space and yet no security apps are able to be configured or used within Secure Folder! Ridiculous really. Needs changing ASAP.",
      "Love this app, however it could be greatly improved. The notifications are a bit buggy, and we need more options for notifications. For example, I wish there was an option for it to not show notifications at all unless the secure folder was on, and whenever I turned it off the notifications would be removed from the screen and be shown as soon as a turn the folder back on.

Because if I needed to add something to my personal calendar I can make sure it doesnt conflict with my work, while keeping everything segregated",

      "I have had this app since DTE first came out with it. When they started charging a fee for it, I decided it was worth the fee. It has been working great but all of a sudden it crashes everytime I try to open it. I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it but it will not allow me to log in. Then I got an email from DTE Energy saying too many failed logins had locked down my account and wanted me to reset my password, which I did. But still will not let the app open up.",
      "Insight finally contacted me back on 2 diff occasions to follow up (mos apart & w/no prior knowledge anyone had). I keep using the app bc the energy reading are helpful but the gas still has missing days &/or data for days at a time, but it's better than it was. There's literally no point in contacting service. They have no clue what's going on w/the app or how to fix it besides clearing cache, force stop, reinstall. That fails, youre on your own, but they tell you the buy bridge. No thank you.",
      "Cool app. I'm huge on saving energy so this really helps me see that and allows me to manage my usage. I also always forget to turn something off before I leave my place, so it's nice to check the app and see what I've left on, and with my smart bulbs and switches/outlets I can turn it off from my app at work. I also sometimes forget to unplug my straightener so that's another thing I can turn off once I've already left home. This app has probably prevented my house from catching on fire.",
      "Wouldn't connect to my insight bridge until 11/12 app update. I spent 2+ hours with the DTE tech at my house (+ even more time with the phone support people). 11/15 update: Now I have intermittent data, but connection drops from time to time - it will go out for several hours per day. App lacks features, like being able to see peak v off peak use for a given day. It would be nice if the circle had different color background for peak, and if app showed total daily KWh, peak KWh, & off peak KWh.",
      "Worked fine until 3 weeks ago. App is unstable and gives usage only in hours now instead of minutes. Today's usage only shows usage now and not before. Reinstalled app and all is good now."

      "When we first signed up with Nextiva the app was in early stages but since then they’ve made lots of great updates and I really like it now. I can switch between functions easily and I have all my contacts loaded in for easy calling and texting. It’s a great design and when they do make changes and updates they make it easy to learn and adapt to the changes. Really happy with it overall.",
      "I can run all my calls through this app and it’s easier than switching to my desk phone. All calls and texts are tracked into our CRM for the service team if records are needed. The systems are synced together and working really well for our business. I am really impressed with the design and functionality.",
      "The update was horrible. I hate the IM screen being the main screen. I wish the phone dial pad was like before. The app glitches allot. Just seems like a cheap product. My business model does not allow me to get something different or believe me I would! I causes more problems than it's worth.",
      "Won't Accept User Name/PW. I have to work from home now and the app won't accept my credentials. I logged in in my phone and work computer just fine, but when I got home and installed it won't let me login on the Desktop or Android versions. My credentials work on the website so it doesn't make sense. Terrible support, emailed yesterday as soon as I noticed but no response.",
      "This app is packed with features for managing a business and handling lots of calls throughout the day. The forwarding options make it easy for me to manage meeting time and ensure I’m not disrupted. I can also send and store text messages against a customer's profile so that we have a record of all communications. It’s secure and fast and overall nicely designed too."

Sometimes it fails to scroll, sometimes it scrolls disproportionately and sometimes it scrolls after a delay.",
      "It's show for updates every time. I don't know what are you changing day by day. Before few months I was running so better than nowadays. I am irritating to use this app. I am making some distance to use this because of updating every day. And after updates while I open the app then it show network issue. Why its happening.?",
      "I appreciate the efforts of developers for constantly upgrading this app but forcing me to update this app every few months that is what irritates me the most. I was very much comfortable with the features and interface that were there a couple of years ago. Because of the annoying push notification of update was what drove me to uninstall this app. Any how am back now only to see many more irritating features. Cant say when would i do the next uninstall maybe for good this time.",
      "The app itself is very useful, but for a long time the scrolling on \"My network\" section has been malfunctioning, lagging and jittering all the time. The \"My network\" scrolling is unresponsive most of the time, which is something that doesn't happen on iOS. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible, as it ruins the experience for Android users.",
      "Few years later and I don't see any development in this app. Yes, the idea is good and this is what makes me still use it but I am so disappointed. Recently I removed some connections because I am no longer interested in their accounts and you know what? Now they are all in the \"suggestions\" section. All I see is the faces of people who I just have removed. Great! In addition I moved to a different company/industry but I mainly see contacts from my previous job/industry."

      "This app is wonderful! Very easy to use, I can track packages that I've ordered, and they make it super-easy to calculate how much something will cost to ship with their awesome shipping calculator. They even give you the option to receive updates via text message whenever your order/package is scanned when going from one post office to another. This app has definitely made my life a little bit easier! I highly recommend it! Thanks 🙂",
      "This WAS a great and useful app until it was updated. I usually had my mail held nearly every month, but I've only successfully had it held one time in the last few months. It's not the post office or carrier...it's the app. I can enter a start date to hold my mail, but when I try to enter an end date (3 or more days' hold), it changes the start date to the date I want it to end. For the \"Hold Mail\" feature, this app is now TOTALLY USELESS.",
      "So easy to use. I tell everyone about it. Update.. Feb 11, 2024.. Still great for seeing what mail/packages r coming. The one thing that's frustrating is even though I select to stay signed in, Iit doesn't n i have hard time remembering username n password..ugh.. Update-3/19/20 can't remem passwords or username n still won't stay logged in",
      "Knowing that you have mail or packages in advance is a plus. So if a piece is not delivered USPS can check on it. I would not have know this without this service. It also helps when you sharecan apartment, which has happen they had a piece of my mail by mistake because they did not check well their mail. Thanks for this service.",
      "I was having problems with my mail after i purchased a P.O. Box it well over a month to get my mail straightened out, to make a long story short I downloaded the USPS mobile app. I love it!! I will receive alerts from the post office when I have mail or a package in my P.O. Box and it will show what it is!! Love this app."

      "As of very recently, the app no longer functions correctly. I cannot press \"apply\" when changing filters for job searches, this issue persisted after clearing cache and data. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and at the login section, when pressing Skip, I am unable to press any of the buttons on the next pop-up confirming that I want to skip login.",
      "Doesn't save my searches or save any jobs. Always freezing or crashing. I can't even upload my resume. I've tried updating from my phone, google drive, and dropbox. For some reason it keeps saying the upload failed and it is not because of the size or format. Every time I attempt to put in the information by typing I just get a blank screen and it freezes up. I can't even see what information/email I used to sign up with so that I can just try and do it on my laptop",
      "The search function does not work right. I would like to search for jobs across the country and the location setting is \"(optional)\"; however, it will not conduct a search unless you put in a location. It becomes very tedious to have to search city by city. This should be corrected. Also, the instructions for closing an account lead to a bunch of dead ends. There are no close account options under the profile settings as noted in the help section.",
      "It has been somewhat easy to use but definitely still needs improvements such as allowing me to file jobs that I have applied for into its own category so that when I get a response from employers, I can go find the relevant job description for reference (the existing \"Applied Jobs\" tab is useless). Jobs by proximity doesn't seem to do much help."

      "The older version was better, in my opinion. You were allowed to sign and tell the driver where to place it, and tracking, for the most part was spot on! Now, with this newer version, it sucks!! Rarely does it update, I've only been able to sign for my package once. SUCKS! Update: 19 July 2019 App seemed to be working alright, for a bit. Now when I try to sign for an order it tells me the package I'm signing for is not in my name...app still SUCKS!",
      "I love this app, but it needs some updates, like for example: to let the person who is wanting to ship the package out how much it actually weighs, and the actual measurements of the length, width, and height of the box that is going to be shipped out like for example: 1.75 inches or 1.5 inches, so that the person who is shipping the package out and the person who is purchasing the item or items inside of the box know how much the actual price the shipping is for any box, big or small or medium.",
      "I really like this app. The only issue I have is that I can't delete old addresses that are no longer needed. It really causes problems when it automatically goes to the old address first. Other than that its a great app and I like it better than the other package delivery app I have. Its easier to use and less confusing.",
      "For the most part the UPS Mobile application works great. For those who use it every day to do their business, I am sure it is a perfect tool. For those of us who only use it once in a while, though, it can be quite cumbersome and tedious. Each time I sign onto the application it has been updated and I must relearn, even update my information. And now I've received an email indicating that I may have bought a service in all my confusion.😳",
      "Very easy to use and understand. I've only used it to track my packages because I like to have an idea of when my packages are arriving and because of porch pirates, and it's been super helpful. It's pretty up to date. I can get my package off my porch within minutes of drop off. Just love this app."

      "Every time I try to log in it says user name or password incorrect. EVERY TIME. I know what it is. I don't need to reset it, because I know what it is. Thought this would be an easy way to track my packages that never show up on time. NEVER. Nevermind the fact that every day they on on a truck to be delivered by 9 PM. Really odd considering customer support says FedEx doesn't deliver past 8 PM. Apparently they don't work on Saturdays either in my area. Hope you go bankrupt incompetent asses.",
      "Awful bugs. Have to type in Username and password almost every time, even if less than two hours have passed. Have enabled the fingerprint option in app, every single time I login, to make this easier. Fingerprint option works for my banking and other apps however it does not matter how many times I enable in this app. If my parents didn't order so many packages that I have to make sure each driver will leave, I would uninstall. But I have to check this one at least daily. Can't count on noti",
      "This app is incredibly helpful, I am registered. But knowing where my packages are and when to expect them is very good idea. Sometimes packages need to be signed for, and sent to my billing address. It's outstanding that I can have it held a a local drop off location.",
      "Quick to update the delivery details. Easy to know when to expect your package. This app let me know second that my package was available for pickup. The FedEx office that had my package had it on a cart for me to get it to my vehicle. Picking it up was very simple with my ID. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who is dealing with FedEx for any reason. Such an easy way to deal with the process of deliveries.",
      "They definitely update you the very second something changes with your package everytime. You just need to set it up to get notifications with your package, then your all set to get updates, you can even set it up to get text messages as well for updates."

      "My experience with this software has been completely unsatisfactory. I should rightly be given a refund. It did not work properly. It crashed, or froze my computer. When I tried to get others to use it as participants in my meetings, it was unsatisfactory for them too. I feel that I was misled by the description of the product on the ezTalks website. Specifically, it does not seem to be supported or provisioned to work satisfactorily within or from lreland. It seems incapable of supporting a meeting with even a very modest number of participants.",
      "This is the worst app.. i downloaded it on my computer and my computer completely crashed down after i got a message from my antivirus to block it.. which i didn't.. andwithin 2 seconds .. computer crashed.. now my computer has been given for repairing.. hope it gets repaired soon..",
      "Nice App. Almost all the features what I expect is there in this app. And voice call conferencing, chat, whiteboard and screen sharing. Basic level but very nice in this class",
      "Had acquired some invaluable knowledge about the eztalk apps. But unfortunately cannot see navigator clearly and sound /voice a bit noisy ( the background). Good job. Keep it up.",
      "I was notified that this app used my camera for 28 minutes when I never even opened the app. I don't even remember installing this app, but must have at some point. Using the camera without the app running?!? Deleted the app right away."

The update includes a fix for compatibility issues some users experienced with Android OS v10. There were several other bugs that were fixed, but they are way too complicated to explain. Just know that Night Owl Connect is now better than ever!",

      "I mainly bought this because it has an app and I can check on things when I'm not home. But the app is horrible. I've been through all the troubleshooting, more than once and nothing. It freezes all the time, have to restart my phone several times just to get it work, I get a motion detection notification and it won't take me to it to show me. I paid a lot of money for this and I'm disabled and can't work, so this is a huge investment for me. I hope this gets fixed really soon.",
      "If I could give negative stars I would. I cannot play back events via the app on either my Android or iPhone on good wifi networks. After 5 attempts to reach someone on live chat support I was told it would be escalated to level 2 support. Never heard from anyone. Contacted support again and told the same thing. No one ever contacted me. Still have the issue and sent 2 more emails. Still no response. I travel for work which is the sole purpose of purchasing this system and it's useless.",
      "I have a DVR 1080P WD Wired Security System with 10 cams. The app is a poor design. You can't control video play back. You have to play from start to end no jumping to middle of video. so if your continuous recording good luck. Poor interface for pulling up calendar of recorded video. Unable to remotely configure DVR. No remote control of PTZ cams. Tech support unwilling to say what features are being developed/improved for the app and when releases are scheduled. I'm disappointed with app.",
      "Honestly , the cameras are great. This app is terrible. Good luck having consistent notifications, they randomly just stop. Also the cameras show up as \"offline\" constantly. So you have to uninstall and reinstall the app because logging in and out doesn't help. This app deserves no stars. Like I said cameras are fantastic, this app is absolute GARBAGE.",
      "Would be great if only you were able to always view the event selected but after sliding the timeline to the event (red line) you wish to view two or three times, if you try to go to yet another event, it will keep sliding back to the last event viewed no matter how hard you try to convince it that you really want to view the new event you are selecting. Also drives me nuts that NOON on the timeline STILL is labeled 12AM instead of 12PM (goes 11AM, 12AM, 1PM}! Devs, fix it already, please!"

So on an overall project, how long it will take me to do each category of task within that project and more accurately predict time and therefore pricing on future projects. I'm a big fan of this app. Thank you for creating it 😊 👍",
      "Took a little bit of time to dig through how it is all parsed together. However the functionality is great with a no frills UI that makes this app all about efficiency, albeit with some flaws of it's own (but in the same vein as the flaws you come to grow fond of in your first car) that could possibly be improved upon. The app itself is representative of it's very purpose to me, and for that I appreciate everything about it.",
      "Straightforward to use and allows tracking of multiple tasks for multiple customers, with or without rates. Very useful tool."

Last time I checked you don't need any of those to participate in a one way presentation type meeting. Permissions should only be asked for when the relevant feature is requested by the user. Example video and mic should only be asked for when the user turns on mic and video manually.",
      "This app is so frustrating. Everytime I scroll up, it jumps back about 2 days worth of feed and have to scroll all the way back down. Sometimes when I open it, it will tell me that I have no active chats, force close or just not work. I have installed the most recent update, so I know it's just the app itself.

This application is so bad, I avoid using it out of fear of it crashing my phone. If I see a notification from this app, I wait to get to my laptop to see who is messaging me. You can do better than this Cisco.",
      "Why is there no toggle for notification banners? I hate having my phone's audio dimmed with a barely audible sound, but with no quick way to preview and/or dismisse the message. Overall it's a pretty good experience, but the app is lacking basic functionality vs the desktop client. I hope to see message editing and separation of favorite channels soon.",
      "1. Even after call is disconnected the notifications bar shows call is in progress. In this case sign out and sign in back to the app is required to remove this false notification info. 2. 50% of the time this app does not create temporary space for the scheduled meetings. Users whose PC not installed with webex meetings gets frustrated."

In school applications in particular, it can open pdf files and the browser can be customized with the school logo and the school name. The app itself has numerous color themes which makes it feel like you own it. I know it's specifically for enterprise use only but the sheer amount of customizability here is unreal. I'm glad I came to find this app and the support person, Richard. Thanks Richard!",
      "Kiosk Browser is fantastic for controlling your devices. Works with Knox and has a multitude of Javascript functions. Great for placing devices in any environment without worry. Support is extremely helpful if you have questions. Online help guides are well documented to point you in the right direction.",
      "We use Kiosk Browser Lockdown at our museum to display detailed information about objects. (website with text and images) We have only positive things to say about this app. We contacted the developer because we struggled with poor wifi signal and we hoped the app supported some sort of offline-caching. We learned that we can actually host the website locally and Kiosk Browser Lockdown will render it perfectly. (This is even better and easier than what we had in mind). Perfect app, perfect support!",

    "comments":[
      "Update has been a mixed bag. Though the scanner is noticeably faster with the update, the scanner placement has to be just right the first time or else I have to re-scan. Also, the \"almost done\" text notification pops up but does not connect to my messaging app. I have also experienced app freezing, particularly during order processing. In fact, overall order processing time in the app could be improved. On a positive note, I am no longer having to re-take receipt pictures with the update.",
      "Since the most recent update, I cannot even open the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail. I continue to get prompts for promo orders though. However, as the pay rate has continued to diminish, it may just be time for me and Shipt to part ways. Not worth the two hours of driving, shopping, and delivering for $11.",
      "Needs improvement. Needs to be easier to substitute items or force add something when the barcode wont scan. Needs to show the price for items as this can help you find the right thing. Needs isle numbers for some stores as the categories system can out two things in the same categories even if they are on different sides of the store. No pay for mileage so you can only accept the limited number of orders nearby. The worst part is support takes 15-30min to get and help. Even on an active order.",
      "They just launched a new version of the application, and with everything digital you have to wonder what they were thinking? Who did they ask for information? Big change, let's give it more color and make it harder on humans eyes. I can't wait to lose more of my eyesight! Why do I have to see my profile picture? The font is smaller! When you created this did you use it as a practical application, or did you think , we want it to look cool! Getting an alert at 50 mph with 60 seconds to claim!",
      "So far the new app updates are working great for me. EXCEPT the issue that I cannot access my delivery history prior to December 2019. Hoping my communications with HQ will get this resolved quickly as it is a necessary tool I use to reconcile for tax prep. I am not the only Shopper with this issue."

After downloading the Mac OS program, I realized it was packaged with a trojan, meaning OpenText, the created of FirstClass as abysmal security. I would not trust having this app on my phone, as God only knows who's compromised it as well, and seeing as it asks for permission to access things on your device, you have no way of knowing who is actually accessing your personal data, and wether they work for OpenText or not.",

Today I got charged with Rs 2550 and it was very shocking for me when I saw this message. I was confused where my money gone and then mistakenly checked my play store subscriptions and found due this app my money got deducted. I sincerely request the team to refund my money. Requesting you again to refund my money. Please....",

This is totally FRAUD. Kindly return back my money am requesting you.",

      "I have used a wide range of websites and apps in my search over the last two months, and one-click was mostly aspirational... until I found ZipRecruiter. The app is ridiculously easy to use, provided you put the effort in to create a solid and accurate profile. One-click really is one-click on 75% of the roles, and the rest have no more than 1-5 filter questions before the application submits. The instant feedback gives you an immediate sense of how likely you are to get an initial screener.",
      "A very helpful service with a user friendly interface. However as a Canadian, the inability to change the salary denomination to Canadian dollars and the distance calculator to kilometers, I can't give this app a perfect rating. For a service that's meant to be used in Canada, it's very clear that no thought was put into altering the experience for an international audience, which harms the usability of the service.",
      "Great concept. Love the \"1-Tap\" option for filling applications. I can not rate this app 5 stars, as I've yet to land a job, on account that I haven't had appropriate interactions with this site to do so. Just know that I will give this app a 5 star rating, when I do land myself a good job!",
      "I'm one of the last old school so it took me a minute to warm up to it but 1 touch application and knowing instantly when a job is posted. 1 piece of advice if possible once you apply to introduce yourself to them so that got a face to go with the app. Day 2: my notifications have been blowing my phone up all day job offers left and right it's crazy. It's a good feeling when you Have a choice in jobs instead of settling one the first 1 THANKS FOR THE HELP",
      "Needs locations listed more clearly. The jump of 10 miles to 25 miles is actually quite a gap where I am. 30 minutes away vs an hour and a half. Wish they had 15 mile difference. I keep nixing stuff for their locations being too far, and yet that's like the only suggestion they ever make is that location that I always say no to"

      "I found this app after it was recommended to me by a co-worker. It allows you to send faxes of photocopies or photos. This app has been so useful, and I’m sure you’ll love it! This is perfect for the infrequent fax user. Take or choose a pic, enter the phone, and off you go. Really nice.",
      "I have to give this app a rating after downloading it today, liking it, and seeing that I had also used it in 2017. What I'm saying is that this has been a reliable app for a few years now, and after trying multiple fax apps, I really appreciate that you can send for free on this app.",
      "Intuitive interface, fast, fluent faxing. I’ve tried many others, and this is the one I decided to actually in-app purchase credits. I love the push notifications when the fax is delivered. Importing files to the app is seamless, as well as “opening in” from another app. Great job devs ????????????????",
      "Love it. Wish I could get a better image receiver says it's hard to make out yet and is a little confusing setup as far as adding additional page. Words don't continue they just repeat on each page. Ended up sending 5 different faxes all at once and a few didn't even go through. So now their going to get bumbard3d with unreadable millions of pages. Only plus is it sent for free",
      "Bought the Basic Plan but which is 100 total pages. I tried to send a 62Page Fax and they said it was too long I have a total of 100 pages want to use less and it doesn't work. Furthermore when I contacted their customer support they did nothing for me. Nowhere in their pricing does it state how many pages can be faxed at a time. Only total of pages which is 100."

Private group chats occasionally disappear from the side bar (mine and my colleagues') which is why I left off one star. But support is very good. Completely stopped working. iPad version never worked, Android worked for a while but now claims it doesn't recognize my log-in credentials despite the fact they work for the browser version. Every time I try to log in it says \"session expired.\"",
      "Initially had issues connecting to the server. This issue was fixed by including the certificate chain in the certificate used by Mattermost. The documentation for how to set this up was woefully inadequate, but this is not a fault of the app.",
      "Unfortunately continuously crashing. No restart of the app nor my phone keeps solving this. Not usable anymore. It brings up a error message right after opening the app and suggests to restart and then report the error from the menu...but this a deadlock Update: With the latest version back to a working state 👍",

At first it kept saying I was on/off line so I had to constantly double check if it clocked me in/out correctly. Now it's blanking on my job postings and showing them hours later. I'm a substitute for kelly services and they've been heavily using this app to monitor our hours for payment services. The only thing saving me is clocking in as unknown and verifyin. I hope it gets fixed.",

      "App is lame. Hate it. Always have to fight with it to get it to work. I work IT helpdesk, but this is just MY experience here. Geolocation has trouble. Network connection has trouble (must be clearly on EITHER cellular OR Wi-Fi or it won't work--always turning off one or the other to punch in/out). Have clocked in late a time or two because it literally took about 5 minutes to get the app to clock me in. Various other random glitches come and go--right now, it won't show me my time off requests.",
      "Worst login experience. Not friendly for the user at all to get signed in. Why can't the user just enter a login and password , and a PIN if you want the extra security. I was so annoyed trying to login I gave it to someone else to login for me... 5 minutes later success! I haven't even tried using the app yet and this is my feedback."

      "I scanned a few documents to try it out. Then it gives you the option to send them through email but when you click send it goes to the motions that the email was sent. It's like they want you to pay the $5 or it takes your documents hostage and won't let you do anything with them. Screw this app, just a waste of time. Why would you pay for an app that you don't know the quality of the scanned documents or if it works at all.",
      "I just have a try and now I've fallen love with it. It is absolutely EXCELLENT! There's a great feature that you can easily modify the gray scale just after taking the photo. I haven't seen other apps can do this such easily. Also, you can use all the core features without purchasing a pro, ads-free! Although you can't save the results to some three-party apps with a free version, but you can simply save it to your phone! Great app! But I will still buy the pro, just wanna support it.",
      "There are lots of options, so there's bound to be one that fits what you need. The UI is simple and ready-to-use, with a very low learning curve. It is a little frustrating to see a few options blocked behind a paywall, but they're really just quality of life functions, and the developers have to earn money somehow. It's just a really good application.",
      "What a huge joke this app, I mean AD is! I downloaded it today, tried it out on a couple papers I need. That was only a few hours ago. I just tried to use it but all I get is a box asking if I want to buy it from within the app, Or if I want to download the pro version. This explains the complaints of paying and then told they don't have pro version. Just a money scam don't pay for pro!",
      "Pro app doesn''t work as advertised. In order to do multiple pages, I had to upgrade to the pro version. When I did, however, both the quality of the scan with the multi-page selection was lower in the ability to actually add a second page didn't seem to be available in the app. So far, I have heard nothing from technical support, so 1 star. I'd rate it more lowly, given that they have essentially taken my money for no good reason, but that's not an option."

The original logo requested was red, white, and blue. I guess that red, white and blue and yellow is the same thing in India. I gave up after about 20 attempts.",
      "Not the Kind of app i will recommend for these reasons: 1. App developer not responsive. 2. Sellers can't withdraw their hard-earned money using the app. 3. Log in process is a mess. 4. Sign up process on the app is a mess. The checkout flow is crazy, it will show incomplete order, your card will be charged.",
      "Outstanding experience! However, there's always room for improvement. For instance, the app functionality should be improve to allow seller to see when files are attached to a custom offer request. Whenever I receive custom offer request, I will have to get to my PC to see if the buyer if the buyer attach any file to the request. Happy 10th anniversary to fiverr! God bless the Fiverr team.",
      "I love this app so much. Im always working, always on the go working 100 to 120 hrs a week sometimes. Its nice to have this app on hand when I need to find an artist or marketer fast. Ive bought atleast 12 different orders and havent been disapointed yet.",
      "It would be better if the freelance service provider are allowed to talk one on one with the end user/ clients; at least 2 times, so that he gets a more clear idea about the clients requirements....it will save lot of time for both...else the clients will only get max of 80-85% satisfaction, and he may have to get the final draft done at his end....."

      "Will not work on android! The sale force authenticator will not work or \"approve\" the partnernet app. The fact that we have to go through 20 steps just to download an app is pretty absurd. On the website where we have to \"Connect Authenticator for 2 Factor\" that link does not show on the website so I can never approve my app making it to where I can never get the app on my phone. I wish it was as simple as just downloading partnernet and not have to go through a 2nd app that wont ever work.",

      "SECOND EDIT: For everyone still having problems with your app: give exact info about the nature of your problem, AND the type of smartphone you have. For example, \"when I input my password/phone credentials, it takes me right back to that page. I have a Galaxy A10e.\" It seems like everyone is experiencing a slightly different bug, and that info helps the IT team understand the nature of the problem.",
      "Works most of the time but still has a few user issues. When someone post a shift I can't see it, nor can I see mine once I post it like the old app. Sometimes the app stops working and you can't access your schedule or anything else. Sucks, especially when you have to work the next day and you can't see what time!! Old app was easy to use ( in my opinion) and had no issues."

Otherwise, 90% chance it's gonna crash in a few seconds.",

I love all the different settings to scan color, change the brightness, etc. Also I can choose PDF or JPEG and that has been a lifesaver as sometimes I scan things to copy into other documents. Sorry I didnt review you guys sooner because honestly I would recommend it to anyone.",

      "I use this for \"photocopying\" musical scores. The resulting pdfs are always super clear even when my hands were shaking or the lighting wasn't optimal. Adds pop up in the middle of your work, which is annoying, but it's a small price to pay to not have to make a trip to a place where I have to pay to make photocopies. Also easily allows you to send the PDFs via email and a few other apps.",
      "Sure, the ads are annoying, BUT I love this app and it's free! So I can suffer through a few annoying add. However, if there were more or they significantly interfered with the efficiency of this app, I would reconsider the high rating and using the app overall.",
      "This is the best tool!! Far better, faster and quality than the scanner on my printer. I use it for timesheets and photos as it reduces images so they can be emailed quicker or stored. Couldn't be without the fast scanner app now😊"

      "I just uaed this app last night and did a job. I love that this app is very easy to use and the way it works. So far i am only getting Meijrs listing of tasks which is good but im looking forward to different ones as well.",
      "Informative job app, user friendly. Easy to accept assignments.",
      "Terrible app instant cash out is far from instant and there's only overnight stocking at Meijer no there jobs and you have to wait till Wednesday to get paid regardless app is worthless!",
      "Amazing app, and great communication",
      "The app is a great idea, I think it just need to take off first. From what I've gathered you can set your wages for different jobs and people can choose to contact you for help. People can also put out jobs and with set wages and you can choose to accept them. On paper I agree with this concept more than any other, but with only 1000 downloads it seems like an app for side jobs for extra cash"
