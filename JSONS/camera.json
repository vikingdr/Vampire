      "I, too, have had issues with the camera on my Google pixel 2. Since December, only my front facing camera is working. It started out with my rear camera not being able to focus every now and then, and progressed to the point now where I can't even open it at all. Not through Facebook, Snapchat, or other camera apps that I tried downloading. I've essentially been told I'm SOL by the company since it is past warranty. 🙄🙄",
      "I used to be the biggest Pixel proponent. That ended today. Google broke my camera app with the latest security update. It opens and immediately crashes to the desktop. I've cleared the cache, cleared storage, factory reset... None of it works. Google's solution is for me to go pay to have it fixed. I'm only 2 months out of warranty and Google caused the issue. I'm not paying to fix this phone. I'll be first in line for the inevitable class action lawsuit, though.",
      "Google Crash Camera* Worked great for many years, but over the last few months it shutting down my phone (Pixel 2). I've reached out to Google with bug reports, only for them to say my phone is out of warranty. If my battery is less than 30%, I can't even open the app without it shutting down my phone. Maybe it's the phone or maybe it's the app, but it's certainly a manufacturer issue",
      "I thought I'd write a review after recently seeing that there is a flood of bad reviews with the same issues as me. My camera stopped working around September or 2019, since then, when new updates come out, the camera would open, briefly display what it was picking up then crash. Try again and it would load a blank, black screen which would then close the app after about 5 seconds. Fortunately I'm due for an upgrade soon, but this makes me doubt the quality of a pixel 4xl.",
      "Works great when the app is working, which is rare. The app crashes constantly, especially when switching to selfie mode. I've tried everything to get it working again and sometimes it'll work for awhile and then the same problems will start again. I bought a Pixel 3 because it's supposed to have the best camera and it's been almost unusable."

      "Absolutely Astonishing! I can legitimately see what lower res cameras look like. I've been wanting to see how long I can record without the video stopping and now instead of 2 whole hours before running out of storage, I can record up to 100 WHOLE HOURS! Not bad, not bad at all. I recommend this for anyone with a low storage device, or honestly for any reason!",
      "A good camera app. Reliable, but needed the trickery option for 4k on Galaxy Note 8. For video, please add a large Keep/Trash After Take option button that stays until dismissed. Think of the kittens. I shot 32GB last time, and those were the keepers. Open Camera seems reliable so far. Zebra for low light as well as high would be good, too. Thank you.",
      "An excellent camera app that is leaps and bounds above a lot of the factory installed offerings. Great level of control & a great interface. No ads either! The only negative is that moving the camera doesn't detect changes adequately enough to prompt automatic refocusing. As a result of that you have to touch to focus a lot more than you would expect.",
      "So much better than the stock camera app! My phone came with a camera app that took grainy, blurry photos, along with poor lighting compensation. This camera app has solved the problems present with the stock camera app, and then upped the game by fully utilizing the phone's hardware to take great photos! Thank you to the developer...no being held hostage by ads, a great developer website with easy to understand instructions for settings, and a feature rich app for novice and pro photographers.",
      "Absolutely excellent app! Only think I miss is an easily accessible user-made presets for resolution, frame rates and bit rates, having to shuffle menus every time I want to change those settings is rather time consuming. Besides that, it just works, and often times even lets you take more advantage of your camera than the phone's default app."

      "I had high hopes. The filters are nice. The app is, unfortunately, slow to load and not very responsive. I had used the free version and had hoped that by buying this version, the ads would go away. They did not. Still have an ad whenever I start the app... Which make the start up time even more slow. Sadly I feel it was not worth the cost.",
      "I personally like this app, but I have an issue to where I turn off the flash, and it doesn't turn off, I hope you can try your best to fix this please and thank you. :)",
      "The only problem i have is that the app closes itself every now and then, after changing from front to rear camera",
      "Works alright for what it is but crashes every time I try to switch between the forward and backward facing cameras.",
      "This happens with every app, I don't know why, but when it comes to video shooting, the brightness it's ridiculously low, even on highly illuminated environments. The phone's default camera app doesn't have this issue, and since it shoots videos horribly, I've been trying different camera apps to fix it, and most of them work perfectly, but the same issue remains. So I don't really understand. I couldn't find anything online, that's why I'm posting it here, maybe the developers have the answer?"

      "In the manual mode, the exposure value doesn't effective when iso and shutter speed is not set to auto. Which it's not useful. It's impossible to take long shutter speed mode. I understand the camera have no aperture adjustable but you can use software to reduce brightness of camera and it have capable to long take shutter speed on it. You should try... I think...",
      "Overall the interface of the app is super great ..... But I gotta say ...I'm using the One Vision and after all the updates for this app....now the picture quality has turned out to be so bad that the 25mp selfie pic looks like absolute trash (face doesn't actually get really focused) with lots of noise sometimes and with videography, the FHD60fps just simply stutters... It doesn't feel like a 60fps video....... This mobile was actually based on photography so u guys have to find a solution",
      "I am using moto one action. The cameras are doing well...but there are some problems .. 1. The low light performance is too bad...when comparing to previous devices of moto and also to the other branded phones. 2. I am facing somes lags when taking portrait mode and time laps mode. 3. On some condition while photo processing ...it might turn into full of green color as a copy of orginal pic. Need more impro.. The better side of this cam is: > Its action camera & potrait photos after processing",
      "Hate this IDIOTIC apps video recorder continuously NOT RECORDING! The geniuses at Motorola think the button to START a recording should look like universal red circle that represents live recording. So it can easily appear in this UI that you are recording based on this universal icon when you are not. Like just make the fn button white like who told you that a huge red circle there makes sense? No as a result many dear memories are lost! At least add elements like a timer at 0:00 smh memories ⛔",
      "Please improve camera for Moto One Action. Moto one action needed dedicated wide angle photo capture mode & a night sights capture mode to shoot at night. Please help . In this Moto one action gcam does not support it. So please give the best of those settings. Please help moto one action users!"

      "Not great. From time to time the picture takes forever to capture (5 seconds or more) which is very frustrating. Occasionally when capturing video, when you finish it tells you \"unable to capture video\" and you don't even know until the end so that is easily the most frustrating problem I've encountered in any camera app. Yeah it's pretty terrible. And this is a problem that I had on my previous Moto and now starting to happen on this one. I won't be shopping Moto anymore because of this issue.",
      "Every time I open my camera, rather than capturing the beautiful moments it comes up with a notification \"Camera busy: Unable to start. Restart your phone\". So everytime I have to click a pic, do I have to restart my phone? Such a useless app. Seriously MOTO you gave such a big camera frame, but it's not even starting then what's the use. Useless camera!",
      "~~~~~~~UPDATE FEB 24 2020~~~~~~~~ The camera and pictures are now not displaying properly and look almost like the picture is scrambled and it takes a minute or so before I can get it to display without having the scrambled look. I'm looking now for a replacement because this is just not worth the effort to spend on hopefully being able to look at or send pictures. I've got an $800 phone that can't take even a decent picture anymore!",
      "I've been enjoying this camera app on my Moto e5 for over a year. Four days ago the camera stopped working and displays a restart camera error message. I can't screenshot or download pictures. I can't change my display pictures. I've tried everything I read online (from clearing cache, force stopping, uninstalling, safe mode) to no avail. Please Motorola can you fix this annoying issue?",
      "Camera error. Please restart camera. Every time I try to take a photo, I get this error message. I couldn't take any photos of my kids opening their Christmas presents today and those are memories we can't recreate. I've tried every troubleshooting suggestion from Moto's website but nothing works. I really hope this will be fixed soon!! Moto g5 plus user"

      "I've tried nearly every camera app over the years using many androids incl. Microsoft and Apple products. I've also used many image editors. From stock apps to apps that I pay for, Camera MX is the most ideal. This cam has been reliable for achieving a certain crisp quality I like and it's layout is easy to use. The filter choices are good and the manual adjustment for each was a great idea.",
      "I really like this camera app and it's advanced features. I have to say though that the default settings are rubbish. I took some pictures that on the camera looked like it was capturing what I wanted and when I later checked them out in the gallery they were cut off and in the wrong orientation. If it were just that I had to rotate them that wouldn't have been an issue. Thankfully, they were not important pictures and I will keep playing with the settings.",
      "Of all the apps I've tried, this app gives the most realistic and natural photos - and is also the simplest to use. Others apps over-saturate the colors and over-sharpen. The stock app on my Galaxy S7 is also guilty of this. I use it at 100% jpeg level, sizes range from 3-6 MB per photo. Great app!",
      "This is one of the better camera apps in the Google Play Store for sure. The reason for 4-stars is because the edit options lacks two (2) functions I frequently use. (1) no perspective correction, vertical, horizontal, free-form. (reference Google's Snapseed implementation of this function.) (2) No batch text / image watermark support. If these two functions are added I will change my rating to 5-star.",
      "Mostly good app. Easy to take good photos with exposure control on pressing the screen. Good live photo and decent panorama mode when it works properly. Sometimes the panorama does not record the full pan. A few glitches: hdr is horrible in latest version with ghosting; when clicking to review photos from the gallery, it kicks me out to the camera instead of opening the photo. I would pay for an app like this if the bugs were fixed. But it's free and rarely updated"

      "I install it on Every New Device I Get (at least 4-6 a year, last couple years) ! I enjoy it Highly good camera , great filters , easy to share , I like it more than most preinstalled camera apps. Has Ads Sure but they have Design Costs to Pay so Give em a break , besides that they only when you open & close the App each time (unlike a few others I have used) . Thank you for a FUN CAMERA App ! ~ Michelle PoetWolf ~",
      "This app can not function without SEEING YOUR CONTACTS, WHYYY would you need my contacts to take a picture? Stop selling people's data! - Opens slow, has to show me an ad every time I want to take a picture - by the time I clicked the ad away, my target has already moved behind a tree... ... And then the app still has the audacity to beg for a 5 star review? Imagine me kicking you in the shins repeatedly, then saying \"please rate me 5 stars\"",
      "Now the camera is freezing while taking pictures while in certain areas and when pressing the camera icon to take pictures they get delayed and never go through",
      "Absolutely no reason this app needs permission to access contacts. Clear attempt to scrape people's personal info. Uninstalled immediately.",
      "Get rid of the ads and also all the garage content."

      "Despite the nonstop ads this really helped to amp up my 4 yr old phone. I was debating on getting a Samsung so I thought to try out the camera first to get used to the functionality. It's cute and I'm down whatever the Devs are on cuz good job.",

      "video camera have had a good half hour diving through settings at random, & having a lot of fun in the process! So far, Im thrilled by the results! This was in all truth, a totally blind test, I didnt do anything logically, just took shots at random, but am so encouraged by the results as to want to do a planned testing of different settings to see what I really can discover, & am looking forward to it immensely.",
      "This camera is one of those \"close 5 ads before use\" apps. It sucks to close ad after ad after ad, after ad before you can take a shot. Especially when trying to catch a criminal act or your child trying to so something for the 1st time. Take your chances, you've been warned.",
      "video camera I just love the filters. And it has other options to edit your pictures. One of the best camera and edit app I have found yet, and I have downloaded a lot of camera apps. I use this app to capture and edit pictures for my eBay seller account. And I use the free version! Thank You!",
      "photography Excellent camera app. After downloading so-called zoom enhancer apps that do nothing, I was sceptical about all camera apps thinking that they would be limited to the quality of the lenses. However, when my phones camera stopped working I had no choice! In a way Im glad it did as this app is far superior than my phones one. I took identical shots of previous photos and the results were sharper with reflections reduced and darker areas brightened! The functions are better too. Recommended.",
      "After reading all these reviews I decided to check on it myself. Well I am amazed. My phone is a Galaxy S7 Edge. It has been through quite a rough time 100 little cracks all over the front glass. One crack goes straight over the front camera, which gives me a slightly blurry with light reflection on my pics and videos. Amazingly the newly downloaded camera has managed to clean it up a bit the rear camera is also producing crisper pics and videos. Absolutely amazing. I tried other cameras. Nada. camera"

      "OMG! AN ACTUAL, BRILLIANT CAMERA APP!! Finally, someone has done some thinking! This one showers us with a huge stack of scene and filter options and various, all practical settings to tweak and perfect our photos before we get going. But, what I am completely blown away by is the remarkable improvement on picture definition and sharpness, over and above the quality of my phone's native camera! All I would add to it are a grain effect for all photos, and a panoramic. Otherwise, FLAWLESS!!",
      "Can't find setting to change where to save the photos etc to SD card not main memory. I didn't have SD card when first got mobile. That's why it's not set up for on main. Zoom control on screen being in the middle is a pain because I use screen click to take photos then zoom jumps in would be better else where on the screen thus I don't use it",
      "I've had 40 cams just off of play store alone like it's not even funny but this camera has one that I've decided to keep its the best camera I mean what can you say I mean there's so many settings and everything kudos for the person or persons who has designed no ads over powering my phone with their bugs and also one more thingthank you so much for the video camera app I absolutely enjoy it if you guys haven't checked it out you should because they're awesome💪☝️👍🤟😎🔥💯💨👌✌️👆🤳🤝🤜?",
      "Recently installed the app and it is working fine.Went into settings and did some personal preference settings.Everything was explained well and easy to adjust.Took a few practice pics and turned out satisfactory.Looking forward to taking more pics.Glad I come across the app.",

      "Good app, but it doesn't show the exposure value, or at least i haven't found the setting that enables it. It will be great if the exposure compensation could be manually set, like othe apps allows it (i.e. Open Camera, Hedgecam2 or ProCam X and this ones are free camera apps, even the stock app from Samsung has it, on the Pro Mode). For a paying app, is lacking this feature. The UI could be more polished too imo. I will up the rating to 5, the day i get access to this :)",
      "Your experience may vary depending on model of phone. I have the OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Edition. High frames rates are inaccessible for both cameras but the fact you can change them is a great boon for videographers. You'll need the native camera app for 4K and 60 FPS options. For recording at 30 FPS footage both front and back cameras it works excellent. Face detection works, stabilization, choice of audio source whether phone mic or external, and has other controls like ISO, WB, and shutter.",
      "Wasted money on an app that instead of recording live video , it gives you a still picture with audio . Very disappointed. Feel ripped off . Zero stars . Update March 15th still doesn't work and havent heard a single word from the developers. Hey jerks ! How about a refund ?",
      "Using a Samsung S9 to record video. The app works fine in auto mode, but when I switched to 25fps and/or manual ISO and shutter speed the video began to shudder, as if it was asking too much of the phones system. But filming the same setting with Filmic pro works fine",
      "I was recording a 1080p video resolution with 60fps. And all of the sudden after 15 min of video recording the app went black. I lost my footage (a very important one) and now the app refuses to work, it stays in black with an error display that says Camera Error!. So I paid for an app that I can't even use anymore. I restarted the phone, reinstalled app, cleared cache, I've done everything and nothing works.. what a waste of money and time!"

      "I guess the camera is fine and if you have an older phone then it may evenbe better than your native camera app. But I sfrongly dislike this app's aggressiveness in trying to be the main camera app. It even installed, without prompting, a notifications icon that I didn't recognize and needed to try it to see what it did. After I saw that it opened the app and tried to close it, I was prompted to leave a 5-star review. It's really simple: If your app interrupts my work flow then it sucks.",
      "It couldn't take video's and had constant ads. Overall wouldn't recommend.",
      "My go-to camera app now that Samsung has destroyed the native camera with their latest update. Works great, a little slow, and getting a pop-up ad in the middle of trying to take a picture can get annoying, but overall a good app.",
      "I love it because my brother is he had he had deleted my other one and I was looking for like cameras and I found this one is like the best it's not difficult for me at first because I was like working and then I was like oh my God just so easy so yeah thank you",
      "Still testing, but software is indeed very small. Besides this, this camera app less likely to crash due to phone hardware problem."

      "I may have found a replacement for my most favorite camera, the CFV-5! This has all the controls I like, and a few that have me scratching my head, such as FP and the \"zebra stripes\". (I'm sure FP is neither Floating Point nor Focal Plane!) So, hurry and download the PRO version while it's free! (BTW, I d/l'd the PRO app to my oldish phone and was upset that the \"new features\" were not there; d/l-ing to my newer phone brought them up, at the price of losing SCN mode. _This is the mfr's doing. )",
      "A solid 4 stars! 5 stars for manual flash options in manual shooting mode. I often shoot in the dark with a longer exposure and definitely don't want to use the flash. Currently I need another camera app for doing lightpainting. 'Touch to Focus & Shoot' or only even 'Touch to select focus point' would be a perfect option. I choose my manual settings and would then like to focus and shoot. Now, touching overrides my manual exposure settings. Frustrating. I wonder why the ISO selector shows a one stop lower value than the actual?",
      "Elegant GUI with some innovative aspects. I don't like disabling of Flash Off when the ISO is locked. Biggest problem that will prevent use is failed setting of Storage Access Framework to save output to microSD - it always saves to Default internal DCIM regardless of any microSD folder selected, on both old ZTE and new Moto phones.. Purchased on current $0 sale so as an \"owner\" I'm hopefully looking forward to future development of a more usable app and I will rerate the Stars then - for now the app is not being used.",
      "In Lite version, I could choose SD resolution and 1~10 Mega bitrate. And it has had 5 min film limitation. Today I've purchased Pro version. But SD resolution and 1~10 Mega bitrate options were disappeared in Pro version. Why was it removed? Could you restore that features?",
      "This is better than many of the video apps on here and has many great features, but annoyingly I can't change the white balance temperature. All that is available is the presets that work OK, but I can't make changes on the scale. The phone I am using is a huawei honor 9 lite."

      "This app can't save any edited photos on my phone, it suddenly stops for a while, and back to the original photos. I don't know what is happening. Please fix this problem or give me some advice how to stop this annoying problem because this app has a great filter, and it's very satisfying to edit some photos with this app. :(",
      "Does a nice job of editing, but I’m not sure if $29 renewable is really fair, maybe to purchase it outright. Afterall, there could be more to the editing, like giving you greater manual control as well as using sliding bars, and a way to remove a noisy background or at least blur it. Adding a clone brush and eyedropper would be nice. All those stickers are not necessary, maybe teens like them. I’d rather have more powerful editing, and fewer stickers and filters. I also wish that you would make it absolutely clear when you download the app that you will not be able to save your edited photos unless you pay. I thought that was just broken.",
      "It's good and all but too many filters were VIP it's not really fair. I just want to take selfies without having to pay for the filters I want to use. I used to love this app because all the filters were free but now I don't like it as much. I am kinda sad that the old filters were removed. Anyways Please add less VIP filters if you can. I will still keep the app but It's two stars for now.",
      "What the hell why are you change the filter all the time.. I want candy filter again... ...not cotton candy filter. I want only candy filter.. I use only candy filter in camera 360 in my phone and this time you're remove this filter and cotton candy in not good filters",
      "The app is good, the only issue is add my own song to do a video. If theres a feature like that how can I do it or please add it to your next update because it's really important"

I keep waiting for something negative to happen, like being blocked from features, so your forced to buy the premium version. So far I've only been editing some pics and everything worked fast, easily & efficiently. I haven't been impressed by an app in a very long time, so this is such a nice surprise.

      "I love this camera and editor. The filters are wonderful and the variety is sweet. Even the free version has a ton of content to it, and my main criticism would actually be the per month subscribe thing being the ONLY option ,5 big ones each and every month. Now I'm all about supporting g the dev's and these guys do deserve to make money this is a great product, but I'd love an option to buy outright. Other then that takes amazing pictures, cool editing options I love love love it!",
      "Creativity at it's best! This is the first ap I've used like this after getting creative with photos through portraying images. I'm still experimenting but I find the cartoon one awesome and sometimes it turns into a whole different imagine but I can keep the image if I like it or delete it, all the while keeping my original photo in tact. Had been wishing for this for quite awhile. Fascinating results.",
      "This is too much money! I love the creativity in this and I get that they need money! But when I try to use some tools,EVERYTHING COSTS MONEY! I don't have lots of money so this is not the app for me! Everything here is 12.99$ I would not recommend this app to anyone with only a little bit of money!😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧",

My major problem is that after taking s shot it saves it no matter how unfocused or bad it is as the preview doesn't exist. Goes straight to the saved folder. 2/5 could be 4/5 but the intentional placement of the ads are click bait and that for me is thumbs down.",

Please fix this feature :(",

      "Awesome,so far... Really really really what I've been searching for in a camera app. Been using it a lot for my job. It seems dependant on cellular signal to much.. Glitching if you have low or no signal...lock ups, crashes.. At times full phone restarts dont get it up. I like all the features but now Im suspecting theirs some data mining here to see what you see when you take a photo. I hope Im wrong,but why is it so dependant on data signal to run correctly..",
      "I'm pleasantly surprised, this app delivers sharp, good looking photos that aren't taking up too much memory on my phone. It is better than the native camera of my phone. Thanks!",
      "I can't figure out the controls. All I want to do is manually set the shutter speed, but I can't find the controls to do so. Needs to be more intuitive, or come.wirh instructions.",
      "The app is good let you click clear contrast pictures from the mobile. But the brightness issue is there. It clicks too much daylight exposure Some of the setting are really good",
      "Great app!! It's great to see my phone click more quality pictures that it is used to. 5 stars!!!!"

      "Good morning, I don't know why but today my device was scanned by the antivirus and it appeared that a malware or virus called scam-app is in the app I downloaded directly from here and when the antivirus scanned again it appeared that the same malware or virus was still in the app and the only available option in the antivirus to get rid of this is to uninstall the app. I hope you can solve this soon so the app can be totally free of viruses and malware.",
      "(1) I used this app for more than 10 years, with it's private password protected storage vault. But just like everybody else, they got a little taste of success, so they had to get greedy and start charging for every pissy little' option and add-on that used to come in one big bundle for free. (2) I just installed another old app that I used to pay for (Go SMS Pro) these two are tied together, so I'm gonna give them another chance.",
      "I opted in for the FREE 3-DAY TRIAL, Nov.10, 2019 and cancelled my trial Nov. 11, 2019 and was charged on November 12th. I was able to do much better picture editing with an app that I already have installed on my phone prior to this SUPPOSED FREE TRIAL I want a REFUND. My card should have never been charged. I wish there was a way to give ZERO STARS for my review.",

      "I would give 0 stars if possible. They offer 3 day trial 'cancel anytime'. I have tried everything and I cannot find a way to cancel my subscription, the instructions they gave me do not work. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO PAY FOR IT"

      "Great little app. I have various ipcams from different manufacturers dotted around my house keeping and eye on things. They're all cheap and cheerful and work fine, but they all have their own proprietary apps, which is a pain in the behind. I have been looking for and tested quite a few generic apps and this is the very first one which has managed to link to all my different cams with no fuss (or indeed at all). So impressed, I paid for the pro version, even though the free one does all I need.",
      "I've been able to view a variety of camera brands remotely with this app. Didn't have all of the brands i own listed, so some research and trial /error required to find the right config for each model, but i haven't found any software better at that yet.",
      "I have had a more popular camera app for a while. It kept locking up every few weeks to a month. I decided to take a chance on this app despite low reviews. I am very pleased. My camera wasn't listed but I knew Onvif would work. The zoom feature is way better - a bit pixelated but I can tell what things are much better. I do get a message daily that camera has timed out, but they usually come right back online. Still, it is way better than the constant refreshing/churning from my old app.",
      "I tried this and while it looks impressive it couldn't connect giving a 404 error. I really wanted to see what notifications are like, i.e. if there is a thumbnail of the event, if it works well enough. But to do that I have to go Pro. Since I cannot connect at all, that isn't an option. Thank you",
      "I have several cameras around my property and in my house to watch my dogs and the outside of my house. I can view all of them from my computer while I am on it. Very good to be able to do this. This app works like a champ. I would recommend it to every one that has cameras for security."

      "Works perfectly fine on my nokia 8.1... Seriously the zoom, filters, video recording and other options were so good.. I normally like nokia cam but with this app and the way it functions is really awesome.. I think nokia should take the software issue so seriously because as per hardware it's awesome but the way nokia treat it really bad.. Come on nokia u can do it..",
      "I'm using pixel 3XL and... I must say ... Having GCam and still keep this an app for camera.. is a big compliment in it self... Very impressive apk ... Just a tip pro version is a little costly .. or else can i say it can be a good buy too* ..",
      "This app is crazy phenomenonal!!! I only downloaded it 10 seconds ago and I love it. Wish there was a watermark option for the photos but I can live without it. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾",
      "It's the most perfect app🤍 I've tried many iOS 13 launcher cameras and this is the best one I've ever seen😍🥰 But it would be also good with fast and slow motion effects🦾",
      "Its an amazing app but I've tried all aspect ratio settings however the picture clicked somehow has a vertically elongated aspect, ruins the beauty."

      "I've tried many photo apps and this is one of the better ones, although not good at all in lower light conditions. Unless I'm missing something, I can't find any settings to control lighting in low light. As an example, the TV in my office is in a corner that's out of direct lighting, and although that area looks okay on my camera screen when tapping for focus, photo turns out extremely dark. Also noticing over sharpening, which I don't like.",

      "This is a decent app but they want you to RENT their software. I dont RENT software. SORRY GOING TO HAPPEN.. Also the app has been crashing and telling me to restart my phone each time . It is not dependable when you really need that shot to be taken . So they can let me buy the app and get a fair price or I will keep using it for free and ignore the advertisers and they can make pennies.",
      "Have just got the new apps for my Samsung S8 - Silent Camera, Silent Video, Scan from Photos, QR Code Reader, QR Code Generator, and others [Text Scanner (OCR), Art Filter, Link Camera, Album (Images and Videos Albums), and more]. Have not installed all of them, yet! All are accessed from the pull-down list of available apps (the standard apps are WiFi, Bluetooth, Location, etc). The new apps are included in the list making it very easy to use these excellent apps. ALL 5 🌟. Thx team, great apps",
      "I want to adjust the focus when using this camera but it dosen't have that function so it makes me feel that it is uncomfortable to use.",
      "Oftentimes capture button on the screen is not responding. Nothing happens when I press it. If I turn on flash and try to take a pic, the flash light turns on until I quit the app and picture isn't being taken. Shutter is kept for volume key also, 90% times that's also not working.",
      "It takes too long to focus and the doubble button trigger works too slow.. Ietts see how the new app is??"

      "It shows better detail than the stock S7 app with less noise. The file sizes are smaller than stock pics. I didn't see an option for compression level like other apps. The front camera compresses the pics to about 600kb, which results in airbrushed look. It compresses more than the S7, which are over 1MB. I like seeing my lines, facial hair and scars. It gives the option of RAW format and save location. The RAW looks good for the main camera, but the front produces a pic with a green and yellow filter. If it had compression level, I would give it 5.",
      "Having had a Nikon DSLR -& tested the other wannabes apps -Camera X is the closest to DSLR quality I've downloaded. Other cam apps either lack depth of field, are too sharp when enlarged or display pale colours. This app addresses all those issues. And since HDR mode was added my pics really pop- with minimal grain. FIVE STARS all the way !",

      "A lot better than the stock camera app that came with my phone. The only reason why im giving it 3/5 is because on a few rare occasions the app doesnt saves the photo correctly, and the photos came out pitch black or sometimes only part of the photo was saved. But im hoping this are just minor bugs that can go away with an update. I'll update my review if anything changes.",
      "For whatever reason, this app can not actually record at 25fps. I'm on a Samsung s10+ (exynos) I set the frame rate to 25 FPS. All other settings are at default. It says in the interface that it's recording at 25fps. But examining the file shows it to be 30fps. I wish I could transfer this low rating to Samsung, who I think is largely responsible for this incompatibility.",
      "Simply the best camera app on the play store. Hands down. I was a avid user of Opencam before giving Hedgecam a shot, and I'm not regretting it at all. You won't find an app that'll give you as much control over your phones lens than this one right here. Worth at least one go... You'll probably never leave.",
      "Would be pretty useful to have an \"Output format\" quick option on the pop-up menu which would allows the user to choose between JPEG, JPEG+RAW or RAW only, for photos. Or even just an option in the photo settings menu where users could opt to RAW only, given that right we'reforced to JPEG+RAW or no RAW at all. The app is very well feature packed and the high amount of options it gives the user is indeed a pretty useful and attractive trait!",
      "People if you are looking for a high quality Photography app, This is it. I installed and uninstalled about 15 apps before I found this. My Note 8 screen looks amazing viewing thru this app. Full featured, high quality settings. and wonderful results. Honestly. Thanks. Finally."

The developers doesn't seem to show interest in fixing its performance issues and this app hasn't been updated for quite some time. But in fairness, this camera app has a working and decent time and GPS/Address stamp with no fuss. It works better than the competition.",
      "Pretty good! I'm suitably impressed! Reminds me of Hugin Panorama Creator! The only suggestions for improvement I might have for this developer is (1) to save the \"build\" images to a \"scratch disk\" (possibly on a memory card) in the background to prevent running out of memory; and (2) keep the \"build\" images live and separately editable; (3) add the ability for live editing and reordering of each image in the stack before rendering the stacked image.",
      "good quality but it take way to long to snap a picture. I hade to hold my phone in the same place for 3 seconds to successfully take a nice picture. The quality in low light is good. Just wish it only took a second or less to take a nice stable picture.",
      "I've paid for the pro version. For some reason every picture I take has a yellow cast to it and for the life of me I can't figure out why. I've tried adjusting every setting I can come up with but it doesn't go away. Obviously, that's not good. Can't use this app under this circumstance. I've got the Pixel 3a XL.",

      "After the update i cant take proper pics i thought it was complaint of my phone i have restarted.. and uninstalled so many times... When i check it on another phone the same problem happening please fix it up... The problem is if u take a picture in any of these filters it ll become a half green and another colours that side... It is the problem kindly fix it up..",
      "Earlier I was a big fan of this camera app , I was able to click really cool pictures with those super cool filters ,but now these filters appear on the screen but after clicking the shot I'm not getting the picture as it is supposed to be with the filter Please work on it..🙏🏻 Thanks for making my gallery beautiful. 🌸",
      "Older version was much better than this one. Picture quality is not good now and I am getting a green stripe at the edge of the picture after saving it in the gallery...I am using oneplus 7pro. Not happy with version at all. Was very happy with the older version.",
      "Whenever I click a photo it becomes enlarged actually elongated. It seems like an alien face. Now I like to use the original camera. If it's app's fault then fix it and if not then tell me how to fix it.",
      "There's something wrong with the updated version, a green strip is coming along with every picture. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times.☹️"

Did you really need to do this?",

Thank you. Have more options! Maybe more access to locked content may encourage more users! Just a friendly suggestion. Keep up the outstanding work!",
      "I love it so much! The quality is takes pictures and saves it. However, it really upset me when my favorite filters which were free before are now blocked. I understand why you did it, but it disappointed me. And yet, thank you very much for giving me a space like your app, to create my art as photography.",
      "It was my favorite app to use to take pictures. Recently they locked most of their filters and they need to be purchased. Really don't like that. There were already many filters that were locked and now it's most of them. Not really a user friendly app anymore",
      "It's not worth downloading unless you purchase pro version. It's full of adds. Only a couple of free filters were decent, now they are also locked to be purchased. Not the best marketing move. There are thousands of other apps like this, i'll just switch to another one"

      "So good, that I wanted to have it twice, because this is Open Camera with a different name. Too bad the settings can't be configured separately, so I only need to keep one! Although this one doesn't seem to keep up with updates anymore, so lowering rating...",
      "You just stole Open Camera. Changed nothing except the name. The in-app help leads to Open Cameras help. Couldn't be bothered.",
      "Here's my actual rating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 This app is the same code as Open Camera with one noteable exception; it works flawlessly. Setup was a breeze, and use is very easy. keep up the good work, keep it simple and clean. *Side Note: I was using Open Camera but since the last update it no longer functions 1: The camera fails to save images (to internal memory or the SD Card) 2: The flash no longer works. 3: And the most important item, No response from the developer regarding these issues.",
      "A really great camera app. I am very impressed. I have taken many photos on my holiday to the far East, this app has allowed me to take great photos with ease. I even put down the DSLR and just used my phone and this app. One small bug, some times the camera preview is not full screen (mostly when exiting settings, but sometimes on app load). Can be solved by reloading app or going to settings and reselecting preview size. (huawei Nova 3i)"

      "Fine camera app with nice but pretty common features. It's a bit strange that you can't set focus by tapping the screen (at least I've got used to this feature while trying many other camera apps) and zoom can't be set by pinching the screen either. 🤷 Otherwise, you can get used to these after all, and the quality of the photos made with the app has nothing to complain about either. ☺️👍 Hope that delay between shooting and making the photo can be shorten in the not so far future, too. 🤞",
      "fantastic app. Better then all others tested . Usually my phone constanly refocuses everytime i move the the phone when recording video but this app it is not noticed at all which is what i was after. but when recording video there is no sound recorded only white noise. please fix or any suggestions for 5*.",

      "Wanted for the Filters & Mild Editing. Mildly Surprised at the immediate scene scan & detection. It was spot on. The Filters are more for it's own use, but they do work. It was just a bit harder to get to the Editing menu than other Apps. I think it was due to the button placement. Other than that, the settings menu is well thought out. You can remove app watermark there. Seems like a Nice Camera App. Good Job.",
      "I love this app! I have a Samsung Galaxy and usually their cameras often refocus or dont focus on certain things, or come off fuzzy. This app is much more clear and works very good. The only thing I dont really like is that after you snap a pic, you have a wait one second in place. If not, the camera will delay! But other than that, I'm happy with this app",
      "One of the bestest apps ❤ I used almost 80% of photography apps and I can tell that this is one of the best apps I've seen so far, especially the quality of pictures! The little thing that I didn't like is that it requires WiFi to use the filters even if they are downloaded already but it's fine. Please add more features & filters and make it awesome ❤",
      "The pictures are so high quality! The field blur is pretty good and the filters are so cute. Processing the photos takes a bit too long for my tastes, but I suppose that's the drawback when you have textures and filters to add in real time. It's been lovely using the app. Thanks to the devs!",
      "I have to say this is the best app. The filters are really classy not childish. The megabytes get high but I would rate the quality 100% amazing. Very nice effects! Please keep it like this, don't over update it. 👏👏👏👏👌💜 OH and the blur is amazing for nature shots. 🌹🥀🐞"

      "Iv been a Long Time usera of CFV5 (paid APK), so far I've used the app on every phone Iv got, up until now. The app hasn't evolved as far as mobile's cameras, nowadays with multiple cameras, optical zoom, laser focuse, etc. CFV5 app doesn't provide option to make good use of those new opt. I'm giving 2 stars just to make the developers aware.",
      "I wanted to try this app to shoot raw, but I have to pay for it, why would I pay for an app that shoots with a 16:9 ratio at 2 MP when the native camera does it at 9? Also the light meter doesn't shows how is your exposure, well, I'll stick to my dslr instead.",
      "I have a 13 MP camera but this aap gives me option to capture maximum of 2.1 MP photos.My camera supports shutter speed upto 16 seconds but this aap gives me option to increase that upto 0.3 seconds.With this shutter speed how can I shoot night sky or milkyway.Now I don't think I need a aap like this.It was my fault to believe a youtuber saying that we can capture milkyway with this free version.I am happy with my pre-installed aap.When the sky gets clear I am going to use my pre-installed aap",
      "Too laggy, is the pro version faster? When I take a photo there's a timer on the screen while it prepares to take the photo. Way slower than the stock camera. I like the features and look but too slow to be useable.",
      "I was testing it for first time and it crashed 3 times in less than a minute, the last of them leaving the camera inaccessible, I needed to reboot the phone. It's hard to make an app this bad."

      "I LOVE Lightroom on the desktop, BUT I just HATE how this particular lr app crashes so often when im using it. It crashes every minute I swear. I will loose progress most of the time on what i was working on. Sometimes it doesn't even save my work when I try to save it. I would give this app ZERO stars of I could. It's so frustrating and takes 50x longer to edit photos than on the desktop version. If this gets fixed I'll change my review, but honestly this sucks.",
      "Can't crop an image. No matter what side of the photo you crop from it all does the same action. The entire screen shrinks. If I pull from the top, it adopts the action of pulling from the corner. In fact it doesn't matter what side i pull from.",
      "Best app ever, i use it daily for several hours, however i wish they could do something about the watermark i struggle to place it in a certain position and thats because there is no preview. Its frustrating to keep saving it then find out later on its not where i wanted to be.",
      "Probably my most used app. It has nearly all the features that my desktop Lightroom has, but in my pocket. It's fantastic. However, I say nearly, because you have to pay separately for the mobile editions, even if you have a subscription for the desktop software.",
      "Wow that is amazing photo editing app. This is a very good photo editing app with which I have edited many photos that I liked very much, now definitely try once."

      "I've had the paid version of this app for a couple years and I absolutely LOVE IT!! I don't think I would change a thing the quality is superb the filters are amazing and I've produced some spectacular photos that I do r think I could have achieved with any other app. It has a simple to use and understand interface it has many but not too many filters that create a fantastic photo experience. I tell everyone about this app and recommend it for everyone the full version is worth it!!",
      "I've only had it for 24 hours and not had much of an opportunity to use it as yet. I can't see that the shutter speed can be any greater than 1/10 second. I was hoping for a scale up to 15 seconds or more. I was also hoping to control metering. I have a Samsung S10, and I'm unsure if this is doing anything more than the factory camera already does. Camera-wise I mean. It will be good to get it out in the field to see how it goes. Having paid for the app it seems I should be able to get the following, but I cannot see a way of downloading these extras. ★ FREE DOWNLOAD PACKS: ✔ Fun camera props ✔ Famous ‘buddies’ ✔ Shutter animations ✔ Frames",
      "One of the best...! 👍 Many, many, settings, adjustments for picture taking and video. Just as many filters, really professional camera app. Good addition to your phones camera. Use it daily. Thanks..😁👍",
      "Five stars, and more! Stability, shot control, interfaces with other tools reliable performance, and good for casual photography, but also has more for when you want more. I love it. 📷",
      "I have premium and I know it wasn't much but regardless it's great..on Samsung Galaxy. 2017-18 Feb18,2020 It's a fail for the 3rd reinstalled I have to say I am done. One yr and it just fails after the first time you stop using the app, just fails and no button's respond. I got the new Kyrocera II Sapphire Feb 2919 and it is either a bug or it hates my phone lol Regardless, Please fix as I love the picture quality and ease of use"

This is my second photo app. My primary produces a sharper image than this one and shutter speed is much faster. It has also burst photo option which allows me to take photos of birds in flight rather than just stationary.",

      "For those who rate one star - ads will vanish once you buy one effect - check permissions and settings before complaining Excellent Camera app and simple to use. Well integrated with other very useful apps by KVAD. In app purchases are worth every penny. Remember good features are free and premium features will add to fantastic experience. Ofcourse Developers need money to keep improving so please support by Buying features as you need.",

      "It's a great Camera/Video app with lots of live effects. The one thing that is a downer is that my OnePlus 6 phone has a 20mb camera which is way more pixel resolution than app allows. If you enable a higher resolution in a update. this app would be amazing."

I just request them to give us another feature of body shaping. Otherwise it is dope. Guys don't give it second thought. Go ahead... Install it!",
