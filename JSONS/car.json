      "I bought the offer for €2.99 for NO ADS. But still keep showing the stupid ads. This game should not be in playstore . Not safe",
      "Great game rly nice drifting mechanics which is a change from other apps. Fun to mess around, however: 1) sorely in need of new maps, and 2) the ai in traffic mode needs to be a little bit more realistic, along with the actual ai cars. But great game. :)",
      "I like to play the game alot. It is really fun but I just wish there was more space to drive my koenninsegg around like add a race track so I can drive and add more buildings and challenges and more places to go other than a airport and off road. Also add a multi- player mode if possible. It would be really cool if I could play with my siblings. Overall great game keep up the good work!! 😀",
      "I love this game, my family was quite surprised when they saw me playing it though!😂 I believe that having a night option would be nice( I prefer playing when the 'night mode' comes on)....also if the police cars could chase us randomly, that would be great(if they could just randomly come 'alive', not every time we pass them but every now and then)....idk....maybe think about it? But overall I feel like this is a top notch game!😜",

      "Game slows you down when you're in 1st place in multiplayer. That's so frickin stupid. WHY?!?! Tempted to uninstall this half@$$ game. Nobody wants to play a game that has internal cheaters. Also, the winning prize amounts are ridiculously small. Probably just like ya'lls ~! I'm more than tempted to uninstall this. I'm uninstalling this dumb game!!!",
      "This game was great, and it still is but I found some issues with the game. One is that when you pass the first place car, your car starts to slow down accelerating wise. Even without needing to repair your car. (This bug usually is more noticeable on longer tracks.) Your cornering speeds also slow down once passing 1st place, which usually leads to just getting passed once again. I don't know if this \"issue\" is meant to be in the game, but a reply to this would be nice. Otherwise all good!",
      "OK. Computer cheats you. When you take the lead in races, it cuts your top speed, therefore the computer catches you up, and generally runs you off the road. So your top speed in second place could be 170 mph, but you take the lead and suddenly you can only hit 160 mph, then they nudge you from behind and put you in the wall. OK game apart from this issue. Would happily give it more stars if it wasn't for this.",
      "This game has potential to become something very special, it merely requires better execution and bug fixes. Even with all it's problems and the fact that Martinsville is literally impossible to win in championship it is still the best Nascar game on the market right now. Tweak the difficulty, put in more racers and more racer variations, and maybe fix the points and wins system. This game can truly become special if my advice is heeded.",
      "I hate the fact that the AI can spin you out at the start, and for some reason rarely you spin out automatically even though your on the track, and for some reason your car is a magnet to the wall. But good job your game can be fun with the right mindset."

      "I love this game and how well it's been developed, but there is one thing that was removed that I think should return. That would be Tilt Controls. I remember when the gas and brake pedals were just there for that purpose and you had to use your devices built in gyroscope. Now with the Tilt. Controls gone, it makes it harder in my opinion to traverse the lands. This would be a great addition to the game on its next update if it gets one. Thank you for reading. 😁😁",
      "Love the game and put in the time to unlock all of the stages and vehicles, which most I was able to max out, but my issue is with the time and effort of collecting 500 gems to get a 500 gem container and mainly getting coins, rather than upgrading parts for vehicles from the garage, particularly Legendary, Rare, & Epic upgraded parts, which is very frustrating to say the least, fix that and get a five star rating from users of this game like me.",
      "The tracks are fun and varied, the car selections aren't always about maxing performance so you can have fun seeing how far Santa and his reindeer can make it on an alien planet. Progress can be a little slow at first, but it speeds up after you get good at tracks and cars you enjoy driving. The one thing I absolutely hate is the custom car garage. In theory it sounds awesome, but slowly unlocking upgrade cards from chests, spending tons to upgrade, and then the cars aren't as good as basic cars",
      "Hill Climb is fun, but last memory is very very weak! If I quit game on the ride, all gems & money I gained must be saved automatically! Booster is 30gems each, if I buy more than 1 booster the cost must not incease it the waste for nothing! Booster must be 30gems each even I buy more than 1 boosters same time!",
      "The more i play the updated version the more i wish i had the 2013 version game physics are nothing like they use to be vehical rear ends are too bouncy and the super off road looses its back wing too easy and it kills the driver when u land flat on the track or just hit a wall head on please fix these issues then my review and rating will change."

      "I've played this only for a couple of hours and this game reminds me of Test Drive Unlimited 2 with a gta twist. Extremely addicting, but the only thing I can wish for is crash physics even though a mobile device will not withstand the output. Overall a must see for yourself👌",
      "So far the game is fun and addictive. This is the kind of game I would love to see on the consoles. (More improved graphics and a story line with it though). Theres so much to do, your never bored. Only thing I'd like to see is more vehicle customizations. For example, body kits, spoilers, brush guards and bed bars with off road lights for the trucks. Lift kits and big meaty tires for the trucks. Other than that, this game is fun no matter what anyone comments on here.",
      "This is probably heaven for me. It feels like you are in reality and just living the dream. If there were 6 star I would give it that. I can not describe the phenomenal amount of fun you could possibly have in this game. 100% I would recommend this game to another person. No other game could be so impressive. I think it was worth it to give all your time to make this splendid app. One more thing and you could be rich. Add supercars, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin. Read this and become rich.",
      "I have problems with the game, the first one is, when I play online it lags too much! 2. Can you let us make private lobbies online so we can play with friends because I can't play with my brother! 3. Add more cars and more missions and more wheels and make the houses cheaper. 4. Can you make a flood in the map so we can drive in water with our cars like in real life, because once we get in the water we die! 5. The map is too boring please expand it and add a weather cycle and a jungle with mud",
      "This game woulda had a 5 star if there was more fun stuff to do. maybe think of putting more cars/trucks in the game. More fun missions. More cop kind of missions. More real things that we can do and more houses and also more cars driving around the city. Maybe add more or make the city bigger. Make the person that we can move around do more maybe( i know its a car simulator. But hey. What can i say its a good game. I like it. Wish there was more to it 😔)"

      "I starting shopping for the exact car I wanted about 3 weeks ago. This app makes it super easy. Punch in your zip code, specify make, model and price range and the distance you want to search from your location. I found 3 cars that matched what I was seeking and the listings include current price, features and vin number. I highly recommend this app. I'm picking up my new car tomorrow.",
      "Decent application for the most part. But beware of the private sellers with a story that eventually ask for your information so they can send to eBay for a special deal that protects you both. Interestingly enough, their spiel reads eerily similar from one to the next. Lol.",
      "Search results don't match on various devices. I use the app on my phone and website on my tablet and desktop. I have an account with saved searches and running the same exact search on 3 different devices produces 3 different lists of vehicles. One search in particular turns up over a dozen vehicles when using the website, but produces 0 results when using the app on my phone.",
      "This app was invaluable when we were buying our used car. It has all of the filters you could want and gives you a rating of how good the price is. Really empowers the buyer. The ads aren't very intrusive either.",
      "I love cars. It's easy to narrow down your choices in options and the apps pretty slick looking. The only complaint I have is that there's a lot of duplicates of posts..... allot."

      "I decided to come back to asphalt 8 a month ago and there was a really big difference, I know there are more cars obviously and the worst part is that this game is slowly becoming p2w like every other game out there and the game is now way harder than I expected after farming coins is now removed except you can watch ads to get 10k coins per race or 5k. I never thought you guys would do this but anyways it was a great game you made, uninstalled.",

      "Just greedy of money. The only thing that annoys everyone is fusion coins. Prices are becoming higher and higher daily. Points have become very less in multiplayer.

      "I've been playing this game for 3 years. Only thing I can say based on the current situation & upcoming updates is that this game isn't what it was in its glory days. All that Gameloft wants is money out of its players & they won't care at all about the community's reactions. I insist not to download this game until the developers realise their mistake and change for good. Please help to restore this game to its better self. Post similar comments & drop their star ratings for the change to occur",
      "Best racing game I have played in a while. Im not a big gamer but this game has truly been able to capture me. Some peole say it's not very good in the coments but I think it's just cause they have been spoiled with expensive gifts and games. This is great free racing game."

      "I love this game but can you improve the server? Because it is a hard time for me to connect with friends playing. Also, add more cars and vinyl designs and could you add into the settings to minimize and maximize the buttons on putting designs? Then can you have a larger friend lists space and maximum number of players on a server? That is all the issues or the needs of improvement.",
      "Overall the game is great and satisfying for an open world kind of game , but i noticed two things . First it would be nice if we could create our own rooms and add our friends there becauss apparently i can't and second if it's possible try to make the maps bigger and with more details . We gamers won't care even if the whole package is bigger . We will choose Quality over Quantity Thanks",
      "Best Mobile Racing Multiplayer Driving Game Ever! Has lot's of cars, good customization. The only problems I see is the sensitvity doesn't save when putting your option. That is really it. A good could be to change the name of the game. I don't think it deserve to be name \"Car Parking\" since it's much more than that. Good game! \"I also like the new UI desighn you've created!\" 3/19 New car physics + new cars are best thank you!!",
      "This game is perfect. There are few issues like the car wheel alignment, the aventador and huracan sounds the same. Overall the game is perfect and it is my fav game. Add more cars. Great job olzhass!!! Edit: Can you add a soft top roof for the Gallardo and other top down cars so that it will be more realistic. ANOTHER EDIT: The manual shifters in the new update is good but it has auto downshifts. Whenever it reaches 2k rpm it auto downshift. Pls remove the auto downshifts because It's annoying.",
      "After the latest update, im noticed that you \"kind of\" reducing the character weight so it cant move a car anymore, thats great. But the new problem is the character movement is too fast and camera movement is pretty wild too. And your new car, camry & land cruiser had some bug, that is the vinyl placing, its kinda weird and hard to put a vinyl cause its different from other cars and the color cant change to metallic, so its kinda stuck on mate color, if you now what i mean here. Please fix it."

      "It's a gun game but I have two complaints. The first one is that they added a new fuel thing to the game and its aggravating because you have to wait 10 minutes for 1 to come to the inventory thing. Second is that the cars in the game just stop immediately and when ur behind them you have no chance to slam on ur brakes and be able to stop in enough time. Its actually 3 complaints, the third one is that many of the times that \"I got into a crash\" was not my fault but it still reduced points",
      "This game used to be so much fun... before they added the gas. I was an amazing game, at the time, it never got old, now they added gas and when you run out of gas you can't get more unless you have wifi, I wish they never added the gas! It ruined the whole game! As soon as you get the gas figured out I will give you a 5 star review",
      "Hi, I've played this game now for many months and I still find it fantastic. The controls are immaculate and the graphics are super realistic. The cars are surreal and I enjoy the different options this game offers as you can also drive a bus and a car with a trailer. The point system is realistic as the faults are what real driving instructors would note. I have thoroughly enjoyed my gaming experience and wish that Boombit makes many more simulations like this on. Ps. A bus and truck sim 👍",
      "Good to practice and understand traffic rules but still need an improvement on some parts i.e. 1) Hand break is not available needs to be there. 2) Manual Transmission option needs to be there. 3) Sensetivity of Streeing needs to improve . 4) Try to keep all control down instead of between screen like wiper , Head lamp , Hand Breaks etc. 5) At the start while selecting map it needs to show entire roads of that city. 6) Camera angle needs improvement. 7) Real Camera needs to be there in all.",
      "Oh my gosh, I just downloaded it and I've already been playing it for a while and it's super fun and so realistic With the pedestrians And the other cars and the traffic lights and your signals You're reminded to turn off and on. This game is very helpful. Very informative to help me learn how to drive."

      "So far so good cool cars fast tracks cool how you can fix your car and reset it if it gets flipped cantvwait to see what cool cars i can unlock next awsome money crates too!",
      "An engaging, high action open world driving game. I honestly love the fact that you start with a Lykan Hypersports vehicle. The active aero is lovely as well. However, there should be more vehicles, and the engine sound is gearless. There is no option for kmh, and no straight line long enough to achieve your top speed. Other than that, I love it and it gives Real Driving 3D a run for its money."

      "This game is fun. Good graphics and easy controles. And it's the right level of hard with out being imposable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I'd like a little more customisation. Also I'd like to see explinations for the chalanges. I can't see to figure out the Kamikazi chalange.",
      "This was a 5 star but lowered to a 3. I lowered it due to the camera angles changing and not being able to see certain angles anymore. I still like playing the game but get annoyed quickly and then close it due to the changing of the cameras; yes there are 4 cameras to choose from but they lowered the angle from above the car to right behind it and in the floor when going downhill",
      "Glad to see the new content although the pistons seem to now kill the cars off if the retract on them, a couple of times I've got stuck at 20kph. Keep the content coming though!",
      "It's a great game! If you like stunts with cars like getting awesome air this is the game for you!!!!",

It's even a free mode it justs times you on how many keys and coins you can get under ,like, 5 minutes and once you get all the keys you still have 5 minutes to play. I thought that I hade unlimited time to play on free mode but no."

      "My honest opinion is that this game is a huge step up from the 2018 vetsion and I understand that this is a beta but if I had to be honest i'd like the fuel gage removed and for the drift mode to be easier to swich back and forth to. An example of that would be a button, that says grip and no grip, no grip being drift mode and grip being a \"simulator\" mode.",
      "At first it looks like this game is a great game but its not because it makes you drift even if you are just turing and the cars are very bad it even pops and add in the frist 15 seconds of the game. I recomend not to download this game because its just a waste of your time!",
      "I understand this is the beta so not everything is good and still in development. I might have some ideas you might want to concider. 1.Enviroment: The area is empty. I would be nice if there is traffic or people also maybe another area to drive around like a woodland 2.More Missions: My idea is to have speed trials where you must be at high speeds to continue through while going through checkpoints, if you go below the speed for a certain amount of time you lose.",
      "You guys really have to make it easier to get money because once you complete an event it disappears and you cant participate in it again. And they get harder everytime. The cars get faster but I cant afford the cars that i need for those races. And time trials are way to long. A d make a police chase mode. Other than that the graphics are really nice I applaud to those. And I like how all the maps are intertwined so you can go any where. Nice game you have so far. :)",
      "Game was very good the graphics all very interesting to work to the play the game just one request please develop more places and mo challenges on racing and one more thing please add Volkswagen car lists also and most interesting game I never seen please just developed every week this game and give more challenge challenge it will be just a suggestion to the developers"

      "It's good. Gameplay is easy to understand, but difficult to master. I spent 4 hours in a row playing when I first installed. Do have a few concerns: first, you should get at least ten coins from a win even if you've used all of your ad rewards. Second, enemies shouldn't be able to hit you for a few seconds after spawning in king-of-the-hill games. Other than that, very good game. However, the difficulty in pretty much every game mode quickly spirals out of control. Could be better.",
      "I'm disappointed. I was tired of the ads so I decided to make an in-game purchase. It says the commercial breaks will cease after I purchase anything. I expected to see only the ads which I decide to watch. But the commercial breaks did not end. Please, fix it for me. Thanks Otherwise it is a fun game. It's fun playing alone and with friends too.",
      "Really fun, arcade style opponent race car/fighting game. It gets challenging at times to where you REALLY do need to make purchases from the store however most times you just do your thing without spending any real cash. The only thing that bothers me is if you don't know how to (properly) save your game to the cloud, if you're gonna change devices, all that progress and cash purchases are just.. gone. So keep that in mind. Still, fun game, and I still give it four stars.",
      "This game used to be so much fun. It was my favorite game until the new update. Then it became like almost every other \"Pay To Win\" moblie game out there, and now you have to wait for your \"Wrenches\" (Energy) to recharge before you can play again. If they ever remove this I will stsrt playing again but until then, I'm leaving it uninstalled.",
      "Good game, but I think that it is unfair how mach making is made.I get put best against players with 3000 health and I only have 1700 .Also LOTS of people abuse if you use a lower ranking car it cost less so you have a like 1or like 3star car like doing 1000 to like 3000! And you can beat them but let's say they get a lucky hit on you then they won because their car does what all your health is. It is helpful to new players but please make it more fair. Thx for reading to here if u did 😀"

      "I thought, \"This would be a good driving game if it had analog steering\". Then I found it in the pause menu and it is good because I like to tilt to steer, as the effect is gradual, rather than the full right, full left; on or off effect of digital steering. There's a great selection of vehicles and the car models look really good. Vehicle performance is highly customizable and some of the changes to the suspension can be seen as you make them. I like raising the rear end like hot rod. Small too",
      "Everyone get this game, it's awesome! My entire family (from ages 2-40 yrs old) all enjoy playing! It's free, the ads are short, & u can drive ALL vehicles! Everyone knows that u usually either have to buy all vehicles &/or play your way through the game to work up enough coins, gems, or points to get the ride of your choice but in this game they're all available right from the start! Thanks Mobimi Games for the coolest game ever! Keep up the great work & Keep the games coming!Highly recommended",
      "It's a good game just one problem the controls every time I drift in mountin mode i crash and when I get to the borders I try to go through it but i just crash please let me go through the borders and make cop mode and more cars!!!. And add more cars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!++++ but the game is good",

      "I had been good experience playing this game as far as I have seen some minor issues with car mirrors view not that clear, the hill climb issues when using manual transmission because the engine stalls when analog clutch is open by half instead of making equilibrium force between engine and wheels, the money issues when trying to tune the car again since after unequipping the parts and the scenery wasn't that big enough to explore around.",
      "I like the game a lot but it recently has beeen really glitchy and there are so many hackers that i cant join a lobby without finding one. Also i think you should make it so if you buy a car you can sell it for half the price without going to other players to sell it. Of coarse you can also sell it to real people for full price.",
      "This game is the best but too many things to buy like police mode, horns, and others. It would be cool if you can maybe make them free and my cars are now buggy because it wants to go and stays there and please add a tahoe, taurus,crown victoria please do and maybe make new locations on the map thank you for this game.",
      "I love it, but, please 2 things, 1:Add a sign in with google play option so dont loose your cars, 2: can u make it so when people are on single player they dont have just 1 car to drive, make it so they have 2 other cars that they choose and the 1 that that chose to spawn with, so in total they have 3 cars to drive. But still, I love it. The game is awesome! Edit#3: Nvm I dont need 18mil no more. I have 50mil rn but thanks for the offer. Edit#2: tysm",
      "This update have broken manual shifter! When I put in reverse very often it starts moving forward in 1st gear! And when I change to 2nd gear it shows me number of different gear! Game is unplayable now! Fix that ASAP!!! And please add distance view slider(like slider for trafic density) for better fps! P.S. my fps in this update is little bit better which is step in right direction but it needs more optimization(remove things that are not necesary at least on low graphics settings)"

      "The game has a built in pay to play point in it. It was okay at first with tool upgrades affordable and cars matching your tool level. Then the cars I was buying required tool upgrades for deeper teardowns than I could afford without paying real money for them. So it was either sell incomplete cars for virtually no profit, or reach for a credit card. It's also repetative with all body repairs the same, all suspensions the same, etc.",
      "The game works and can be entertaining to some degree. Core idea is nice, but the concept of car repair that doesn't gain actual value in work time unless you watch an ad or use the limited game currency to put it in aution is uncool. No mechanic puts together cars and sells them at base value unless it's a favor. The controls take some getting used to and usually have to select other parts to climb the camera to where you want to be. Painting the car is boring, needs more colors and types. 3/5",
      "The 3D repair concept that this game uses is pretty neat and is the first of it's kind that I've ever played. That being said... The camera controls are lacking the ability to pan, which makes navigating around the vehicle to remove/install parts a little tricky and slow. So far that's my only complaint. But I would definitely like to see the ability to diagnose the cars symptoms (won't start, noises, shaking, check engine light, etc.) to try to figure out which parts need to be replaced.",
      "It's hard to make money in this game, For hours you get a very small wage, which makes it very difficult to buy and upgrade the in-game tools without in-app purchases. Apart from this weakness, the game is very good in terms of graphics and control",
      "I love this game, my dad is a mechanic and I take up after him, with this game, it shows me how engines work, I only have one complaint though. I wish that they'd add more cars and engines or they could even make this game like the computer version, it would be awesome if they did but I like how this game is composed"

Want to click on settings so you can email the developer and complain about the ads? AD. Game devs deserve to get paid, I get it. But you could cut the amount of ads in half and there would still be a ton of ads in this game.",
      "Soo many bugs it's unplayable. What is with my car random flipping over while driving without hitting anything. And how the hell can you lose when it's a tie. I just tied someone at 17.900 seconds and I lost 29 trophies when it was a dead tie. Why is my car exploding when I just barely flip while opponents completely flip on their roof n slide then they somehow roll over n win",
      "I would rate this game higher, because it is a decent game. What's the reason I'm giving it one star is, the vehicle or should I say your car will wrecked and blow up for no reason at all. You are not going to win all the races, look for your car to flip and blow up for no reason it's a program flaw.",

      "This game is amazing in many ways. The handling of the car's is just a dream and this is definitely a game I would get to kill time. And BTW if u get this game, download the full version because u get the hoonicorn and u can basically beat the first 3 chapters easy peasy. But it would have been way better if u could have a free roam in this game. Let's just hope that they add it in any upcoming updates because that would be a really big game changer. Literally. But overall this is a great game.",
      "Good overall game, but what is weird is the physics. Drifting should be a risk, reward thing. In this game, you can just drift whenever, get lots of nitro, and then just speed up. Also the missions are WAY to easy when I got the Mustang Hoolian for downloading the full game. Also when you upgrade your can to make everything better, the levels fell too short. Like they just breeze by when you go so fast. Also just a suggestion, but there should be a police chase after most of the missions. 3.8/10",
      "I don't care if you guys (creative team) change the soundtrack in this game, the thing is, don't put so horrendous, distracting, annoying \"NEW\" soundtrack. Incredible how this friendship can do a mistake like this. I you don't want to rollback to previous one it's ok, but please don't hurt our ears with this awful new background music.",
      "Way to ruin a great game developers, your ads have become absolutely obnoxious. After each 15-25 second race there is a 30 second ad, so after 3 or more races you are watching ads more than playing the game. It's no longer paying to play, it's paying not to be annoyed. I keep the game installed hoping you will change it to a top of screen ad or something, but clearly you devs don't give a... so bye - uninstalling - best of luck to you. I will not be bullied or annoyed into paying to not see ads",
      "Good game. It just wouldn't give you what you need for the upgrades. You need to spend cash if you want to go farther. I recommend this game for rich people. If you don't want to spend in a game don't even bother playing, just when you start enjoying the game, it gets a lot harder. Then there comes the deals, expensive af. If you don't want to pay, don't play."

      "I am a mechanical engineer and also a software developer the first driving simulator game that I played was your April 2014 version and the cockpit view driving experience was sort of more realistic than 2017 and 2016 version.Now there is no dashboard camera movement to side or up & down while turning it just seems like the video is running while u turn.So I'll really appreciate if u think about this cz the cockpit driving experience is what I think is the most imp thing. You guys r best 😊",
      "Great game with really amazing graphics. One thing I don't like is the fact that you can't turn right on a red light. Additionally, other cars go painfully slow (20mph on a 60mph road), making the long levels seem even longer. Highly recommended tho",
      "Second Best game I have ever played in my life. It even has a challenge mode. Even has 2019 model cars. If you love fun and good graphics, download this though steering is a little too sensitive and graphics could be better. But beside that the game is awesome. 😎😂😂😂👌👌👌",
      "One of the best, driving sims. But, its a bit boring.Developers Please, look at Olhazz, s, Car parking, game. Their level of car sustomization is exellent. Please, try and equal, Car parking, s game.",
      "I love this game sooo much. I love carsand i want to learn how to drive and this is a perfect game for that. This is my favourite game and it's also on the nintendo switch. To make it better then please put n on the gear and also please fix the steering wheel because after turning it's very slow to turn back so please fix that. Overall it's a good game"

      "Good game but ran into 2 problems. 1. I can't change the name of my company, it always defalts back to Oh Bibi. 2. I had a farther along save, but then I got a new device and there are only 2 ways to retreve a past save: 1. Is through facebook and I don't use facebook. 2. is through cloud saves. I can save it to the cloud and link it to google pla games but I can't atualy get it back once I do save it. So then what is the point of saving it if you can't get the save bak should anything go wrong.",
      "great game. plenty of content, have spent hours and hours playing. With the timers they offer a video to skip, which is a lot better than forcing me to pay real cash for in game currency. Excited for future updates and future games. Would suggest(and I have) to anyone looking for a game to play on their phone.",
      "I have played this game tons over the years and I am offically done. Everytime I get a new phone it's worthless cloud saves over my original game, deleting my previous account along with all my in-game purchases. I am sick of having to constantly lose money, so this game can piss off.",
      "Our son was the one who introduced me to this game a few years ago and we played it for a good couple of years then. Took a break from games for a couple of years and this is one of two games (the other being crazy golf) I am currently playing. This one again because I have fond memories of the fact that our son and I both share a passion for car's in general, this game is for the fun out of our enthusiasm for car's since around 2012! Spent a bit of £ on this game back then too lol! ENJOY!!!!!!",
      "I really love this game, but I had an account with so many cars there and now when I download game my account is not there and I start like I've never play.. best game, but if you solve this problem game will be the best on Google play!😄"

      "Hi! So, I have a question. I'm playing on a Chromebook. But I have to use my mouse. Because of this, I cannot really enjoy the game because I have to continuously keep on tapping the buttons. I tried doing some research online on how to make the co trolls easier. Remember, I'm playing on a chromebook. So please, if you have any ideas on what I can do to make the controls easier, that would be nice. I want to use my keyboard for the controls. Thank you!",
      "If youre just beginning without spending any real money, good luck placing 3rd 2nd or 1st. (Only way to earn coins without spending cash) Everyone has already upgraded there cars to be fast af, not giving me a fair opportunity buy my first upgrade. Seeing you need to place 1-3 to get coins, I'm screwed. Not a fair playing field for new players at all. Not worth.",

Also thanks to all the great people who helped make this game it is a great game but you guy really make less adds they are so annoying but apart from that it is a great game 👍",
      "Please update the game! It's been 3 years since the last update. At least tell us that you will ditch the game developer, and fix your servers! They are hell laggy.",

      "I tried to come back to this game after not playing for a while and I'm not going to give it a bad grade but go down to 4*. I love almost everything about the game but the limited inventory. The game needs you to keep a wide variety of cars even if they are low grade ones just to participate in everything. The car limit to raise just costs too much and they never have even slightly good deals for it. Add a garage expansion discount and more fans would probably not give up.",
      "I still think the game does require updates due to a car with better handling and the same tires and ground clearance and I still lose. Very good game. Developers do listen and make improvments so please be patient with them and they can make this game even better in the future. Thanks Hutch great game and thanks for responding to people's input on problems with the game.",
      "It's a great collect and upgrade game. It's also frustrating at times but rewarding at others. Ordinary challenges have got less generous in recent months, however the recent Austin set of challenges made up for that - looking forward to the next set of challenges over the forthcoming year! As is typical with in-app purchase games, the pvp events are swamped with those who think nothing of spending a small fortune on card packs.",
      "Great game, but do the stats actually benefit a car enough? Most of them do not! The only two that actually seam to benefit are the tires and the drive train. Then, it's the acceleration and speed. How else do you beat a class B car with a class E car so easily? One other thing- fuse and upgrade cars. Do not sell them you'll be amazed by how much it can improve your cars.",
      "I love this game and have had another account with a good loadout of cars but i lost that account and started a new one and came across an issue with going through the tutorial in which it will automatically choose my cars and put them on the line up, when the guide is telling me to drag my cards down to make the line up myself, completely locking me out of pressing any buttons within the app. I dont know if its just me but it may need some looking into. Still happening after update and reinstall"

It's pretty great gameplay, though it takes dozens of levels before there is any challenge, and then in the 100s there are mysterious ramps to jump, where the car inexplicably bounces and slows down so I usually die. It has even declared me dead two seconds after I successfully stick the landing!! So I dunno what to do.",

I would give this game 4 stars because the steering is a little weird and sometimes it will say: \"would you like to leave the game?\" without me doing anything, but other than that...the game is awesome!!!",
      "It's a very nice game.its my best game.i play this game every time I see my phone.flying and landing style is very nice but when I drive the car on road if I drive the car in high speed I will see a end and and a road down of it if I go in that my car will fly like a paper in air without wing appliens so update the game make the car heavy and add some car appliences.once again it's a very nice game.",
      "This game is the best game in the world. I am a youtuber and I want to become the first youtuber to record a video of this game. The graphics are good, controls are a little tricky and the whole game is super awesome....I suggest you to download this games....Its addictive and SUPER FUN!!!!!!! Wish you all a very Happy Holi..",
      "It has 1 million ads I can't even play one level without getting interrupted with ads whenever I press a button it goes to an ad not when you're playing a game but when you go on to something you can't get out even if you watch a add don't download unless you want to waste your time is the stupidest game ever. I give it a one-star if I could",

      "Works great! Able to implement all my factory apps (Chinese headunit). The stock launcher was rather annoying with pictures of 2 album covers that would never go away. The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is simply because some of the features in the launcher couldn't crossover like the volume control and audio track selection (not a big deal, was able to disable the volume control in settings and still using the factory volume controls). This launcher is a thousand times better. Thanks",
      "Only 1 screen launcher. Why? Most other launchers have the ability to add more screens. Can't import the stock icon from app I am listing. Can't use different fonts. This is ok if you want a basic layout and stick to it. For me I need to add TPMS. OBD. DASH CAMS. FRONT CAM. ETC. So much more could be done with this app.",
      "Hi dev team Liked the interface and ease of use. However some queries 1. How to use FM Radio (Without internet) 2. How to access my Sound Files without Internet 3. How to access my front camera in my car. My previous launcher allowed me to access all these without using internet. Please help. Azar",
      "Skin settings perfectly matches my car interiot. Functionality wise works perfectly. Lots of options to chose an APP for each button. 😀",
      "Great Launcher, Nice theme, but need some improvements, when i want to use the Original music player as the standard Music Player i could not found it between the Apps, because i have noticed that the launcher can't see some of Systems apps, Like in my car i cant but the car info as one of the options because is not showing the car info app in the app list."

      "Good game, really fun and addictive but be careful or you could end up spending lots of money. Also, every once in a while they have packages of keys and cash but not enough, they need more of those packages because upgrades to cars are unbelievable expensive. Sadly I'm gonna stop playing because of this reason and I'd advise everyone else to do the same! Other wise it's just too expensive and those who have money to burn will always be better, no competition playing against the rich! Save ur $!",
      "Probably one of the better free games available. However, it does become very slow paced once you get in to the game. The new Beta showdown seems designed for you to waste petrol, and are placed with opponents that you cannot win. I guess the business aim is to get you to buy things - fair enough, the game is free. But I would much rather clean gameplay for a one-off payment.",
      "In the past three years that I have played this game it has great graphics that's the only thing I can say but as for the rest of it ain't worth a damn they want honest opinion I'm giving it to him I mean if you're new to it you'll love it for the first little bit but once you get on these Crews and stuff it's harder and harder as you go and more and more glitches and they don't get fuel like they're supposed to they usually put your concerns into an automated response.",
      "I've spent alot of money on this game so far and now I'm experiencing the same thing people are talking about. I keep having my daily rewards and money received then saying \"Things have changed and your profile will now be synchronized this will return you to the loading screen.\" When it returns money or daily or whatever I had received disappears. From the looks of it your might want to get on this before you lose more players...",
      "Good game if you want to spend real money. Huge following so I gave it a shot, it's really good until you got to the stage where real money is the only option. I just wanted a fun game to play all the time and this was it until it wasn't. If you want players don't mandate real purchases, I grinded to the last tier and now I'm done. People with twenty dollar cars rule the challenges and there's nothing left."

Multiplayer mode 5. 50+ different cars But there are some problems which are these following 1. Too many lags by even using a gaming phone 2. It some time automatically crash 3. You can't play the city parking mode day Or night both smoothly because it has toooo many lags when you drive the car ⭐ So please fix these 3 problems to make it best",
      "I love this game it is the best I have played but can you add upgrades to your cars also when I go to watch the move it don't let me out of the move and puts just a black screen and can you not put cards so you can go into multiple player dis games is great really recommend it.",
      "Amazing game! But after the update a lot of glitches appear like if I play the online test I dont get the rewards even if I win and in online race/drive it automatically comes out of the game and my tickets go waste. Please look into the matter",
      "Please also include a right hand drive version . The controls can also be reversed with steering on the right side and manual/automatic gear shift on the left side. This would further make it more awesome. I like this game very much.",

I downloaded this game because I remember the game I played back then in PS one, it's called driver. There's mission and story about mafia, it's pretty interesting if you put the cops too, so it gets more challenging.",
      "Fun game. I like the way the cars incurre damage. Lol it's kinda cool. Pretty good graphics. It's sometimes glitches where the traffic cars will go a little nuts but for the most part, it works well and is fun.",
      "I love it it! It's just what I've been looking for! =) I'd love if you added more to the map and the cars could have GPS's though. Great job!",
      "I like this game but it takes long time to open the car 😑 😐 other vise this game is fantastic, good, super we can not see the that some thing bad...",

      "This game is actually really really great. It seems very real and also i like the interior of the car. But i really hope this game can provide more car example like, alphard, velfire etc. Btw, this game is the best game ever in my life. I really really hope that this game can provide alphard and velfire. 😊",
      "This game is so great!!! The graphics is so realistic!!! There is only two problems and that is the Instrument panel of the cars... the speedometer that uses stick which allows you to recognize the speed of the car is working but the digital speedometer is not. And the map, when i go to highway it quickly turns into night and when i go back to the city, it quickly turns day. PleaseFixThoseProblems...AND PLEASE CAN YOU ADD \"MITSUBISHI PAJERO SPORT 2020 GT\"??? PLEASE!!!!! That's all, Thank you!!!",
      "I love this game it's really addictive but there's a prolem when you switch off the car and swith it on and try to drive slow or slow as you can. The car just bounces a lot at one place and than just start driving fast but you are actually trying to drive slow, can you please fix that. I would really love that, Thanks for the new cars and more updates I really love them.",
      "I really love this game, my last year classmates playing this game too and we are addicted in it when i discover that my new classmates play this game too we play together even there is a class but that is the problem it nice when we can have multiplayer offline(Lan connection) so that it is easy to connect each other. Another thing I would like to recommend that we can put some stickers logo of the cars",
      "One of the most complete car games out there for free.It involves parking, racing, free roam, upgrading AND tuning cars, visual customisation and all that in multiplayer. Few things that need to be fixed are :The steering wheel should turn to the straight positing on its own after we turn and let go of it because right now without it the controls are kind of awkward. Thanks for hearing me out."

Yeah, you will win on here and there, but there are many times, more often then not, where you will get put up against a racer you CANNOT win against, and it will you put you against them multiple times in a row.

The only thing is, please add ferrari and lamborghini, i like them a lot and i know other players wish that ferrari and lambo is exist in this game. And add more content in drift mode. I wish you mentioned my suggestion. NICE GAME!",
      "Worst pay to win game on play store. Other ptw games you can still play without spending. This game forces you to pay for absolutely everything. If u dont then you are just stuck with a huge disadvantage. I tried playing the game without spending but if you dont spend then you are forced to race with the slowest cars you can get at the dealership. I saved up cash just to buy i little better car then when i raced i slowest cars u get for some reason beat you doesnt matter if u launch perfect. 0*"

      "Great game being ruined by hackers, and the developers dont seems to care. Their ad program is horrible, with redundancy and lag. This is strange. FM/EA seem to have conflict internally...some moves are pretty much aimed at self interest and others are really good. Like F1. But they are always trying to get your credit card. Dont give it. I havent and I have most of the cars. Hoard gold.",
      "The closest I can get to my favorite game of all time, Gran Turismo. The main thing that upsets me is the pay out structure. Instead of having three currencies I think there should be one and a more common prize be cars and or modifications. But with nothing but a phone I'm happy with the gameplay. Sometimes a little glitchy but it's never messed me up.",
      "This game is awesome! Over multiple devices and several years now- a couple of hiccups here and there tht have set me back in terms of game progress, but it has not prevented me from getting back at it for good. Great graphics and realistic gameplay for sure! My issues are the having to spend precious coins to upgrade and the pay for more coins or you'll never get enough to pass the games many features....ya know?",
      "This review is actually a rewrite: My former review trashed the game(STILL, it could use SOME fixing up; find those on your own). The main problems I had were that ads for buffs wouldn't play so that I couldn't advance properly(I'm a grinder). The problem turned out to be my tablet (Verizon Ellipsis 10; don't EVER buy!) So going back and reading other reviews of this game, I suggest trying another device. With a couple of exceptions of certain areas of certain tracks, gameplay is smooth and fun.",
      "Excellent racing simulator. My only complaint is that it lacks some of the excitement of other racing games precisely because it's such a great simulation. It is still very satisfying when you find a good line and fly around the track. It's also great training for other racing games, and I think that's one of my favorite aspects of this game."

      "Wow! I never thought i will play this game so far, but here we are! Wow am just mind blown that this game is smooth only with low mb i love how the driver can get out of his car and look around. The game is smooth i love it. Keep it up",
      "By far, one of the coolest driving games I have ever played! It's extremely addictive & it is hard to stop unless you finish the course! The only thing I would add to this game is camera views, because, the way it is now, it's very difficult to see in front of you knowing full well, there may be a turn! Except for that small detail, I would highly recommend this awesome game, it will BLOW YOUR MIND... 👍",
      "It's pretty good, kinda makes it fun, even if it is just one track. It's a long and somewhat troublesome to navigate especially for a beginner, but after a few attemps, you'll get the hang of it, but the real challenge is to get to the final checkpoint without crashing, only a few has done it and I Congratulate them all, and wish the ones who wanna try this fun game out Good Luck to you all.",
      "I really enjoy playing this game! I just wish that I could play with my sisters, it would be a lot better... So could you make it multiplayer? Also it would be cool if you got to design your own characters and have different maps you could drive on. Since I've comleted all the levels there's not much else to do...So perhaps there could be missions and other stuff like that. The game is good but gets boring after a while of repeating the same thing, I think these improvements will really help😊🙏",
      "One of the greatest games I've played. I really like and appreciate the work out into making this game. The one problem I had with it is that the controls aren't really good. Please move the player joystick to the left side of the screen please."

      "This racing game has exact concept that I like, racing while being able to tussle with others on the racetrack. however, the one thing that makes this unbearable to play are all the ads constantly in your face at an annoying rate. Honestly that's what killed it for me. I even went as far as to put it in quite a bit of money into the game, the only thing that I did not get ads for was the free chest, but after the last few races getting ads after touching the free chest, I've had enough.",
      "Great game. However, Please get rid of voting on tracks and choose your reward. It takes Way too long between races, and is more annoying than ads. (The \"events\" move along at a good pace between races) Also, create better team events and prizes for winning teams. The way it is now, there's no reason to join a team. I've been playing this game for a long time, and would probably buy some stuff if there were some improvements and motivation. ( And prices cut to about half of what they are now)",
      "Amazing game, OUTSTANDING graphics, lots of cars and characters to collect, an awesome way to spend time. But it would be great if you had competitions with designing our own cars and characters (just for fun) but other than that it is my most *FAVORITE game I have ever played!!!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!:) * I have a FAVORITES section",
      "The game is pretty good but the overall experience with ads is not a very good setting. You would get an ad after each race to get a \"prize\". there is no option to not get a prize. I was fine with randomized ads. Edit: all the players are fake and they always urge you to watch ads. The fake players have less knockback than you do to create an illusion of difficulty. This game sucks. They're money hungry.",
      "This is quite disappointing. In the add, there are good graphic and quality racing. In the add, it actually looks fun. But no. Thats not how it is. The graphics are ok, but they are all pixelated unlike the ad definitly not great. It might just be me, but the game has a horrible lag. I do not have this issue with any other games. I don't recommend this as much as I want to. The only thing that is keeping me from giving this a 1 star is that the game still functions and has somewhat ok graphics."

And you are never able to proceede past the first level due to an impossible jump with no ramp and you have to pay money to make your vehicle any faster. And i dont even know if it even makes it faster or if ita just for asthetics.",

      "its so bad when you play it and you make a car it Just falls apart every time please fix this problem and you half to click 4-5 times before it lets you get it and why is almost all the parts and cars you have to buy with real money"

      "This is the absolute best car tuning application out there and that's a fact. The HD cars are very realistic it looks like a real photograph, you can spin the vehicles a full 360 and even look at the top of them. Some of the options cost money but it is well worth it and they deserve every cent. The truck configurator is the best, it only has hd vehicles, all of witch have parts that are made for the specific model, you can see how much each part costs in real life. Only game I play daily.",
      "Honestly super happy with this app. Gave me some great ideas on what to do with my car in the future. The app is a little laggy at times but i think its just fine just gotta give it some time to load from time to time..the color pallets could use some work for some morr variety but overall I really like this app. It definitely served its purpose for me.",
      "Absolutely amazing. You do have to buy certain vehicles especially in the truck configurator you have to buy a pack in order to work on trucks but on the bright side each pack only cost a dollar. I am going to say it is the best vehicle design game ive ever played because they are always adding new cars and parts and everything is brand named. (example Chevy and Rhino parts.)",
      "This game so much fun, there are so many different kinds of cars to customize with so many different kinds of parts! There is only one thing I have to complain about, and that is when they added the updated tire lettering when you change the color of it only changes one of the wheels. Other than that I absolutely love it!♥️👍 Dear 3DTuning, The cars that have that problem are the Acura nsx (new one) and really any other car that has the new tire lettering, not the old ones, those are fine",
      "It's very helpful when it comes to building vehicles. One this is I would definitely like to see more of the older trucks instead of all this new stuff. I'm wanting to build a 2008 GMC 2500hd but I can't because it's not in the game. Wanted to see what it would look like before I spend money on lifts and all that. Other than that this game/app is very helpful and you can definitely pass a couple hours"

Without the use of Carfax or a similar service, we would not have been able to know the entire history of the cars we researched. I was amazed at all the information they provide on each vehicle. We ended up getting a great used car at a great price!&quot;<br><br>— Gordon Waite<br><br>&quot;Carfax Used Car Listings saved me time. If I find a car that I really like, and then I can&#39;t get it because the Carfax doesn&#39;t meet the criteria that I want, it saves me from having to waste time now starting my search again back at the beginning. You know instead you&#39;ll just have a pool right there of what works.&quot;<br><br>— Susan P.<br><br>&quot;Well first off, Carfax.com cuts down greatly on all my frustrations because it gives me the pool of cars that I would really think about. Versus a much larger pool that I still have to sort through once I get some of the parameters down. Definitely a time reduction.<br>— Lisa K.",

Daily rewards also can't update in 24 hours, Please fix these issues as soon as possible then i will give 5 stars 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",

I spent all fuel before I went to sleep but when I woke up, my fuel tank is still empty. 2) Inaccurate reset time for daily missions. 3) Some daily missions can disappear when I swap from one chapter to another. 4) Waiting time for free unique and gold container takes forever.

      "Trash game by a trash developer that would rather spam the appstore with nearly identical garbage games than to make one actual game. They still use fake reviews as well. Their entire business model is play endless ads and throw in a ridiculously priced purchase option and pray someone is dumb enough to accidentally tap it when trying to close ads that popup everytime you touch the screen. They basically treat players like a scratch off lottery ticket.",

      "Great app but it appears your concentration is on cars for the American market. Please, spread your tentacles to cover those of us outside America. This is the best app in the world for car reviews. Congratulations",
      "Seems good for looking up specs, but the appraisal function is very problematic. It appears to use very crude formulas and does not seem to reflect the market at all."

      "I really love the app!! About a month ago,my sister-n-law was in need of car and asked me to help her find one,she wanted a used low mileage Kia or Hyundai. After searching thru several car search sites for almost a month, i came across Autolist and found a low mileage 2012 Kia Forte Ex at a local dealer the 1st time i used the app. It was a fleet car with only 36k on it and fully loaded! We test drove it,she loved,she bought! I will use Autolist again when i look to buy a truck this summer!",
      "Every time I attempt to make a saved search I get an error that says \"check your connection and try again\". I confirmed that I have a good connection by using other apps at the same time. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail. For me, this app is not functional.",
      "I've tried all the other apps, this one is the best ap if you are looking for a new or used vehicle. I love the multiple save options for searching. Everyone that I've contacted had been in touch in a very timely manner. A++++",
      "The functionality itself is great! I just wish it felt a bit more native. It feels better than a web app, but it doesn't handle being offline well. Favorite posts should be saved for offline",
      "I LOVE the search criteria. You can tailor it to exactly what your looking for. Contacting the seller is super easy. Love this app."

      "Great game. Graphics are amazing but the only problem I got is so I have a Samsung galixy s5 ok. Then after I am done doing the levels or races. Suddenly it just starts to freeze up. Then I have to start the game all over again. So make shore you fix that ok. Overall good game",
      "Hii ,your game is too awesome I loved it You should bring more and more changes like a big map, present map is little bit small and plzz make sure that the sounds of cars would be real as you can and a little change you maybe do it like your asking to pay real money to buy awesome cars plz I don't like that,you may bring some tasks to do and we can get that car's with out paying money........but this game is too awesome",
      "This Game is so great! It's just like need for speed but on mobile! I would definitely recommend you to download this awesome app! My only concern is that it's a little hard to race. But mostly this game is just awesome! 🏁🚘",
      "It's a fantastic game . I like the different types of modes it has , especially the racing mode . Although I didn't like the \"Wrecked\" system .",
      "The new manual transmission is good but the right hand drive version has a problem which the shifter has blocked the brake pedal. Hope you can solve this problem soon. I has been playing this game since 2016 and I love this game so much."

      "Would like to play it more but the resolution is bad (compressed) on my device and not pleasant to look at. Doesn't use native device resolution. Also some suggestions, with a driving sim this realistic I feel like we need turn signals and cruise control, and also it's annoying when other cars just change lanes and crash into me with no prior warning and no fault of my own.",
      "It is a very good game but you need to add in more cars. Plus make the graphics abit more better. Also and car noises because I hear the sme noise from each car apart from the electric cars. So please try to improve the game as soon as possible.",
      "Normally I don't rate games too much but I had to give this game 5 Stars. It feels like heaven for a car lover like me when I play this game. Best graphics of them all, as the devs rightly said. Please make the steering control more slick, though. Thanks!",
      "Every time I try to play thw gam eit kicked me out so I just decided to get rid of it but I do know if it will be the same on every device. Because ot kicked me out I only give it 1 star.",
      "Superb car simulation for highway. Realistic audio realistic physics. Close to a real highway driving with icy and even road hazards. Best one yet."

I'm playing it on a Huawei mate 20 pro which is a rather powerful phone and it's just non stop lag. If the lag didn't happen then it could be a very good game but as long as the lag continues this game will not be fun or enjoyable.",
      "Really fun to play around and play with your friends in multiplayer, but this game can improve more by fixing the cars in game they just stay on the right side of the highway the whole time instead of the cars being on both sides of the lanes this will make the game more interesting and it will look like you are actually in the game",
      "The game is absolutely amazing. PLEASE can you allow the person to enter and exit the vehicle and make houses in this game for us to buy... Especially ones which allow us to see our cars in our garages :) Thats the main one houses and garages. Please do this to the game and I swear I will pay for that game!!!",
      "Very bad Game, it is considered as phone heating App, not always responding, the career mode is very hard, not easy to understand as driving school 2017, it doesn't have levels, only challenge mode that is very slow to respond, not easy to play and understand, only the map system to know your location, the new Range Rover velar, others new updated cars with beautiful interior is the only beautiful good work about the game. A lot of work need to be done on it, Add career mode, l love driving",
      "I love the game it's great BUT the sky in the game is always bright it needs to be dark sometimes and it would make the game perfect and then we have the cars they have great cars the sound of the cars are also good I'm glad they have noticed that the cars sound like lonmours in previous games but I love the game please fix this it's getting really annoying now ovilex please fix it I even reset the game to get it to work and it still didn't work and there's no time in the game please fix this ty"

      "The game is a little harder than i thought. It operates in an odd way. It's an intetesting game but difficult to get use to the controls and watching the arrows direction. Try it. I have played it a little more. It is fun. For a game. Real driving is nothing like this☺",
      "This game could be better if the brakes actually worked. Sometimes I will press it but my car will keep going. Another thing is that something is wrong with the way the levels work. I will finish many levels and then when I come back to play I will have to redo all of them.",
      "My experience was great until I hit levels over 100. One, you lose a hit point before you even start, and others have you hitting stuff when there is an obvious gap between you and the object. Simply ridiculous.",
      "It's a very bad and annoying app it always glitches when you hit some place more than two times you have to start again which is quite unfair when you almost complete the level . when you want to make the car stop it won't and when you want to make the move it will start to glitch you really need to upgrade because if you were me you woudnt like it too one bit so nobody should play with it if you do not upgrade.😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡",
      "I find it a wonderful and a relaxing game and it is 25% like you are driving a real car the only complaint I have is there are to many ads while you are trying to play this game other than that its alright"

      "This is a fun game. It helps me learn the ways of driving. Parking is fun too. It gives you a rank of how you parked. There is a line you have to pass to go to the next level. The 2 issues that I experienced were with the wheel sometimes it moves your angle instead of the wheel and you crash, and the three stars it gives you are based on time. In my opinion, I feel that you shouldn't be rushed wheras the stars should be based on how good you park.Thats why its called a parking game. :)",

      "I don't care about ads. I get that game devs need them to actually make money on a free game. What I do care about is if they actually work. I tried it and it was an ad for some garbage sniper game, in it you have to take a shot at a criminal with a hostage. The only prompt you're given is a \"next\" button, and a microscopic \"x\" button in the close it. Next bring you to the store and going back tells you you have to watch a fill video to multiply your coins. Idk if it's a glitch or what. Trash.",
      "It seems like it takes forever to get through the levels that have anything you have to jump your vehicle through. I've been playing this one level for the past month and I can't get around the stupid bridge canopy. It also took me three weeks to get past Las Vegas and in fact my husband ended up being the one who got me past it. For that this app sucks.",
      "The game it self is very well made, but i have 3 things I want to complain -first, why aren't we allowed to use our boost if the car wheels touch the ground? I can have half of my boost and can't use it -second, we have no control of the car mid air besides the boost, I'm not saying allow us to go all directions, but being able to control where the car is pointed at the start besides randomly going up or down -third, last update maked my car flip every time it gets out of ramp in the last stage",
      "Kinda fun, but way to many ads. Others have explained that part well enough, so I'll complain about the rest. The number of cars are surprisingly limited. How they are better then each other seems completely random. Once your off the ramp the only control you have is booster on or off, and almost all the cars rotate noise up.",
      "Worst gaming experience ever... Played the game for maybe 10 minutes, spent over half of that time waiting for ads to end... Also, never had to play a game for this long just to get past level 1 thanks to the inability to skip ads within a reasonable amount of time, and lack of vehicle upgrade impact... Deleting the game immediately after posting this review... I would give a zero star rating if possible."

      "Decent fun, so-so graphics, but once you clear zone 2, you pretty much have to make an in app purchase to get a car for zone 3 unless you want to grind out 30-40+ races to get enough money for a new car (while keeping in mind that you only get 10 races per hour or so) just another money grabber with no care for the consumer",
      "Game becomes pay to play after beating final boss in zone one, you need 40 grand to buy the next car and you're left with roughly 2, while each challenge after the final boss in zone one becomes increasingly impossible. You're better off not starting this game as there's no way to finish it unless you pay or spend a ridiculously long time making small amounts of money",
      "Games pretty fun but basically have to buy \"coins\" or \"diamonds\" to get the next level up of cars. Once you modify the stage 1 car as high as you can all missions go to stage 2. Well problem is no longer can do stage 1 story missions for coins and can't drive stage 1 car in stage 2. You have 2 options pull out your card and pay for coins for mediocre graphics and controls or do the \"pick up person\" mission and build up 40,000 coins, from 1100 purse each mission.",
      "This game is a scam, they want you to pay $5 a month for a \"battle pass\" that when de activated you cant use your vehicles you got from it and the \"freeroam\" is misleading because you get only 1 minute to enjoy what ever you can of a small map which isnt very fun. All round this game is trash hard pass if youre looking for a racing game.",
      "I just want to speak up to all the people who give bad ratings based on \"permissions\". From how you are rating at one star because the game requires access to photos and contacts etc, shows me that you have zero understanding of how your phone operates. For the game to be able to save screen shots it needs access to that location, as well with contacts, want to send a friend invite, needs to be able to access that system. Spend time understanding your device."

      "This game USED to be amazing! Hands down, it was the most fun and competative racing game in the Android market. Recently, I downloaded the game again, only to feel dissapointment. Expensive cars that already require tons of cash and RP to purchase, now also require CHIPS? Erase the CHIP upgrade! Go back to the basics of cash and RP. Stop being GREEDY---> CMG!",
      "Used to love this game so decided to redownload it and play again. It's nothing like it was originally. Not all vehicle names are legit so I assume there was licensing issues (eg, Neesan?). There were changes to the graphics so some cars look toonish. The added premium chips makes obtaining higher tier cars a pain in the rear. Etc.. Why change a game that was once great into it's current garbage state? Oh well. I'll check it out in a year or two. Maybe they'll get things back to where they were.",
      "I really wish I could earn more money in the side races that are available. The career mode is great but in order to actually win you have to spend most of your time in side races for upgrades. And now there is a rewards x5 option to watch a video and get more money. But that only works 40% of the time. I also had earned up to almost 400rp in the quick races and after I sold a car I lost almost all of it.",
      "This is really fun and a great time killer ... I just wish we get more in RP and I'm losing out in extra money when I hit the button to 5x my winnings and no video would show up I have lost out on a lot because of no video would pop up it's even hard to change the tasks because no video to play I don't know if this is happening to others or just for me but would be great to have fixed it's hard to upgrade my car when parts costs 21k or more",
      "The game has always been fun. You've come along way from what the first set up was like. The only thing I see that gets in the way. Is the ads in the left corner keep you from seeing the points to the left. Adding the mile was something I always wanted. Keep up the good work. Too all that play the game less smoke more traction.

      "Way to many ads if I wanted to see them I would have downloaded a game from Voodoo. It is a good game otherwise ,but the thing that makes this game horrible is how you have to WATCH ADS TO UPGRADE ITEMS. If you took that out it would have been a better game and reviews. It also has nothing interesting about it which is why I dislike it, but it does seem like you at least took three days to code ,and you tried on the graphics.",
      "This game is way under finished after about two days you have completed the game. You rarely get your offline bonus doubler the video runs 30 secs by the time you exit it and get back to the screen the game thinks you have been offline again so you only get a small amount of the money. The game play is smooth which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.",
      "At first it was fun but after a while I noticed a button and I clicked and it said I could prestige and start new creations and so I clicked it. I thought it meant I could create my own car but no it made me restart the whole game and I already finished two cars the sedan and the sports car. This game needs to be more specific like if your gonna talk about prestige then warn me that all of my progress will be lossed and will not come back.",
      "Conversation with friend: I have an idea. Let's make one of those idle games where you can click a whole bunch of times on the screen to make money faster in the game. Perfect, sounds great. One revision though. Let's throw ads at random intervals so that when they are clicking repeatedly it pops into an ad and then they end up clicking the ad before they realise the ad popped up. Sounds even MORE perfect...but wait....this crappy game already does it...sorry.",
      "Like other reviews say, there are ads CONSTANTLY. This is the first time I have ever given a game a 1 star review. I really enjoyed the game other than having an ad shoved into my face every 30 seconds. I didn't realize it was that often until I actually started timing them. I'm uninstalling this and every other game by this developer."

Now you can't do anything in the global races unless you have them cool cars. And its not a lot of gold bar to earn unless you buy them. Should give us more then 10 after level 20.

However, in this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals when you have enough health or they are already damaged. A reckless head-on collisions with powerful cars should be avoided to prevent your engine to die or other extreme damage to occur. To boost the damage you inflict on an rival you can get your motor rev up and drive & crash faster by using the nitro boost. \r\n\r\nThe game allows you to choose from various cars (including monster truck and other big vehicles). These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to buy upgrades wisely as the various type of modes require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed, push and pulling power. Good results let you earn more money (cash) during races!\r\n\r\nCar physics is realistic enough to ensure that simulation of crashes and destruction is done really nice - you can damage car slightly or a lot, and make its part fall off and fly around if you bump the car hard enough. \r\n\r\nYou have 20+ cars to play with and 10+ maps to battle on, so enjoy demolition wars and good luck!",

I paid $6 total on all 3 ios version's 2 support the dev, but the continued o.p of the Ai ruins ALL versions on both platforms! SMH",

      "I have had this game on several different phones. I got a notification awhile ago about CSR not providing support for this game anymore because they essentially combined it with CSR2. If you want this game still, go ahead and download, but be aware, if you delete it or lose your phone, you will lose all progress and no way to recover it. So since there is no support or online play, I had friends get into the coding. Now I have unlimited gold and cash. Almost at 100% completion.",
      "It is a great game! I love the cars that you get and hot rods and how you can restore your car, upgrade the tires and rims, upgrade nitro AND.... beat people in races. Which is how you can upgrade from tier one to tier two to three to four to five! That's how you get more cars and more tiers. And it has great graphics.",
      "The old classic cars are great and all, but... The difficulty level of this game is way too high. I've been playing this game for several months now, and I'm only on tier 3! It takes an extremely long time to gather money from races. Not to mention I upgraded my T3 car 2-3 times now, and the difficulty of the races has not decreased at all, forcing me to race regulation races more. CSR 2 is way easier! Shifting also seems to be way more difficult than it should be!",
      "I love this game! I've been playing for a long time now off and on, and it's one I keep coming back to. However, this last time I downloaded it, it's been acting glitchy (weird word coloring and such), and it syncs to my google play account but I lost EVERYTHING. It stinks, because I had some serious time put into it, but I'll just get to do it over now. Only reason is not 5 stars is because I lost everything and I'm still in the salty stage. Keep going developers! We need more games like this!",
      "The gameplay is fun, but the difficulty rating could use some work; you could have a perfect race and still lose when the difficulty is only rated as challenging. Apart from underrated difficulty, the game is well polished, with a well designed racing system."

      "Love it! The amount of combinations that you can do with your car is (almost) unlimited! There are a few add-ons I would like to see in the game; first, DEFINITELY a multiplayer mode, with Drag, Street, CTF (Capture The Flag), Touge, and Tournaments modified for Multiplayer. And Second, please be able to make an ONLINE shop or an auction for players. This would make the game overall even better. Thanks for making this amazing game! 😉👍",
      "This game is incredible. I love it, and my girlfriend and I play it almost daily. The controls are simple, yet effective. The tuning is super easy and it's not hard to pick up on how a car is supposed to handle. I would like to see more trucks and SUVs in the game, those would be fun to build. Pretty much the only thing I'm not a fan of are the engine sounds. Particularly how any V8 with a supercharger sounds like a whiny inline 4. Deeper, growling sounds would be awesome. Thanks.",
      "This game is incredible. I absolutely love it and have nearly 30 hours played. The reason I give it 3 stars is because they don't update it. No new features, no new modes. Nothings. The game is good but there is always room for Improvements. As someone who plays this alot I'd like to see the developers try to constantly improve it. And they do not do this. As of the date I wrote this, March 5th 2020 this game has not been updated since January of 2019. Well over a year.",
      "The game is amazing the variety in cars all the upgrades and customization name it and this game has it except for some cars they didn't add ex: any lambo, any Ferrari, any porsche I heard there was one and an AI in a race had one but that won't have it lose a star but please add some of these cars :) oh and can we Please get more car space I feel like 6 isn't enough",
      "The daily reward system is broken. I claimed my daily reward which was 8 spins. Then I turn off the game because I couldn't spin the wheel. When the game was on and I went to spin the wheel it told me I had 0 spins. Overall this is an awesome game, just please fix the daily rewards"

      "I love it, I play it every day. But every time you barely tap something it says you crashed and when you barely go off road if the directions are not clear and it says you went of road, even though it was by two inches, you need to start the mission all over again. Also when you stop for a second if there happens to be a car behind you they will not stop and go right into you then the game will count that as crashing. VERY frustrating game but additive!😊",
      "Very fun and enjoyable game but the only reason i gave it a 4 star rating is because it just keeps on shutting down when ever i crash into something for no reason.Please fix this asap.",
      "The game is really good because of the blinkers but on the other hand, when you trie to go slow and carefully, other cars just crash into you!",
      "Game over in 3 seconds in level 1. No explanation as to why the driver ran out of Road. Not point of view. Steering is oversteer. Uncontrollable vehicle.",
      "This game is so realistic, the only problem is that it's hard to drive when you go fast . Otherwise everything is ok.totally cool !"

This game maked my kid life more easier! I recommend it for kids but adults too Have a nice day!",
      "I love how the ads are only 5 seconds and some are none the graphics are perfect it's just a very good made game keep up the good work and the controls are amazing!.",
      "When i downloaded this game i thought that it will be a great game untill i chose the police level the police cars just looked weird could you make them look a bit real? Also could you adjust the speed on all of the cars because they may be a bit fast but every time i get chased on a strait road they catch up a bit until you go round corners then you get busted but there is one thing good about this game the graphics look good and there are a good choice of cars but i had to put one star sorry",
      "Almost as good as the other extreme car game. Only thing i wish there was the airport and off road like the other one. But the police car is a bonus!!!",
      "A decent game, for the ones several years old. It would also be nice if gravity existed in this game, as so far, it doesn't. The police launch you into space."

      "I Love how you can just sit there and play this and they always give you good deals. I l like how you don't need to race a lot you can just get new car your can buy cars. The races are fun they are short I mostly do races when I need money or if I what to race. It is very fun. The part that I like is when you pear up cars to get new ones that is my favorite part about this game. I play this game all the time but not to much. I am not attach to this game. It is hard to be attach to this game.",
      "Average game, but most annoying thing is that after your race, you have a (fake) choice to collect your winnings or watch an ad for 5x your winnings, even if you chose not to watch an ad, you get an ad anyway, so you end up choosing an ad for 5x your winnings - no choice really. Am uninstalling.",
      "Good Things a good thing about this game is how fast your car goes. You can easily get a new car after game after game after game. A Bad Thing a bad thing about this game is that it is hard to write your name box .",
      "First of all, it's frustrating that you can't use any of the previously unlocked cars after you unlock the next one. Secondly, I find it frustrating that I always start out in 15th place, and never get to move forward. Lastly, are the other players even real? Why am I the only one ever crashing into anyone? And why don't the other players use the speed boosters?",
      "I would rate you guys a 5 because this game is cool to play if you dont have nothing else to play with so that is why i ratted you guys 5 i love this games to much like when you go on the front page you get to match the cards up that is why i love this game so much"

      "This game is a nice relaxing kids game it's family friendly too I like this game even if you get new cars and skins by getting the chests it's hard to miss the chest. It's still a fun little game I like it :D",
      "A very well designed game. Overall fun to play and has a good challenge to it. Picking the right upgrade can make the difference between success and failure. It's more than just a driving game. In addition to unlocking vehicles you also unlock items for your farm and outfits. Farm items help you get gold without watching ads. I haven't made a purchase yet, but the iap prices are very reasonable. I recommend you try this game.",
      "Played this game a while ago when I was a little kid. Came back hoping for some nostalgic moments, but now you have to find these stupid chests to unlock skins and cars. It's a fine game, but now you have to reach a certain car to be able to make custom ones. Also you shouldn't have to go through the entire game just to unlock the skins. At least make it cost coins.",
      "This is the best game ever. The levels are so cool i can never stop playing it the game is very cool. My favorite part of the game is that u can custum ur player.",
      "In the newest update (2-21_20) when i loaded the game it said \"the game is fully free to play\". I go to import a car and it says \"unlock all cars\" and then it wants me to pay $4.99. its a shame dogbyte games ruined this game."

Races take multiple tries to enter, jobs and upgrades takes resources but don't give anything back and to top it off some currency disappeared overnight. Literally, I had a bit over 50 cash, woke up to 30. A game this unstable can't get many stars.",
      "I like the idea of the app and it's neat in all however it's really hard to follow and fyi not every vehicle is Rwd. The starting car is a passat and according to the game it's rwd. In a race I saw a fiesta st doing a burnout from the start and the rear tires were spinning. Like what? This isn't how that works.. yall need to learn more about cars before making a game mainly focused on cars and maintenance",
      "I've read some of the reviews this a fun game to play but the wait times for some of the parts is ridiculous, I can understand the times for the smallers parts but 6 hours for a muffler and 5 hours for suspension coilovers. Overall fun game but times need to be shortened. If the times were shortened I might change my review and star rating.",
      "Game needs work, start by listening to people that enjoy the game, but still left. The force of grind is too much. A game shouldn't feel like a job, it takes the fun out of it. Making people build parts to service cars just to be able to race is too much. Put the race keys on a time based refill and leave the car service station for money and the parts building for upgrades and service for cash. The races for car cards is fine. If they enjoy they will spend money, don't force them to.",
      "Slightly better than most of the low effort moneygrabs that are city builder MMOs nowadays. It does push you to spend money incredibly often, and it's a slight grind without. One big thing that Gameloft did correct is making a large portion of decorations buyable with the ingame coins, not the cash. Also has the fascinating reality where every car is RWD. I'm not complaining, but it's pretty awesome seeing a RWD Sentra and Eclipse, as well as a LHD hakosuka skyline. Decent overall."

      "The controls in the game are easy because it's easy to move the veichal and to race with others the cars are easy to get and it some of the cars are fast because it has some kind of nos or some type of fast energy in the car to make it go fast. The cars in the game are really nice and they are like pretty cool to drive in the game. But in real life I want a laberghini to ride around the rez. My brother really wants one to because so me and him could race on the Rez and back roads.",
      "Hot Wheels comes alive in your phone! Great intro to the Hot Wheels world. I played the game first then started collecting Hot Wheels die-cast cars. Trying to collect all the cars in this game. Nothing like playing it on the phone then picking up the real thing and re-living the action with a Hot Wheels die-cast.",
      "I highly recommend it because it has so many levels and cars to collect plus theres daily race of which is hard at start you get the hang of it, the only thing that a pain is in the last section you have to have 140 stars to unlock and you have like 115 star so it take a long time to unlock. I would love it if they added more levels to it though cause its so adicive (in the good way) hoped this helped but DOWNLOAD it for sure!",
      "A fun little distraction, but the constant bombardment of ads (which you're encouraged to watch in order to maximize points so you can upgrade faster) is a bit much. Simple controls and exaggerated physics... easy to recommend.",
      "Don't do it I played this game while ago, i wouldent invest $ so it seemed they diddnt like it progress & points etc started disappearing, & they tell me it's my fault I diddnt close it right whatever it happed a lot finally I uninstalled it DONE!! I was almost 100%done nothing left..stay away it is not a good game based on personnel whom u right complaint to. Wasn't my fault & you won't tell me that. Multiple times this happen. No star vote."

      "Good game, but a money grab again! The game play is fun, easy to pick up, the graphics are nice and smooth. My main problem with this game is you only get 8 races before your fuel is gone, requiring you to watch a video 😕 ok, or pay 😡. This wouldn't be a problem if the races were longer and the bonuses better, but leveling up takes for ever or costs a fortune, not a good mix.",
      "This is a good game with the potential of becoming a great game. It needs more energy, more excitement, more oomph. Give us longer and more challenging tracks with more intense water splashes, road hazards, night and day, rain (even tornadoes), jumps. Just don't be too safe with this game. So take a few risks and make it more varied and exciting, please. Please scrap the notion that you can get a car that you already own via the silver and gold crates. I know you can sell the car but it's silly",
      "Because of the enjoyment factor of this game, I will change my review to 5 stars. However the development team should know that I have already beat the game almost 2 weeks ago and I still have NO stage 5 and 6 engine resource parts from rewards randomly given during gameplay. Most are duplicates. More tracks would be nice, maybe famous ones? No game is perfect, this one is close. Other than that, it is a very well balanced and very fun addictive game to play! Thank you development team :)",
      "This is a very good game however races are extremely short and you dont get much money. There should be this system where every like 3 or 5 races your money from a race is multiplied my like x1.5 its also this game dosent take up much storage which i like alot the game also looks very good and controls are smooth. Thank you developer team for coding and just creating this game in general :) Have a nice day (edit there is also a great selection of cars and modifications)",
      "A truly great game. The only problems I have with the game is that when participating in a race with multiple other cars, it is impossible to drift corners without hitting another car. Another thing is the cars themselves. There aren't many to choose from and there is no variety. You would expect a game like this to have a Supra or some SRT cars but to my suprise all these were absent from the game. In all honesty it is a great alternative to the ever so stingy EA's Need For Speed: No Limits."

      "Ok devs. here's the deal. This game is EPIC ok, the gameplay is amazing not to mention the best graphics and it's just amazing I had a lot of fun with this game, but... There is 1 problem that I have been experiencing. The game has been randomly stopping for sometimes and I hope that you can fix it. But other than that it's amazing,you can acquire cars easily (with good luck that is :-D) and I want to suggest 1v1 or 2v2. Tks.",
      "This game has: A lot of cars, good gameplay, not much ads and more! But the only problem i have with the game is when u reach lvl 100 There is not that much to do, to solve this i sugest prestige/rebirths to the game. So this is how it will work, u will reset your progress for bonuses, u can do this how much u want. U will not lose: skins, gems, badges. The bonuses are: a rebirth car (legendary), badge for rebirth, 10% more xp (max 100%),cheeper machines (by 4 coins max 60). U can rebirth at 90",
      "Hi dev's This game is one of the best games I had ever played but I have a problem with my internet and when I play with my friends in custom room matches It automatically leaves And you should also add a symbol which indicates the network strength even ingame And please buff pirate ships (legendary car) power as it is empowered This is it I wish you add all these features to the game Thank you In advance",
      "This is the closest i couls get for a game with Twisted Metal feeling, right on my palm. Controls needs a bit of getting used to, the gameplay is simple and fun, and acquiring new cars is easy as long as you have a good luck. Local multiplayer also works well, an offline option like using Hotspot would be great tho. A very fun game to play, and i love it.",
      "Brilliant game. It's is not too easy or not too hard. There are many challenges and alot of work to be done to get max level and all the cars which is really fun.By the way you need to fix some glitches like when I start a match I sometimes just randomly die without seeing any players in my screen. Other than that I really like it!"

      "I don't usually write reviews but I feel it is important to say that this and the boats game, and possibly others are very similar in concept, animation and play style to another popular kids game (see my boats review.) I'm unsure who copied who but the differences are purely cosmetic. I've had issues with this and the boats game regularly, once new content releases it asks you to pay more money to unlock \"all\" content. Feels scammy although the game itself is very cute and engaging.",
      "This is really a funny game! My children really enjoy playing with it. Sounds and pictures are funny and they laugh with raccoon's while he is racing and capturing stars. They love the chance of changing colors and each one choose his favourite color, tires and stickers. Even the older one, who is not a toddler, enjoys designing the cars and running. For us, it's really a 5 stars!!!",
      "This game allows child to create their own car and place it in a race. Good game for 3+ years old and especially if they like cars.",
      "It's a fun and creative and colorful game I just wish you could at least get two levels without having to pay.",
      "Great for toddlers! Fun, easy to use!"
