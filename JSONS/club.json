      "Yes, I know that it is a game that is not really that fun, but you know it gives you something to do and it makes you pay ALOT of attention! If you got the job it would probably be more boring in real life, so this game makes a very funnier and better version of this. So, just tell me that it is bad cause I will catch you lying!",
      "This is a terrible game. Yes, some people might findit entertaining, but seriously? It's not fun, you need to watch a billion ads every second and yes, it's not pay to win, it is very annoying to always have to watch an ad every time you are supposed to work. I would NOT reccomend this to you.",
      "The idea if it is fun. However, every lineup is extremely similar. It's usually let people in witch a certain color of shirt, 21+, and sober. I would have a lot more fun if it was harder. There's no brain work. A literal 4 year old could do this. Also, there are way too many ads! Like, I get it. It's necessary for most games to have ads but the average in this game is 3 ads every 1.5 minutes! It's exhausting! But seriously, make it harder and less ads and I would've kept this game on my phone...",
      "I love this game a lot and its fun to play when ur board... BUT the only thing i hate is when i press to get my money ot wont let me and sometimes i have to restart the whole thing, but in the bright side is that it will let me swipe then it will make it like give me my money yo 😂😂🤡🤡 I love the game so much and its so fun to play when your boared (I DONT KNOW IF I SPELT THAT RIGHT SO DONT TAKE IT SOMEWHERE TO A NOTHER LEVEL IN OUTER SPACE) Lol thanks for reading till the end and yeahhhhhhh!",
      "Pretty bad app. Design quite simple. I don't like the way it's shoves ads in your face. And to except a bribe you have to pay money? It's a sad excuse of a game. Tedious gameplay. 1 star would highly discourage you play."

      "It's an ok app. Sam stopped talking to me when I login and has gone to just posting everything as text messages. Also SAM isn't very good at understanding anything when you try to ask a question. Only thing I like is the ease of collecting rewards for completing challenges",
      "So far so good, but one of the major feature that I want to use, currently does not work! I'm talking about the friends list not being accessible. I'm able to send friend request to suggested friends from PlayStation Network, but beyond that I'm unable to access my Ubisoft friend list, normative anything else really.(under friends section) Resolve this, and concentrate on adding some more features...n this could easily be at 5 star app/companion! 🔨🤔🌐🗒️🖥️... 🤞🏻... 🤯👍🏻❗",
      "After the update, \"Sam\" stopped working after the update, friends list won't even load and it's not taking my progress in the game accurately. This could easily be highly rated. But, the update made is worse off.",
      "Great App! I love the gun skins that come with R6S and the renown I earn from completing challenges. I'd like to see more reward points offered frorn completing harder tasks or tasks that take longer to complete.",
      "App was working fine until i have updated it today then the app won't launch anymore with the message : \"Unfortunatly, ubisoft club has stopped.\" Tried solutions : clear cache ; clear data ; uninstall then install."

      "It's an ok game but its fixed. When playing vs computer mode I can predict what number on the dice will come up and all of the time I'm right which to makes it an unfair game. Now I'm not saying I expect to win every game because I know it's not about winning but I think it needs to change to make it more fair. Apart from that it's a great game to pass on the time l.",
      "Die is unfair . The outcome is predecided (not known buy user), it will let you win in beginning more and more so u become addicted to this game and spend more time on app. Later it make you win sometime or sometime not. Its is designed in way to spend more time on ludo. no one lost the first match, not in this game but in other ludo games too. This is not good.",
      "This game is an absolute joke. I've played it for years now an it's just one big fix. I'm sick wasting my time building money to 50 thousand an not a hope can I win past this. I won once an never since. The game gives a certain player a win from the start of the game . Dice always rolls the exact number my opponent needs . I can read every game like a book. I'm deleting this game because it's not fairly played as much as I loved it I refuse to waste anymore time playing. Ridiculous to be honest",
      "Game is good and fun.However it needs improvement with chat options and playing with friends.Chat should be available maybe at the bottom of the screen and made in a way that it doesnt interfere with a game.Its frustrating you have to open it in a new window and that sentence break after few words.Also we should be able to play with friends with other people in clas.mode not just among friend list but world wide."

      "It gives me a big message about Coronavirus when I open the app, but it disappears before I can read it. It would be nice if the \"Restricted Items in Cart\" error message actually said which item(s) it had a problem with. \"You have one or more restricted items in your cart. Restricted items can only be purchased at a register. Please remove them if you would like to checkout using Scan & Go\" is a completely useless error message.",
      "It is an exceptional tool, and another reason to rate Sam's above other \"big box\" stores! They also have an associate wipe down the carriages before you take one. They are doing everything they can to make sure your experience during these trying times are safe! So if you use, \"Scan and Go,\" you are maximizing social distancing, and minimizing the danger of exposure.",
      "This app is great and convenient for Scan and Go features as well as for looking as items online. The only problem I have is that when I order items to be shipped, the app omits my apartment number from the delivery information when I use my saved home address (which includes the apartment number). This causes issues with getting deliveries and some items have been sent back to the warehouse. Please fix this so I can place orders more seamlessly!",
      "Before I wasn't, but now I'm experiencing a new issue. Why when I try to add a new card, why is the expiration date not giving me an option to select number 1 or manually input it? Every time I do, it automatically switch to number 11? This has been causing a lot of frustration. I love the no wait Express checkout this app offers. Until this is fix 2 stars it is.",
      "The app was working well before today, 5 stars. But when I used today, the app caused the phone to shutdown ( screen went black and the phone was unresponsive) with every item scan. Lines were long, so I continued restarting the phone after each item scan and could finish the checkout process. Hope they fix the instability issues."

I didn't even know that was possible.  ---  UPDATE: the developers contacted me almost immediately about an error on their part (tl;dr: a planned update for later this month was mistakenly entered as a planned update for this month last year, which then prompted users to update their app even as no update was yet available). That's super responsive customer service if I had ever seen it.",

      "All in this games are cool but we need more design like person coming to the club look so robot 😅 and dance floor is small amount of design. At outside the club u can build anything make it look a life. Example vip people coming with sport car and building around the club look nice and amazing view. If u update like that u can get more people play ur game. That time i will give u 5star for that update and more people support u we hope u can help us.",
      "The games is a good game to play just like the restaurant and bakery the only difference is it has no goals to make it more interesting and it doesn't get anything new in it. This game hasn't been updated since July 28, 2014 why is that? Ya'll developers need to get off your butts and do better with this game. It didn't used to be like when it first came out and it shouldn't be like this now. Make updates just like you do with all your other games which I also play.",
      "Good game but hate that ill save up thousands and thousands of coins and literally watch them deplete without buying or doing anything. This needs to be fixed. I shouldnt drop from 56,000 coins to 23,000 coins without buying anything. The game literally robs you of coins.",
      "Iv played night club city (facebook's game). Actually i hope this game inspired from that game . And fyi, they got bonzer, booster for music, dj, bar tender. I hope u can develop this game more better than night club city",
      "I love this game. I've always dreamt of owning my own club! My favorite part of the game is that you get to play music from your own library. I dont know if it's the fact that when the people walk in they smile because theres drinks or if they like my personal library music. I guess I'll be wondering that for awhile. :) Good work developers!!! ❤😊😊😊"

You get special collection sets you can collect and huge rewards for completing any set unlike other bingo games that only give you such a small reward that it doesn't even feel worth completing the sets! I 100% recommend to everyone!",
      "I like the Bingo game but I think you should offer more power ups when you win the side games.. Power ups help win the games but you don't have a way to get them other than leveling up or winning 1 or 2 here & there.. Otherwise I like it so far.. Thanks",
      "The game is really cool , it's in my top 10. but I give it 4 stars because it's makes the game that much more fun when u can add lil personalization to it, for example : Add bingo daubers, change of voice of the caller, etc.not saying all of these but just to name a few.",
      "Best game I have played for this genre! Stunning graphics, wide selection of game themes, directional play, and multi-faceted elements to drive more competition and challenge. Just AWESOME!!!",
      "Very fun game. It's challenging but not impossible to achieve goals. The extra bonus things you win keep the game entertaining. I seem to do better overall in Bingo Journey but this is definitely a fav free bingo game!!"

Only very few check-ins count for the coupons, and if you do the wrong one while traveling, you can't check in again for hours. Used to always get the $2 and sometimes $3 coupons. Now i can't seem to get the $1 except at one station 10 miles from my home. I once rated this app 5 stars, then 3, now 1. I've been a loyal Citgo customer for years."

      "I logged into my Facebook and it won't load now, and my signal,Wi-Fi, and storage on my device are full bars and more than enough space so what is happening EDIT: I did some testing, and it is only the loading screen that tells you about the world map, and that is the loading screen for getting into the game on my device, so I need this to be fixed please, because it really is a good game and I would hate to stop playing it over one little glitch",
      "Awesome, but with issues. Here's the deal, this game is good! There are no useless mechanics like fuel, etc. But man, huge loading screens are everywhere! Also, there's too much texture tiling on the roads, and generally i think graphics needs improvement. I want to give 5 starts, and I'm ready to ignore the loading times, but graphics need to improve! Fix road texture please",
      "Fabulous game but some races really made me confused between two words 'easy' & 'medium'. E.g- I'm stuck in the firtile valley race. The recommended Pl is 184, my car have 204 (BMW Z4), race status says it's 'easy', but no matter how good I drive I always have the 2nd & 3rd pos. Same thing happens with my Ford focus (PI 218) can't even beat another focus (PI 204) in calm reaver race no matter how much & how efficiently I try. Control glitches are another major problem of this game. Needs work.",
      "Very bad gameplay :( Instead of player playing the game, the game is playing with player. Even fully upgraded still can't win, until the game decide to let you. Once you race an event, there's no same awards the second time you enter. Play and forgot, so no interest to collect cars and play again and again. One star for the stunning visuals, and one for the only one worthy to play future - the flash events.",
      "It won't even let me choose the controls, it gave me a Xbox controller as the default control but I don't have one. I can't even change the controls nor play the game because I can't find a way to change the control settings, whenever I go to control settings only the Xbox controller is showing, please fix. I use Xiaomi brand phones."

      "This app deducts points for absolutely no reason. I have no negative marks since I've been using it for months. All of a sudden, my score goes from 99 down to 94. This app seems like it's rigged in favor of AAA regardless of how good your driving is. I have no accidents or tickets. What's the deal? It also doesn't properly record round trips. If you have a good rate, I wouldn't download this app. They will probably try to use it against you to raise your rate somehow. What a scam. *Sigh* Smh.",
      "Worthless app as one can't login after repeated attempts (just like other raters report). It's been this way for a while. Even the counter personnel at my local AAA site acknowledge, when i queery them about the app, that it is a terrible app. I don't rate perform online ratings very often but i felt compelled to do this so other people don't waste time and phone space on this unusable app.",
      "This is probably the worst app I've ever downloaded. I can go to my computer and login just fine, but as soon as i go to the app on my phone, the exact same login will not work. I've reset the password 5x and still it won't recognize my login. Absolutely worthless app.",
      "App does what it's supposed, only problem for now it's the \"hard braking\", I read some answers and seems it count if you lose 20% of your speed in 1 sec. Their example was: \"40 mph and go down to 32 mph in 1 sec\". I'll recommend use the app on long trips, because in the city hard braking will be more often. They should have and option for that: If less than 35 mph and lose ±50% in less than 2 secs, anything below 40 mph should be more than 20% for being a hard braking. Just an opinion.",
      "Surprised this has as high of an average ranking as it does. I agree with all the other bad reviews. Love AAA, and this has not changed that, but I agree the hard breaking doesn't consider traffic patterns and defensive driving, and promotes running yellow lights. I was taking a road to & from work that had a speed limit of 45-50 that traffic goes 70 on, and which has stop lights throughout it. Impossible for me to stop and go responsibly without hard breaking. Shouldn't even try those yellows."

      "Ok after not playing several days on purpose to see if my gold coins I've earned were missing I can definitely tell you that they are taking away earned gold. I haven't put a penny in this game but I believe these kind of tactics are so people spend money. I have better things to do with my time. Pity, it's a fun game.",
      "Great game, very fun and addictive into the first 5 stages after that the game starts to become very inconsistent with the wind resistance, shots that should be made dosent always get made, which will cost you the game which is extremely frustrating. lots of ads can be watched for various things. (Please fix wind resistance inconsistency!!!!)",
      "Fun game.but you'll be watching so many advertisements you will get sick of seeing the same ones over and over. Also asks you to rate the game if you select less than 5 stars it opens your email instead I was so pissed I opened the play store just to give them the 2 stars they deserve 1 less than the 3 I was going to give in the app",
      "Good and challenging game. Complaining are those who cant even shoot properly",
      "Yeah pretty good, interesting skill sets from each individual. Besides the ads which come with every game app. It's enjoyable for sure."

      "This is a wonderful game,but I have 3 problems, first of all the diamonds is not enough I mean that if there is a good option it have diamonds, second, there is not enough tea I mean that if there was an important part of the story I used all of the tea, and the last thing that I am going to play the next part said to me (in development), but except that I like it very much, Oh! Another thing, I like moonborn and suduced by the rythem they are the most lovely stories to my heart, Thank you",
      "This game is amazing. They have great story plot, many love interests, and realistic illustration. They also give you diamonds pretty generously and pretty reasonable cup of tea(tickets to play). What prevents me from rating 5 stars is, sometimes i pick options consistently that would lead me to one love interest and yet it keeps saying 'my relationship is not close enough w them' which would totally change the story plot(sometimes between life and death). Thats so frustating. Please fix it🙏🏽",
      "Storries are good. Some of them capture your attention that you can't let go of it. It takes a lot of time to get new episodes when a story is in development. Two of the stories that I started, had to wait more than a month to get only two episodes and now need to wait again. But botttom line it is a good app.",
      "I'm stuck at 46.88% in the first time loading screen Seduced By Rhythm ! This app needs to improve ! Characters, Environment & sometimes Background Musics are so Realistic that I feel myself present in the stories of this app ! & obviously stories are so interesting but there're just Few Stories available now ! You guys must bring more stories fast ! U guys need to work faster !",
      "I wasn't expecting that this kind of games could be so exciting. Most of the stories are well written, characters are pretty realistic, and your choices do matter. The horror stories could evolve into a serious movies, that's for sure! Good job! And thanks for not robbing players by putting too little free opportunities."

      "The 1 game that has a conscious! I am a daily player of 4 games and I truly enjoy this one. I have been playing it for almost a year and I have only had to make 1 purchase. I have noticed since Covid-19 hit that Jackpot Casino, Bingo Blitz and the other game I play have suddenly let me lose all credit/coins but Club Vegas is a shining light! I am still playing as always and I think that they deserve for the world to know that they aren't taking advantage of this situation.",
      "Was having a good time until........ as you play pop-ups occure to encourage DL more games. At this point it's great game. but then CluBillion was next on Gplay and this interfered and cont. locked up. I tried a xtimes 2 resolve the sit closing the app starting it up. This was the 1st time I had any issue with GPS coming up for new game. But It was okay cus free, but for $ cust, might cause an issue. But absolutely the dinamite slot way cool my fav.",
      "This game used to be fun! Since the latest update it keeps glitching and stops in the middle of games. I messaged them and they pretty blamed me for the issues. Said to uninstall the app and reinstall, check android version.. etc. They must not think I'm the brightest because all of those things were done before I even contacted them. Apparently per the other reviews it's not just me this is happening to. So... STOP blaming your players and fix YOUR app!",
      "How do you know when you've downloaded a good app? When you have played it for years (since its inception in 2017) and STILL have as much fun each time, as the very first! This Slot App is NOT like all the rest... and yes, I think it IS the best! ;D My #1 FAVORITE out of the 4 I daily play! :D TY",
      "Update; they just changed the Chat settings & their. It's easier to play, alert team, go global They really have a Vast vei more ppl, if anything for Gold Members! I can't friend all of my team,plus friends! I hate unfriending ppl daily!Unlike other places where I feel like the , ' U MUST Buy!' signs are unending. They haven't been unintrusive or assulting! Believe it or not I was able to play for quite awhile on a little at 1st.. They are plenty of games, even some not on other sites!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️"

Overall a very poor interface and experience, but the app is otherwise functional.",
      "So the scanning has been added, yay But it's also kinda time consuming to look through the coupons while shopping. And doing it before hand does help, but then you risk missing some. If maybe there was a way to have your fav brands already selected or marked so we dont have to clip the same coupons each time. Itll save time and at the same time I can look for new coupons",
      "Edited: Customer care was great. Problem with the app getting confused with old and new emails. They worked it out. App still has some quirks. Scanned an item several times and entered the bar code several times. App said item not found. Scanned it again and it finally worked. No idea why....The express pay was great though. Lines to the back of the store and I paid in the app and walked right out!",
      "I have the same issue with the app as others that have the app open by itself when first unlocking my phone. It happens randomly throughout the day and it's very annoying. I like the app for adding coupons but if you don't fix this I will also be uninstalling the app. This issue was resolved a long time ago. The app works great now.",

      "I've never been much of a gamer mainly due to the repetativeness and just easily loss of interests? However this game with its awesome graphics and just being able to make it my own has got me completely addictive!",
      "This was a great game for the most part. Great cars races are cool . Just needs body kits and rims. But i just beat the last guy before i got to Global races. Now you can't do anything in the global races unless you have them cool cars. And its not a lot of gold bar to earn unless you buy them. Should give us more then 10 after level 20. But other than that its cool a game.",
      "Have installed and uninstalled game multiple times. Game loads shows logo, logs into my google play then screen goes black. Waited 10mins with black screen nothing ever happens.",
      "It sucks!! It disen't even open. Loads into Google Play and then goes to a black screen."

I use it for my children because that's what their sports clubs have chosen and the basics are in place, but: • It's really slow to load • Once the app has loaded, further levels still take ages • The user interface is clunky at best • The graphics / UI clash • Options previously submitted aren't displayed, rather a blank set • I could go on Conclusion: Idea good, execution had",
      "Not a great app. Better than managing teams via email and WhatsApp but only just. Incredibly slow to open, with some really frustrating aspects such as not showing recent messages (I can see the updates on the email notification but not in that app).",
      "Why can see all the names for a Game Fixture selected and for an event but where people want to see who is coming publicly for training attendees this is forced to be hidden with no options to allow team to see the list like it would for a published game. It means cluttered match fixtures with tramping fixtures so admin can then allow people to see so much more use is admin sets oubkic or private list view if training dates"

      "It is a ok app to learn, but the constant lagging and crashing does get intolerable. I paid to buy every pack, and i can tell you that the prices can get steep, and when you click the pronounce button, it almost never works. Only 14/15 words per pack even seem to work. NOT COOL SCRIPPS. Make the pronunciation button actually usable or I will not be using this next year or buying any products. NOT RECOMMENDED!!",
      "I almost didn't purchase the app because of the negative reviews, but we decided to give it a try anyway. It works great! By far the best way we've found for my daughter to study for the spelling bee. We purchased an the word sets, and each set includes definitions, language of origin, pronunciation, and the word used in a sentence, as well as multiple ways to study and practice.",
      "I came here to access the school lists, no luck. Interface is very confusing. I wish Scripps would stick to the computer version, and not completely terminate it and replace it with an app. And if you get this app, you have to spend $25 to unlock all word packs, if you want to not spend much, I would recommend looking at old word lists. For new spellers though, have $25 ready.👎",
      "This is a great app! I bought the $25 pack, wondering if it would be worth it, and it really is! I don't have to doubt pronunciations because Dr. Jacques Bailly is pronouncing them. I have all the resources: definition, language of origin, and part of speech. Yay! One thing I would recommend is for the pronunciations to automatically play once you get to the next word. I feel like that would save time, and if you didnt hear it the first time, you can click the button. Thanks again for this app!❤",
      "Didn't have any problem till now. Just that would have been better if the pronunciation was not showing for every word. It is quite distracting. It should have been on demand like the other features."

      "Great BUT... What is the point of continuing to play if eventually I can't win anymore? Like, ever. I'm at level 18 and now when I play, all the other players can lay an initial hand WAY before I can, and I only have maybe, 2 turns to try and win. What the heck? Now it's no fun because it's TOO hard. Why play anymore.",
      "Once you start high rolling and betting 1m+ the game keep you from melding until you have 20 or more tiles. The NPCs end up playing out before you can even play a tile. I have played Rummikub for 30 years and I have seen a 25 tile hand less than ten times. In two days I've had 10. Pay-to-play garbage. EDIT: I'm not updating my review score. You can sit with a single-star rating from me. I played the game some more to see if the odds were stacked against me. Lo-and-behold! If, in any \"city\" that you play in, you bet more than half of the maximum possible bet it is 62% less likely that you win and that you will be dealt with tiles that prevent you from melding for the first 5-10 turns. I will reiterate. Pay-to-play garbage. The game is designed to punish people who \"bet big\" and go for it, attempting to coerce them into buying more chips to continue playing. The starting bet is always over the halfway mark (in Dubai, for example, the auto-bet is 2.6 million where the maximum is 5 million).",
      "Fun, until you get to higher levels. Then to keep you from progressing you end up drawing and waiting to pull tiles enough to play, watching the other players play out after you finally get top lay your starter hand. About to delete, just annoying. You're playing against a computer, give me a break!",
      "Looooong ads. Good game, but it seems to go through long cycles where I am very often the last player on the board, If I get on at all. Or I finally get in the game, but then it ends before I get a turn... This gets really BORING. Tap, wait, tap wait, tap, wait, tap, wait, tap, wait, tap, wait, tap, wait...... Sigh 😞 My win rate is 57% and I am working my way up to 5 billion coins. Yes, billion! I have played 847 games.",
      "I used to play this as a board game when I was younger and i loved it. I was so pleased when i found it on line. But it is frustrating when they want me to pay real money for stupid chips, I wont do that!"

      "Fantastic content, but terrible app. It's just has so many bugs. Biggest issues at the moment is the app won't let me un-save a workout, meaning I can't pre-plan the weeks workouts. Also, if I go into my feed, down to the It's time to move post from yourselves, and click join now, I get a new home screen with tabs such as 'expert tips', but if I go anywhere else the app and come back to workouts, it reverts to the standard 4 tabs. Please help",
      "Beyond EXCEPTIONAL! We have been using this app off and on for the past 6 months or so and never wanted to pay for premium and during the COVID-19 pandemic they amazingly made premium available for free to everyone! It has been such an incredible relief to not only have a way to workout but to try new workouts and experience the premium membership during this time of uncertainty. I will always remember the considerate and supportive measures Nike took. Thank you!!!",
      "Uses to absolutely love this app, but recently has been EXTREMELY glitchy to the point where I can barely even use it at all out of frustration. Updating my workout plan doesn't work, or doesn't save and prompts me every single time I go into my weekly schedule. Also won't let me edit my week, also doesn't save my workouts/progress. I was 2 weeks into a plan and all the sudden it just disappeared and I had to start all over, the videos are out of sync. Won't be using until fixed!",
      "It's a great resource but the music thing is annoying. It does not recognize google play as my default music player and does not integrate my playlists... I can not play my music through the nike training club and thus miss built in features otherwise advertised...",
      "Always easy to follow instructions. Loving the premium content and the trainers. I love learning new moves and stretches and this app definitely teaches you that no matter your skill level."

Even max upgrade wont make you reach realistic top speed (stock vehicle's top speed in real life) You'll rarely find players online, hence you won't be able to get cases to upgrade your vehicle too.

      "This game gives more free stuff (coins, gems, cards) then any other game i have played. I played Clash Royale for two and a half years and the reason I quit was because they were too greedy and it was a Pay to Win game. It's definitely nice that you don't have to worry about that with this game you don't need to pay for nothing and you can still do good. Delete all of your pay to win games and get this. Come see me i will beat you.",
      "This is the first time it's ever happened to me and I did report it As a cheat for there can't be no other reason😢 there's a reason why playing Shanghai I'm ahead I end up losing right after I shoot triple and sevens so apparently I had more than 7 right and it quickly and the game that puts me at 4 and the winner had 217 how is that even happen? I don't think it was the game it was someone that has the equipment to do that there's no way 4 -217 game didn't finish DECLARED HIM WINNER NO W",
      "I am changing my review due to the devs fantastic job in dealing with balance in certain game modes. This game is awesome, free of ads, only when you do want to watch an ad. I now suggest to add a feature where you could see the each dart part potential quality if fully upgraded, so I can see which part is worth upgrading. Thanks a lot!",
      "Pretty fun once they increase skill shot and spins to 4 as was harder to earn gems to do challenges and other features now it rocks. Could be better to drop needed parts missing 1 and having to play area over and over cause I am OCD like to have complete sets before moving on. So need to work on algorithm to give needed parts imo. But other than that really fun.",
      "Disappointing game, not because of the play but the players. Never experienced such a large collection of rude and disrespectful people. Cheating seems to be evident. Though who knows, nonetheless I often turn it off because of opponent's behavior."

      "This game is frustrating and highly addictive in equal measures. Having started with League 2 Cambridge, I got them into a Champions League spot and won the Europa League in 12 seasons and am in the top 10 in the Premier League consistently. The frustrating bit: unless I've missed something, I have to pay cash for UEFA badges, to enable me to get a bigger job...or reach a reputation of Level 95 to get it free. Even by winning the Europa League and a League Cup with lowly Cambridge, I still only have a reputation of about 78! Paying you cash for progression and success (ironically for football) seems wrong.",
      "The game is great, yes. But would be better with a few fixes. No way I'll working my ass off to get the funds needed for efficient running of the club, only for it to disappear be given peanuts at the start of each and every season. It's annoying, cause no way I'm spending on this game, I'd rather download a cracked version if this isn't checked in the next update/version, tick tock lol. Try making the game more realistic as we the gamers, expect.",
      "Okay. The game has huge potential, it's really fun and I'm into it, but it has huge issues. The biggest issue is that it's pay to win. I played couple of seasons in different clubs and not once have I acomplished club goals!Not even to avoid regulation. The game is totally making you lose, no matter how hard you are investing and playing smart, you just lose unless you pay for boosts, which stops you from working in better clubs. When this issue is fixed, when game is balanced.",
      "Here is suggestion from me for players that having a hard time playing this game. Try using a lower tier club, set the playing style to your favorite, sign a free player with higher rate than your squad and staff with the same playing style ASAP, get rid any player that doesn't suit your playstyle or you can sell them to free the wage budget and get cash, spend any available fund for upgrade stadium facility. I've been using Aldershot, playing 4 season until now and get promoted every year 😊",
      "I like this game but it's needs serious attention and wisdom now I started season with Barcelona I won more than 40 La Liga league,Copa del Rey more than 20 times,More than 20 champions league and 1 Euro cup with Barcelona to be honest Premier league is more difficult league because any team can win league ,I spent 3 years in Premier ,I became Premier league runners up twice and I won Premier league once and league cup once,now I'm on year 2064,I have UEFA A certificate I haven't spent any money"

    "description":"FREE Domino Club app lets you play domino online on Android phones and tables with hundreds of real domino players using a central internet domino server at GameClubUSA.com. Play dominoes, chat, compete and improve your skills and rating!\r\n\r\nPlay Domino app offers 3 versions of online dominoes:\r\n1. Five-up (also referred to as Muggins or All Fives)\r\n2. Draw (or open variation)\r\n3. Block (or closed variation)\r\n\r\nDominoes is a 2-player game of skill using 28 dominos where each player gets 7 or 9 dominos at start.\r\nThe goal in dominos is to be the first to get the agreed-upon number of points (100 - 500).\r\n\r\nFive-Up Variation\r\nIn Five-Up, points are scored during the play\r\nby making the exposed ends of the domino chain total to a multiple of five. \r\nThe winner at the end of each hand also scores points for all the pips remaining in the other player's hand. Players can select 7-bone or 9-bone hand variations.\r\nAt the beginning of a dominoes game, the hands are dealt by random shuffling of tiles and distributing 7 or 9 tiles (also called bones or dominoes) to each player.\r\nThe remaining dominoes are placed in the boneyard to be drawn from by a player when a tile cannot be played from his hand. If this is the first hand of a game, the player with double six must play it first (also see options below - random 1st hand). If no one has the double six, the call goes out for double five, then double four, and so on until one of the players can produce the called for tile. Players then take turns. In subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand starts the next game.\r\nThe first player to use all of own tiles wins the hand in a game. Once the winning piece is placed on the chain, the hand is over and the players expose their remaining pieces to be counted in the scoring. No further plays can be made by any of the players. It is possible for the game to reach a dead end, where all play is blocked and no tiles may be played. This outcome is called a blocked or jammed game.\r\nIf a player does not have any tiles which have a number of pips that matches one of the exposed ends of the chain, that player must draw from the boneyard one tile at a time until he/she draws one which may be played.\r\n\r\nDraw Variation \r\nAs opposed to Five-Up variation above, points are not awarded during play for making multiples of five. Points are awarded only at the end of each hand.\r\nEach player tries to match the pips on one end of a tile from his/her hand with the pips on an open end of any tile in the chain. If a player is unable to match a tile from his/her hand with a tile in the chain, the player passes his/her turn. Each player may play only one tile per turn. If a player cannot match a tile with one in the chain, he/she must draw from the boneyard until the tile that can be played is drawn. If there are no tiles left in the boneyard, the player passes his/her turn. The first player to get rid of all dominoes wins the hand. If none of the players can make a play, the game ends in a block. If a hand ends in a block, the players turn the tiles in their hands face-up for counting. The player with the lowest total wins the hand and earns the points (1 point per pip) of all the tiles left remaining in his opponent's hand. The player who first reaches the agreed-upon number of points (100-500) or more is the overall winner.\r\n\r\nBlock Variation\r\nThis is similar to Draw variation above, except no player can draw from a boneyard. If none of the players can make a play, the hand ends in a block. The players turn the tiles in their hands face-up for counting. The player with the lowest total wins the hand and earns the points (1 point per pip) of all the tiles left remaining in his opponent's hand. The player who first reaches the final number of points (100-500) or more is the overall winner.\r\nAs this is an internet domino game, Internet connection is required. WIFI connection is not necessary - will play well with 3G connection. Domino Club automatically reconnects if connection is lost.",

      "Four star rating from me not because I'm not enjoying the since I love the game.The boring thing is despite me being profitable in a team the board still reduces the wage budgets every season even after I use my hard earned coins to invest in the club which brings me back to square one with a wage budget deficit of about 1mil bucks.Another negative aspect of the game is when the board reduces the available funds with 28mil to increase the available funds with a mere 50k.Is that even realistic?",
      "Very bad game. I am not happy with the fact that you have to spend real money to upgrade your coaching badge. I played 25 matches and won just 2, no money to buy professional players. Very bad game by all standard.",
      "After playing 14 seasons on this came it soon became evident that you would love it at the beginning but it will become virtually impossible to manage clubs as the wages of players become so unbelievably high that it makes it so difficult practically impossible to be able to build a squad with any depth at all if the game was to bring in unbelievably high budgets then it will be okay but the budgets stay normal and the board never seem to invest funds overall a good game but needs improvements",
      "Very gud manager game that is offline,, I don't rregret downloading it, but the owner have abandoned the game they haven't upgrade it for more than two years pls work on that",
      "The game as a whole is awesome and addictive and I probably would have rated it 5 stars, if not for a few issues. It does not automatically adjust resolution; so there are things I can't see on the screen. Some times when trying to watch an ad and the game becomes unresponsive. Which really sucks if you hadn't saved the actions you just performed. Besides that the game is awesome and addictive."

    "description":"Club communications are simple with Clubforce.

      "I love this! You can easily add anything and keep track of your characters. The one thing I hate is that when you accidently delete something, theres no \"Are you sure\" message before hand. I learned this the hard way after deleting a class that took my 1 week to do. Add that, and this'll be perfect",
      "its an amazing supplement to the book, but the app is lacking in a lot of class traits and stuff. for instance, it only has the invocation path for wizards. otherwise, its really good for tracking stats and inventory and limited use abilities and has a dice roller built in",
      "Untill recent, it's been great. But thanks to the new update, I can't create a character because it won't let me roll gold or choose equipment. Please fix soon",
      "Nice app. it is quite similar to Squire. The initial character setup is quite OK, once you get the hang of it. I really like the fact that it works in landscape on my tablet. My wish list (in order priority) * please add descriptions to the conditions! * when you throw a weapon, it should not be in your inventory anymore. * it would be nice to have to choose a slot when I roll for a spell. Now I have to manually expand a slot in a different location on the page, and I sometimes forget this. * some conditions could be triggered automatically (e.g., prone in case of unconsious).",
      "One of the best character sheets on the market. It does a great job of integrating numbers from different sets. (bg, class, race profs and stats) I find the inventory to be a little clunky (moving item from disguise Kit to backpack; why not just put thing in the backpack that you eqiup? Difficult to navigate until you get used to it. Still a really fresh app for keeping characters digitally. I use it a lot. This and squire pro are the best IMO."

      "I have tried everything to access my account. I have re-installed the app, changed passwords. I kept getting an \"app failed\" response when trying to login. Re-installed multiple times. Tried changing my password using my laptop bc nothing worked on the app. Still can't sign in on the app using new password. Can't start a new account with my email address. It's just a dead end trying to use this app. I want access to my Pampers reward points and I can't use them if the app is not functional.",
      "The app won't send a message to verify my phone. Never set it up under a different phone number so it shouldn't be a problem. Uninstalled it and restated phone, still won't send the message. Can't use an app that won't do what it says it will do. This is the worst app I've ever tried to install.",
      "In the beginning I love the app but then when I got a new phone and new number I was unable to log into the app from you the new phone it kept sending the code to the old number and it would ask is this the right number but don't give you the option to say no or it give you the option for the code to be sent to an email so I haven't been able to use the app in about a month.",
      "Changed phones and now the camera has successfully read a barcode one time, not a huge deal but I wish it was a little better, like actually works. I use the same phone for a few other apps that use the camera with zero issue. The notifications are useless. Now I know people are like \"well Dan, just turn off your notifications\" I would except I have them to catch deals and I get notifications that contradict each other on a regular basis!",
      "Easy to use. Great design. And I absolutely LOVE the notifications of positive love and support for parents. On weeks I have a baby screaming because he is growing, or missing his dad, or teething, they give me joy and remind me that I am doing the best I can do and that is what counts. I just wish they sent out more of them."

      "Great! Makes it easy to schedule and plan up to 15 visits ahead. I have it 4 stars because I wish the waitlist would not take up one of those 15 slots. I also think it would be great if the class you registered for would get highlighted under the FIND A CLASS section because going back and forth between MY SCHEDULE and FIND A CLASS is annoying. Overall these are smsll things. The app is easy to figure out and works well.",
      "Well organized. Choosing classes: easy to request list by instructor or level/type of class. Can see my own bookings on one page. Will add my classes to my Google calendar if I ask. Know when I have selected all the classes my membership allows in that time frame (very helpful if membership is a certain number per pay period).",
      "Easy to book classes and view schedule on one page. Visibility into waitlist position is great, but it needs to send a push notification to text if you get booked in last minute. Does not track classes automatically, which would make it a 5 star app.",
      "Excellent app. Simple to use with many features, e.g., signing up for classes, seeing your schedule, recording & analyzing your workouts, and more.",
      "This is a nice app that does exactly what you need. Check schedule, available credits, and book or cancel classes from your phone, smoothly and efficiently."

      "I love this app and have been using it for YEARS. I have a very irregular cycle and this app makes tracking it (and all the symptoms that go with it) a piece of cake. Thanks for helping my doctor visits be more productive, and for helping me to find patterns in my skin clarity and mood swings! Also I love that the Pro version isn't crazy expensive. I barely even feel the $1/month and the benefits are well worth the cost!",
      "Used this app for YEARS and has never failed me except for lately. There's no option for my method of birth control (arm implant) and it has thrown off my cycle predictions and analysis. Also, in the last few updates, I've been unable to add my own tags. Please fix this, I love this app and the work put into it so much I don't want to switch to another.",
      "Clue's timing is very on point for me. I do wish it offered more customization outside of adding tags. Examples: 1- I had my tubes removed, so I ovulate, but am not exactly fertile. It'd be nice to be able to turn off the \"fertile window\" when all I want is an approximate ovulation date. 2- I do yoga and bike, but I don't run or swim; wish I could replace those buttons with exercise I *do* engage in.",
      "I've been using this app for about 5 years to keep track of my period, as well as when PMS is gonna hit. I've even used it to track if I've taken my birth control. This app also provides educational information about not just periods, but menstrual cycles overall so it's perfect for anyone who may not know a lot about their cycle. It's also very inclusive of trans & nonbinary people as well. I 100% reccomend this app to anyone who menstruates. Keep up the good work guys!❤",
      "After using a website tracker for 12 years I finally switched over to an app. After extensive research I settled on Clue for ease of use, readability, and complete coverage of symptoms. I loaded about a year's worth of back data and received decently accurate predictions. I am very happy with my choice and will support the developers as soon as I am able."

      "It's ok I guess, but unless you want to pay $1 for every other gun you dont get for free(and there are very little guns you get for free considering all the others) you get bored too fast because you run out of things to do so you either just keep repeating the same things on the same gun, or you end up like me, just deleting it all together. Creators of the game, if you are going to charge $1 for every other gun you need to give people more guns for free and more things to do with the guns.",
      "Brilliant simulator! Lots of fun! I would like to add that it would be nice if each individual weapon had separate loadouts and setups. Like with different camos and attachments to give the player more options for customization. Great game nonetheless!",
      "Models are good, same goes with the ammunition boxes. The reason I give this a 3 star is because the reflective lighting cannot be fixed so you're gun is just dead. Another reason is because on a shotgun, you have to put in the shells, and that makes my camera view yank to the bottom of the gun. Overall, the game is pretty good. I would recommend it for people who like reflective lighting. That's the end of this report.",
      "This game is amazing but there is one problem you can only use the guns that are given to you or you can get for free like the fg 42 it would be great if you can do achievements to get the currency for the guns that need real money to get and it would also be great if we could move freely instead of the isolated range or survival like the zombie event on the range but with waves and wave of zombies while trying to keep your health bar the highest it can be",

I have not availed any facility of country club/vacation and i dont have proper guidance to use it as well.  I used to get calls only for AMC or payment.. where is other interactions and offers or to motivate members to continue with membership..  Really bad to look Coutry club as only following up for payment other than anything..",
      "Country club has really a very worst hotel in all over india and services is more worst then a normal dhaba bala...request to all the people in Indian never ever join country club and be member of it...booking never get confirmed after booking it 20 days or a month ago...u have to get the confirmation after calling them 1000 times. Pls guys dont ever be part of country club...I rate them for worst 1000 out of 1000....I hv rated 1 star because if not select then not allowed to post the review",
      "Fake promises and Fake people ... I taken a membership & sales people told that you will get cards and login with in 7-10days. With in the this time frame they added my details as fake No. and fake mail ID and they didn't send any purchase details as well. I was waited till 10days and asked them to return my money they told that you can sell your product after 1year. But that was also miss leading the customer. More over my signature has been used without my permission.. don't believe ...all...",
      "Worst app and service. Do not get a membership from this club. No guidance no customer care service, no online service. Ridiculous management. I am a platinum member. Trying to reach customer service For days now. Not picking up calls, app doesn't work, online login doesn't work. And clubs are also not worth.",
      "They don't give you premium hotels even if available. They will give you hotels without elevator facilities, rooms that are not furnished etc etc. I had experienced that on foreign trip. They charge alot. Even hotels were not 5 star or above as committed."

      "Love Trunk Club! The stylists are quick to reply & answer questions. Seem to get my Style right away & suggest great things that. I might not have tried when shopping for myself.",
      "The app is okay. One improvement I would make is to include the information of things that were returned just in case I would like to purchase the items in the future. Also a link to the Nordstrom website would be helpful. As @BiancaRodriguez pointed out, the Stylists do not seem to take note of customer likes and dislikes. The Stylists don't seem to read the notes and view the links available to them with information about the customer. The trunks are packaged beautifully. However, there is not an option for exchange of items (for size) and if there are other colors/patterns available for purchase. One good thing is that they don't push trendy items, but one of the reasons I am trying this service is to get me out of my normal and to try something new. I am finding that I prefer the \"surprise\" element from the other personal shopping service; they also seem to take my preferences into consideration.",
      "The clothes are fine and the stylist is nice. The fact I can schedule on my own terms is amazing. They need more interaction with the clothes. They show all these outfits on the home screen and I have no way to say what I like and don't like. I feel like its really difficult to get my style into their system.",
      "The Trunk Club service itself is fantastic & I'm a very happy customer but this app needs a whole lot of work. It's very limited in what it can do vs. just logging on to the website. Fewer item details are available & I've even missed new services that Trunk Club added due to thinking the app was fully functional. Chat is the only thing that is more convenient but UI elements tend to jump around & chat notifications are spotty at best. I'll primarily use the website going forward.",
      "The mobile app sign-in doesn't work. It asks for your email address, then sends you a link to click through into the site, but the link takes you back to the page to submit your email address again. Please do not require me to check the box to add everyone in my contacts folder for this to work!"

      "Punch Club 2 when, oh wait 2020... Now it is 2019. I am fine with a game being delayed, but a delay without any type of communication feels wrong. Imagine a T.V. show doing the same thing. All of the sudden game of thrones falls off the radar. People wouldn't let that go.    Delaying a game without announcing is ruining the hype. You will simply lose a lot of money. I mean, you probably forgot about it since they’re working on that tycoon game, but still.....",

It seems like almost all games published under Tinybuilds name is fun, I just beat Streets of Rogue a couple of hours ago and went to see if they had mobile games because it's one of my most favorite games and I know this isn't really about the game im reviewing right now but Dang! You make some great games also I loved snail bob used to play it when I was 6 on my moms laptop really guys if you guys have a patreon please tell me where to donate keep it up Tinybuild devs you people need some peoples choice rewards or freakin noble peace prize already how have you people not gotten one...",

      "Very poor. Not as interactive as advertised. And not as realistic as advertised. When your slide locks back after emptying a clip in any weapon, and you discharge your empty mag and load a new mag in and release the slide with the button or pull back, IT SHOULD CHAMBER IN A ROUND. You gotta press a button to shoot, and everything is set to a certain selection. I choose select fire between 1.Safety 2.burst 3. Automatic, I wanna put on safety from burst, gotta go through auto. Realistically unsafe",
      "The only thing that I really like about this app is the variety of weapons, especially the artillery. However the controls for many of the weapons are either too sensitive or too insensitive. For example the f1 grenade to my knowledge doesn't work at all and the app doesn't offer help for the grenade either. And the graphics lag far behind other gun apps.",

I mean this game was good but now I have only 15 guns or I pay 20$ again and for that much i can just get a game on Xbox. I loved the game but now it sucks. To bad. Do not buy if thinking to uninstall or just dont uninstall",
      "Randomly freezes on the loading screen, meaning i have to uninstal the app a few times. Also it dosent save what you buy and you cant retrieve them. Waste of 3 dollars."

They have like 5 events and repeatrd it for like more than a year. The rewards from the events are also a joke, nothing really excite you to get after first few compishments. It's a Gacha game that you cant spend on anything for a month due to the banner last too freaken long time. Sega, fire this team or close",

Ads are short, if u want to pay that's fine as well. I'd definitely recommend this game for the rapid soccer or footy fan. 5 stars ladies and gents.",
      "Pretty good game. Takes things slow and steady. Hoping for better drop rates or more events to get better managers. 3 out of 4 of my unlocked clubs are stuck with not so great managers.",
      "A very nice game but certain issues are therelike now im a 75ovr but always my match is fixed with 81 or 82 rated teams with 99 chem and i always lose the match and my scout is asking me to pay 2900 for just one 87 rated player what the heck please bring these down to reasonable prices like atleast 2100 is enough to buy a superstar so please see to it but othrwise its a fantastic enjoyable game",
      "Everything is great but I think that the players should be able to recover stamina over time and not just stamina boosters. That would change my rating to a 5",
      "The game makes it very hard to get good players or managers. Even worse, i keep losing matches and i am not sure what went wrong considering that i frequently tune my tactics, my team is pretty strong and my chemistry is always in the high 90s. I think this game could be far better if there is a more in dept analysis on matches such as what went wrong and what tactics could have been better for the next match. Lastly, please make it easier for players to get better players and managers."

And i was expecting a big surprise... NO... the app after I updated my card says that I never had any purchase history. And treated me as a new member... The question is what happened to all these card swipes at Al shaya stores... I have spent hundreds if not over a thousand KD over the years..After that experience. Worthles.",

This is not what I was told in the store so please fix that problem or cancel the application if it is not working well.",

I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt the first time my information was erased after amassing points, but the second time? Customer service can't reset or even locate my account with my phone number, registered email, or Civ ID? Too much of a coincidence to have happened twice. Skip this personal data gathering app as it doesn't bring any value to you anyway.",

Being able to enter my non winning scratchers in their second chance drawing is cool too. The app is a little buggy sometimes like errors connecting to the online network and freezes. The overall app experience could best be described as a little rough around the edges and somewhat of a learning curve. I would recommend just using the website and save some space.",
