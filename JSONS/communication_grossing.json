And my chat list isn't loading. It happens to me every day and resetting end reinstalling isn't working. Fix this Facebook. It's annoying. 🙄 It started 3-4 weeks ago.",
      "Text works great. But when I call people it seems like the voice and video calls don't always work here in Cleburne TX. When I call people on the other side of the world it works fine but here in my town the calls don't always go through or get dropped or bad quality. Maybe the internet availability needs improvement in my town.",
      "Messenger recent update is bugged and I have tested it already on all 3 devices of mine, both android and iOS. Whenever I am trying to share something through messenger (be it a YouTube video, a photo, or an audio clip I have recorded in my phone's internal app), it will only pull up the Messenger app as if I am not sharing anything!!",
      "messenger sucks anymore.....have not been able to share and send articles to my friends as I did before, by clicking on share, then messenger and then name used to come up and I would click send next to their name, but will not and has not done for three going on four days today and do not know why! Is there something wrong with messenger? Can you please fix this problem and asap, thanks!"

    "comments":[
      "Doesn't deliver as advertised. First week of use, in trial period. All the robocalls tonight rang through and disturbed my peace. Only when I physically rejected a call did it go to the recorded answer. The caller was a collector I believe and he immediately got that it was a recording and disconnected the call so it did not fool anyone. When I tried to reach RoboKiller customer support thru the app, none of the links worked to do so. Very frustrating. [UPDATE] Has worked as advertised lately.",
      "Found that it did not recognize the calls that are actually bugging me (spoofed calls in mandarin). Was only able to block spoofed calls that was similar to my number where most are in the realm of 1-800... Etc. Cancelled after free trial. Only successfully blocked a call from my bank that I'm fairly sure was legitimate (to be confirmed). I liked that it transcribed voicemail messages, but like I said, most of them are in mandarin so... My visual assessment of the number was way more reliable.",
      "Works mostly as advertised. Surprised at the negative reviews here, haven't had trouble. Still, it doesn't waste as much scammer time as the marketing wants you to believe. I only get \"ring once\" or pre-recorded robocall scams that are \"press 1 to connect\" or make you call back a number. These aren't affected by the advertised \"hilarious\" Robokiller bots. Only the legit Dr's offices, uber drivers etc using non-whitelist numbers get the bots. I assume the real benefit is in the database.",
      "The app doesn't really work. I still get just as many spam calls as I did since I got it. What sucks is that the fix is to add a spam call to the list, but its just like me blocking the number only difference is now. They change the numbers like they always fo and the call still goes through. Im letting this month chatge after that Im uninstalling it",
      "Phone does ring twice then the app will pick up. There are a lot of answer bots to pick from. After the call is done you can listen to the phone cell. The app also stores your voice mails from your contacts."

      "Won't let you try it without your payment information and an automatic $5/month subscription after 7days. Don't download unless you're willing to submit your payment information. Now they have my real number which they'll probably sell to scammers and telemarketers. Wish they would have disclose those details before making me give up my number. Not cool.",
      "All burner numbers I used to have worked for SMS and other verification services that allowed to stay anonymous for personal reasons be it safety or otherwise. Now not a single number can be used for the original intent, use, and functionality. Will be looking for a better service that allows for the full use of numbers as originally able to do. At the current usefulness of the app it's nothing more than an expensive quickly thrown out number that has zero usefulness unless you simply plan on ghosting people for dates or something else that's pretty lame.",
      "I love this app. After free trial it is still very affordable. It works perfect to keep up with people that your required to speak to a person via court order, but do not need them getting your regular phone number. It is able to change, therefore allowing you to not have unwanted spam calls and prank calls very often!",
      "was a good app. Paid auto renew for 3 lines on Googlle play store. Google says it renews Mar 3rd. Today is Feb 10. The app says subscription lapsed, expired. Guess they took my money and ran. Cant get a hold of their support either. Use to be a 5 star app. Now just a theif. Update: was not resolved. Uninstalled.",
      "Great app but taking one star because I wish you had a option like google voice to archive your messages for people you aren't actively having a conversation with. I love that feature. Update 3/22/20 would still love a archive feature on this app like you can with email or Google voice. Please please please add this feature."

      "Cancelled premium. I still get 3-5 spammers calling through every day from numbers labeled \"domestic line\" or something else. It's some health insurance scam that spoofs numbers. Then if I have a legit person calling and I try to answer the app text changes to \"dialing\" as if it's calling the caller back and that takes 10 or 15 seconds so by then the caller hangs up. The UI's buggy: keeps ringing even if I decline the call, the UI stays on top but stops responding, while the phone rings.",
      "Have to reduce my rating. Since I've installed this app, I think, but I'm not sure, that it is somehow jumbling phone numbers up when I'm called which prevents my phone from using saved ringtones for specific saved contacts. Not all contacts are affected but quite a few are.",
      "App needs to allow through initially so the user can know who's trying to contact. Also all it seems to do is not allow ANYTHING through initially...not even people in your phone's contact list. Just appears to keep the phone from ringing and will eventally weed out those who don't bother to respond to the text. Not worth it, deleted after less than a week.",
      "What a scam. I signed up for premium last year. This year, they automatically took the money out of my account, which wouldnt have been a problem, but now the premium wont work on my phone. It was working fine until they got paid. Clearly as you can see I am not the only one, and the app owner, DOESNT RESPOND TO ANY COMPLAINTS!!!!!!!! I am getting my money back !!!",
      "After this latest update every phone call pops up with \"Call ended - Unknown caller\", even calls to my contacts. ANOYNG Still cannot report spam. It's been months now. Says \"reporting available check your Internet connection\" even though I am on T-mobile network."

      "Good messaging app! I haven't had problems with the latest update so far. Messages load a bit slow if I'm not it for a long time but it's not such a major issue for me. I would also like to see some helpful administrative features for group chats (i.e. having designated users as admins who would be the only ones allowed to add/remove other users in their group chat, as well as choose theme and profile picture, and be able to delete any notes within the group chat). That would be great :)",
      "It's okay. I only use the chat feature but what i don't like about sending voice notes is that recordings always erase while I'm in the middle of recording and then i have to start all over again. Or if I'm listening to a recording and i need to so before it ends, then i have to start all over. You should have a option to press record and not have to hold it to talk and also, a day forward and rewind option.",
      "Notification volume: Incoming message: affected by \"Ring volume\" Incoming call: affected by \"Media volume\" *Why* are they different? Do not disturb mode typically has zero ring volume but *not* zero media volume - if you want to fall asleep listening to an audiobook or play white noise through headphones to block sound, you cannot set media volume to zero. So any incoming call on LINE will wake you up. (Incoming telephony call will not, because it uses ring volume, of course). (HTC U12 Plus)",
      "After the recent update, it automatically add ALL my LINE friend to my phone's contact list.... Why? Why wouldn't you ask me first? Just add a Pop-up window and say: \"Hey! Dear LINE users! We just add a new feature that can add your LINE friend to your phone contact list! Would you like to try it out?\". Instead of that, YOU MESSED UP MY CONTACTS LIST!!!! Even I turned the feature off, there are still all there. Now I have to delete them ONE-BY-ONE. I thought Japanese are very smart! 😡",
      "Developer should give a confirmation (like \"are you sure\" or \"yes and no\" when calling button pressed/touched. I've accidently called a random people in my contact, and that is awkward.

      "Like the old phone book, this used to be a FREE service. Now you have to pay to find 80% of the numbers you need. ON EDIT- Developer's response is misleading. There was a time when \"much\" of the content was free, but land-line numbers, addresses, etc..., rarely come up at no charge anymore. Maybe 20% are free, so I stand by my original post.",
      "Extremely dissatisfied. After paying the $1 trial you then find you have to pay per query. I cancelled my trial and they still billed my credit card $19.99 !!! I am now wasting my time trying to resolve this issue and I have learned I'm not the only one whom they have done this to. Whitepages is a name a lot of people had come to respect. I say shame on you for trying to scam individuals. The premium membership is not even worth it at any price!",
      "With this app, I am able to check caller's ID without answering the phone. With the subscription I am able to get even more information on certain callers. I was even able to reconnect with an uncle with whom my family had lost touch with after my mother's passing. WhitePages is a great resource.",
      "very helpful for phone calls from numbers you don't know. Helps you find out who is calling in most cases. Edit: after using this app for some time I'm finding that way to much of the info is either old or just wrong. Dropped from 5 to 3 stars. Please update",
      "The one thing that I find frustrating is the number id function. Are people so nosey that they have to do background checks on people? Phone numbers are supposed to be public info unless the number is unlisted. To pay for background check just to get an id is more than an imposition. I know many sites charge for public info we used to get from phone books, but if you are going to take the place of phone books, then do it and stop penalizing the public."

      "It is not blocking spam calls, messages and not displaying caller id anymore since last update. It want's us to set it as the default dialer and sms app. Why do we need to do that ? What is going on ? Do you need users to uninstall your app forever ? Also I can't find the way to unsubscribe the monthly payment option for my other truecaller premium account. It keeps taking monthly payment from my bank account and i am unable to stop it.",
      "I have been using this app for the past two years but recently i updated the app and found out that my phone can'nt ring out when my phone is on closed screen. I have waited for two updates but this issue persisted. I just did another update today with the promise that the issue is fixed but after the update the issue persisted. What can i do. I am using infinix hot 4, Model: infinix X557, Android Version: 7.0. Please, i need feedback soonest. Thanks",
      "Does not show proper accurate information regarding \"last seen status\" . It doesnt update last seen status of any contact daily. It shows \"last seen yesterday\" even when the person is on the call the next day. Someday it shows proper status and some day it doesn't. Please throw some light on this problem and fix this problem. Thanks.",
      "My experience with true caller is really fine and interesting as I specially have confidence to detect the person who is calling. Not only that but it is also easy to access a person who could have wish to make any kind of criminal offence. Whatever, end of this, I have a little suggestion to improve the software which may act as a mirror of the society.",
      "go to Gallery, share a pic, select True caller messages, then you cannot multiselect contacts to share with. you have work from the opposite direction and 'Create a group chat' . Wondering if the people that design this app actually use it. The Subscription price has doubled and it's now more agressive with full screen ads blocking you while trying to use it. The only thing positive i have to say about this app is that the others suck more."

      "I used this app and I quite like it. However, there are flaws, when a friend sends a picture, sometimes it loads or shows a no image picture. Today I had a problem to where I was getting nonfictions but they did not show up in app. Please fix, then I will have five stars. Otherwise, clean, good, and useful for the time being. I also seriously appreciate the dark mode. And I essentially use the calling, I love it. Another annoying thing is that I can only show 15 second videos. Otherwise good! :D",
      "This is a great app. It REALLY does provide FREE long distance calling, WITHOUT having to earn credits! BUT, I have had THREE problems with this app; 1) Very often, I am not able to hang up, after dialing a number! 2) Quite often, after about two or three minues, the calls are cut off right in middle of my conversation! 3) There does not seem to be any technical support!",
      "Great App. I moved from the city to the mountains and couldn't get dependable reception. I was suggested this app and tried it out. It works perfect. As long as you have a WIFI signal you will be able to call receive calls text and pic message. I like it so much that I've upgraded to the $2.99 a month and plan and use this as a perment means of communication now.",
      "Meh, I had higher hopes for this app based on all the 5 star reviews, but was disappointed with my experience. Constant ads EVERYWHERE, sometimes multiple ads on one screen, and most of them take up half my screen, which is excessive, and beyond annoying. It frequently stalls on a solid black screen anytime I try to do anything, when u choose a contact it doesn't pick their default number, it picks the first number you added to that contact. Also, setting the background has never worked for me.",
      "It's a decent free text & calling app, which works over WiFi or Mobile Data equally well. I've also upgraded to premium, which improves the app's versatility, but the free service is a complete product without requiring it to be premium, like a lot of other text & calling apps out there. So, that being said, I bet you're like, \"He rated it 4☆ out of 5☆ though, what's the catch?\" The 4☆ rating is cuz to keep the same cell# from changing you must text or call at least once every 3 days or...poof!"

      "If you loose your mobile number you are fu*** The app is good but the service is HORRIBLE!! The contact formular is hidden on their website. Only email, no chat. You cannot even reply to the email they send you. I have my email, my old old number, the contract (but handwritten) I know everything about my account (last chats &friends) they could ask my friends (Like Wechat to send them a code to restore the account) but they just dont want to do it. I feel that their english is not good as well",
      "When i started making an account on kakao, it suddenly says that i was banned because of violating the operation policy. I have read the operation policy and none of it makes sense on why i was banned. I was just registering. Also it says that it will send a message on when the ban will be lifted but so far, to this day, no message have been sent. Not worth my time.",
      "I used this app all the time, it was my main way to talk to my older sister, but I reset my phone and now the app is saying it can't send me a verification code via text message to my number and to check the website. I did check the website and it was no help at all, I can't use the app anymore :(",
      "It temporary baned me from open chat and it has been like that for weeks. I have done nothing to violate the operation policy. I have googled the situation but a lot of people are getting the same thing. I am starting to think their is a bug in the app that needs to be fixed.",
      "Cannot get this app to work. From day one it has told me my account has been temporarily disabled. Tried deleting my account to start over. Only way to delete the account is to unlink it from kakaotalk in the app. But i cant get in the app. No option to get help online. So frustrating!!"

      "Feb 29, 2020 update: I am uninstalling and cancelling. Just a couple days ago I could no longer open my messages, which my livelihood depends on being able to do. Tech support was unable to resolve over 2 days. I bought a yearly subscription of $47 on Feb 13, and am bummed I just lost this $. ~~~~~ Quick customer service! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I can't increase the call volume. I use this as a biz number, so it's important I can hear it ring when it's not on me.",
      "I've only had the app for less than an hour, but I love it because it's the first virtual number app that allows me to receive short codes from my banks. Can't text back short code numbers though unless you have the international plan I assume. So far, this is perfect for my needs. I travel outside the US full-time and my US carrier canceled my plan. I buy local sims where I travel, but need a US number that accepts short codes I receive from institutions like my banks.",
      "I purchased two numbers in different countries, as only certain countries can both call + send SMS. Tested both the NZ and US numbers and worked exactly like it said that it would. So far the best app that replaces my old app that isn't available anymore. And that app was sweet. You could change your caller ID to whatever you wanted every time that you made a call. Perhaps the updated version Hushed might be able to incorporate that feature into there fabulous app making it a superlative one!",
      "Doesn't work for Twitter verification purposes, which is why I purchased it. Still shows up as \"unsupported number\" at Twitter. Customer service replied that 3rd party verification may not be supported. This application did not work on my Galaxy Tab A S5e for making or receiving calls. This tablet has no phone guts; was using wifi. So it is $3.99 down the drain. Find something else...",
      "Works as described. Two negatives for me. 1. Message count seems to not count correctly. Over counts. 2. Wish I could password this app. It's not secure from prying eyes if someone else has your phone."

The only choice is to cancel the subscription and then restart it but every time I do, it reverts back to monthly billing. On one phone the app works well and I am able to report numbers. On the second phone, every single time I try to report a number, the app fails. I have submitted this issue 12 to 15 times and I get no response.",
      "Unfortunately like everyone else has said, this app worked like a champ. It basically caught everything. Now it doesn't stop any calls. I actually forgot I had installed it since it was just doing nothing. I suppose I'll check in periodically to see if any major issues get resolved.",
      "Like other reviewers have noted, the app worked great for the first few months. Just long enough to lure you into the paid subscription.it has quit working on my phone and doesn't catch any robocalls, even when the app identifies them as robocalls.I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, giving it permissions to absolutely everything on my phone, and still no dice.cancelled my subscription, and when the subscription is up I will uninstall the app.",
      "Generally works well. I wish they'd add an option to block invalid phone numbers, such as those with an exchange that doesn't exist within that area code. The \"Whitepages\" app displays that fact immediately, so I know the data exists somewhere.",
      "Doesn't work. Same number of robocalls as before. Call logs are wildly inaccurate which suggests that they may be manipulating them to make their app look like it's doing more than it is."

      "Glad to see that emojis have been updated. However, the \"Last seen\" status is a feature that is still completely messed up: it always shows that someone is online or was active a few minutes ago, even though he has been inactive for a while (even if he hasn't touched his phone for hours). And while I write a message to someone, Viber does not update his status and shows that he is online even if he is not any more. Still needs improvements.",
      "Have used Viber for years now, however in the last 24 hours it's become unusable. It freezes my entire Pixel 4 while replying to a message, or it will freeze while typing a reply. It also force shuts itself with a \"Viber is not responding\" pop up. Really frustrating as the majority of my family and friends use this app and not being able to reply to any of my messages is very annoying.",
      "Ok they reverted back. Thank you. Old review : last version took away \"attach my location\" to a message option. Was the only reason I used this app. Other similar apps are better at other things. Viber removed a feature and does not even mention it in the update. Viber is taking any options/features that made it better then others out. Businesses work on features that differentiate their product, Viber works on make their product same or worse then others by taking features away. genius!",
      "BRING BACK DOODLE FEATURE, PLEASE! No matter I set picture quality on excellent, it's still poor quality when I receive it. Just add original quality, not low, medium, excellent or whatever. For video it's even worse. When I receive video, the same has much worse quality than original file that was sent to me. ADD ORIGINAL QUALITY for sending / receiving photos and videos, WHERE DO YOU LIVE? And ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MESSAGES, really? Annoying and not good at all. 😠 Bring back Doodle!!!",
      "I have used Viber for text and voice calls for many years now. I have been mostly satisfied with the overall performance of the app, however, the app has been very leggy lately. Messages sent and recieved mostly do not appear at all or appear a few hours later or some times even next day. Photos sent keep uploading and then 'failed to send' notification appears and photos recieved do not download. I have checked if I have 4g or wifi issues, but I don't. I t is the app issue. Please fix."

You enter your genuine details, you get connected to bots, gals just want to ask you to make calls which is paid and super expensive, which means, you literally waste your time.

Then paid to call or contact further.",

      "Mark my words, totally worth it. I can finally watch whatever I want on Netflix without the need to wait MONTHS until a new season comes out. I can also play MMO games that aren't available in my region. Thing is, I'm using it on mobile AND on PC and I'm totally satisfied with it. It was so devastating to be blocked away from stuff + miss the chance to watch upcoming seasons at the same time everybody else watches. But no more! Bless avast 🙂 (oh the antivirus is also great!)",
      "So far I like it - seamless setup and easy to work with. My main concern is that it drains my phone battery. I left the VPN on overnight and my battery was almost empty, with Avast Secureline consuming 42% of it within just a few hours",
      "I don't know what happened, it was working till today morning the app has been stopped with error message \"there is a problem in network\" i tried to reconnect on internet package and on wifi but no use, i sent an email to support but useless also i need help..",
      "Other than the inconvenience of having trusted links have to verify my identity because of the VPN, I will gladly use this app to secure my location.",
      "Lately I am very unhappy with this app. Have used it on at least one platform for as long as secureline has been around but never have I experienced this. No matter which WiFi connection I use, avast secureline connects and instantly slows the connection down to kbs instead of usual speeds. Fix this issue as soon as possible and I will change back to 5 stars."

      "Frustrating. I have been a Yahoo customer since we first got email. It used to work fine. That hasn't been true for years, especially with the mobile app. Why does is take a full minute or more just to delete one or move one email. Frequently, a message saying unable to complete function appears. If it does happen to work at first, the emails reappear in my Inbox. I really don't like it at all. But, I've had it for long it's be too disruptive to change all of my accounts.",
      "While I use Yahoo mail a lot oh, I don't really understand the different versions of it. On my Android phone and my laptop with Windows 10, I use the app. It mostly gets the job done. But when I am taken to Yahoo mail from Craigslist for example, I'm replying to an ad, there's a version of Yahoo mail that is so much better. But I've never understood how to gain access 2 the Yahoo mail that has spell check built into it and graphically is much more rich and interesting.",
      "This ap is seriously flawed. Frustrating. It doesn't respond as intended. All the features are there. For instance, delete more than one email. I deleted emails,only for them to reappear..and now unresponsive.it flashes an awful lot. As though it wants to respond.. It's not as smooth either, as outlook. The one thing I appreciate, is being able to select more than one email..using *one button. That's where it stops. Whatever action i want to preform, doesn't appear to work.",
      "Very fast and organized for retrieval or back read. Before I had two alternating yahoo addresses. Strangely one was compromised. It had no messages to display in any folder. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Put back both. The second one is still compromised. Reinstalled and retained only the first one. Still satisfied. The other one I use yahoolite app but it's not as convenient.",
      "I cannot get into my email account all of a sudden. It keeps telling me it's \"initializing mailbox\" and then it eventually says its currently unavailable, and try again later. I've been trying for 2 days. I've uninstalled and then installed the app again. It keeps doing the same thing. I tried to create a new password and its telling me, basically, that I tried too many times and to wait 24 hrs. I'm expecting important emails and now I'm locked out! OMG, I'm so frustrated!"

I can text msg friends, call friends just like normal but when my friends joined too we can talk n tex 24/7 for free ! Bye bye phone bill, play a game take a quiz n theres your credit, easy easy !! I love this app !",
      "I was charged 39.99 and didn't keep or use the app for a full month more like less than a week. I was charged and the only way to contact the app is through email that they dont ever respond to. You'll be lucky to get anywhere using this app but you can count they'll charge you even after you've canceled and obviously they don't like refunding your money even though they wrongfully take it",
      "I have installed several apps to get credits, but I have not received them as well as I invited number of friends and they installed TalkU app in thier phones and I have received credits for that. Furthermore, I try to contact the help support through TalkU app and through sending them number of emails, but again no one responded to any",
      "Terrible APP!! I never even used this app 3 days after I downloaded it, they charged my card $39.99. Mind you, I never even put any card information in. They will not give me a refund! I am very angry and if I could give them a negative star review I would! I would highly recommend not using this app, unless you want them to take your money without permission!",
      "I'm changing my review of you guys. I use to buy credits and get free credits from your offers all the time. You was my go to app. For business and staying in touch with my family overseas. NOW,,, I never get my credit's from your offers. Everytime I try to call my family overseas your app goes to people i don't even know. I tried complaining and getting you guy's to fix your problems. I'm done with you. I found a company that takes care of their customers. TextNow people. TalkU is sinking bad"

      "I will switch to 5 star if this gets fixed. Since the update 8 hours ago, this app stopped working for my Galaxy Samsung S10. It just shows me a blank screen! Very frustrating. I've reset my phone, switched all sorts of settings, but nothing is working for this app to work. I need this app to open for me so I can do my job that requires me to use Voxer.",
      "Voice messages sometimes go out sounding garbled or washed out. If I have the app running in the background when I change from one Bluetooth pairing to another it distorts other audio output until I close Voxer. Not uncommon to receive notifications at a great delay. Not uncommon to stop receiving/loading messages until turning wifi and data off and back on, often have to kill the process along with that too. Wouldn't use it if I didn't have friends who do. Fails most of what it does.",
      "Horrible App. App does not verify attachments before being sent. It sends them automatically. Use it for business and forced company to get pro due to you being inability to delete messages. If you need a communication app for business, go with Whats App before this one. Also it is extremely outdated software wise.",
      "I pay for voxer pro. It never works. Starts talking out loud when someone sends a message even when my phone is set to silent. Cannot go back and load messages older than the last 5. Cannot not see who read them. Used to work but now hasn't for weeks.",
      "Great app. I've been using it for about 5 years now. Occasional bugs, especially between Android and iPhone users. But seems to be less and less problems as the updates come in."

      "This app used to work great until about a year and a half ago. Glitches so bad it barely works. The send button vanishes so you have to leave the conversation. Notifications don't work. Complete junk. Switched to Chomp SMS and I am way happier. The developers know... I've read so many messages from others complaining about the same thing. Bye!",
      "Don't do it unless you have money to waste. Downloaded the app, it had really cute themes, but only if you pay $60 for a year. They had a 3 day trial, on day 3 all of the themes and changes I had made were gone, so I assumed, free trial over, and that I would need to subscribe to continue if I so chose. Nope, the next day my bank account had a charge of $59.99. I reached out to the company to try to get a refund, no one ever even responded. Absolutely bad business. Stick with Message +",
      "Not good.. After the latest update.. You can't reply to messages right away unless you exit the app and go back in.. And it will take a few seconds or more to load it so you can reply to a message.. If you needed to hurry to reply to a message in emergency.. I say your out of luck.. Don't waste time with this app! You'll regret it if you do! I'm not kidding! Months later and still not working! And all these fake 5 star reviews on here by the developers are ridiculous! Update did NOT fix issue!",
      "This used to be a really great app. The last few updates have sucked. I hate the fact that for the past few updates, I have to click on a notification then exit out of the program then restart the program to reply to whoever sent me a message. As of the last update I have lost all notification sound. No matter what I've tried I cannot seem to get the sound back. So now I have to constantly check my phone to see if anyone has messaged me. I hope they fix this app soon as I paid for it",
      "*EDIT* my virus protection is now recognizing GoSMS as malware. I used to love this app but has completely fallen apart. I can no longer send photos and the message popup is so buggy it causes me to force close the app. I've even somewhat looked past the fullscreen pop up ads (that i find to be pretty unsafe in an emergency situation)."

So far I do like this app a lot Original It seems really great until I realized I still have to see ads after paying for premium version and have to pay another extra $2 just to get rid of them. and then when I turn on one of the features for premium it just takes me to the page to buy premium even though I already did.",
      "\"When it works it's just great and when it doesn't it'll drive you crazy!\" Ok, so I was referring to \"One Time Password's\" that are texted to the phone from a service like Amazon. I've been informed that using Talkatone for Account Verifications won't work with the non paid version at all & sometimes it is not available with any VoIP line due to the sheer amount of fraudulent activity out there. I'm happy with the service I have for sure! I'm so cheap. LoL",

I really do like Talkatone because it's so durable and it's completely free to where I don't have to invest in minutes I'm really grateful for this app because I can't afford a phone right now so this gives me the ability for me to speak to my loved ones. Thank you Talkatone.",
      "The text message history is keep on disappearing. The top 3 to 4 people i can see with whom i texted but the remaining are not visible and can't scroll the screen to see other text. Also from today morning, seeing that i can not send any text message and keep on getting NOT DELIVERED error. Highly unreliable performance. Please fix this.",
      "This app is frustrating when someone calls me we either can't hear each other or they can't hear me. It doesn't ring when someone calls you and when I send a message it says not delivered I thought it was my wifi when I turn the wifi off and turn it back on it still says the same thing. this is the only way I can communicate with the people I love and it is so frustrating when it doesn't work may y'all please please fix this problem."

      "The only problem is cheap interfaces! With a decent device, not the garbage sold on Fakebook, it does what it says. One really annoying problem is that it refuses to quit. Doesn't matter how many times you close it, Quit or even Force Stop, it's like a Premiership manager and bounces back, demanding to be connected. This can lead to problems with the cheapo devices as you can't pair and then open the app.",
      "App freezes, stops responding, then completely fails to load. Delete from device. Reinstall. Fails to load. Application is useless because there is no product support. Nobody will help you. You cannot contact the manufacturer. They take your money. When it does not work, you are at a loss. Do not throw your money away. Use FORScan or equivalent. Even in it's working configuration, this app does not allow you to access your car's computer to make any changes. You cannot remap your air-to-fuel ratio. You cannot change your transmission shift points, or adjust the transmission shift from firm to soft. You cannot change the profile settings for tire size. You can not enable or disable any settings. When it works, before the app crashes, freezes, and fails' it's just a glorified monitor. Information which is already accessible via your onboard display screen.",
      "I have been using it for 5 years now, along with plugins, with el-cheapo dongles and the recommended ones, across 2 Android phones. Although used with older than '12 cars, it has been completely reliable, dependable and trustworthy to have diags on the engines. Cheaper dongles do give the occasional connection hiccup, but that isn't the app's fault. I also like the ability to work with the plugins for simulator games to be used as a HUD! It might take a bit of time to configure, but that's it!",
      "I have a VW Passat B5.0 2.8 V6 30v 4 motion/synchro with a few problems, like a miss fire, but the error code count is 0 or zero. All I can get out of this app is what's already on my dashboard so it's totally useless for me as it doesn't do what I have paid it to do. Please show me some firkin error codes. There has to be some. Plus the help is just awful. Its a complex app so proper help would be appreciated. Oh and tested on two modules. Just junk.",
      "It's an amazing app; I've used it for years. A definite 5-stars for functionality. However, only 4-stars overall due to very poor UI design. While it's very powerful, learning to use it is a real chore, and even after my years of use, I still feel like I'm not getting everything out of it that it has to offer, due to it's convoluted interface. A future interface refresh would be very welcome."

      "so far I have sent 3 texts and answered 1 call, and this app works very well! 1/31/19 Update - this app has not let me down at all! I fell ill last November and stayed ill through January. I did not use my phone or my number, so I lost the number. I recently got a new phone, so I searched the Google Store for this specific app and just downloaded. Hopefully we still have a 5 star app!",
      "I think it's a nice App but frequently hybernate (sleep off) and crashes on my infinix Hot 4, version 6.0 within just a few minutes of logging in every time . Though calls and sms really worked fine, but I couldn't hear my voice in 2 calls attempts when I tried a call to it with my real phone 📱 number. Please fix up soon so I won't Uninstall. Please!",
      "This dumb app. Type a text, it freezes and closes app. There's a 4 sec delay on phone calls which is irksome. Freezes, closes and generally screws up. Once again some how wound up with the $5.99 per week version. Now they will ignore my still active $2.99 membership and change my number AGAIN!!! It's damned ridiculous and a pain to change my number every time this app randomly changes my subscription.",
      "It's great 😊 & it definitely comes in handy. Sometimes the when u make calls it doesn't work that well. That's only because whatever wifi u hooked up to sucks. Other than that I love the app I always get all my messages. Few calls from people I don't know but that's gonna happen with or without the app. Thanks guys for this app. I love & my husband loves it also",
      "Awesome app, 100% you can count on tthis app to work everytime. I'm a beta tester for this app and since day one it has really impressed me. Don't know why it has taken me so long to voice my opinion, my life got in the way before, my apologies to the creators....fine work guys!"

      "This is very well app. This gives me a second mobile number from which i can do my office work or can prank with friends . This also provide us 20 minute free calling to place a call. its cost for more than 20 minute is more cheaper than other there are no advertisement for which we can irritate . There are no many formalities to do . Thank to the app developer for this app Thank you",
      "They give you temporary phone numbers, with varying expiration dates on your free account, so expect the number to expire, as they want you to buy a premium account. Customer service is also very hostile, with a holier than thou attitude. If you use this free app, expect to have to get new phone numbers constantly, no matter how often you use it. I strongly recommend you pay for the premium service. I am very happy with it, and the phone number does not change on renewal, as most other voips do",
      "Works wonderfully awesomely amazingly good!. Best phone app out of the 15 or so I tried. You get the odd full screen ad, WHICH IS ANNOYING AS HELL (devs?) but there are no ad timers, so you just close the ad with the x in the corner. I've Never had a dropped call and voice clarity is always excellently superbulous! No echos, no delays! I give two thumbs up and straight A's.. Plus the name of the app is low key and not some dumb name like oomoo which I wud b embarassed to say outloud to someone",
      "Actually a very handy app. Could do without the advertisements. It is easy to install and is ready for use immediately after choosing your number to use. No hassle no difficult settings easy to use. I recommend anyone needing a second line for whatever reason including privacy this is the app.",
      "This app was fine until I forgot my password. I've jumped through hoop after hoop with this company. Password resetting simply doesn't work for any email address. Emails are never sent. I've lost all my texts and now any account associated with my phone numbers with 2nd line. Don't waste your time."

      "😁👍👍👍I just downloaded this app and this is exactly what I've been waiting for. At start you get 5 credits which is 1 credit per call than you must purchase additional credits. I don't think the prices are unreasonable for what this app offers and it really depends on how often you honestly need to hide your number. Plus this app is super easy to use and the voice changing feature is awsome. Great job to the developers. I love spoofcard. An app I won't mind spending a few dollars on.",
      "I like the concept of the app and how you can disguise but the voice changer sucks. The girl sounds like a robot and the man has a very deep voice. I tried pranking my friends and they obviously knew it was me. And the fact you can only make 5 calls (or 2 recorded calls) for free disgusts me. Over all it seems like it could become a good app, it's just not quite there yet.",
      "Tried it out recvd 5 free credits. Was able to make one call it went str8 to vm. With 4credits left it kept saying enter access code. Its bogus not worth trying",
      "The background noise feature is awesome & sets this app apart from any others like it which there isn't many that are actually legit but this one is. And to set your caller ID to anyone u want!? Perfect 👌 So far....great app 👍",
      "Does not spoof Caller ID all the time! Not only that, but it even charges a credit per minute when displaying your own number. Would love to give a much better review, but with this issue I just can't."

      "Since installing Pulse 2 weeks ago I have sent more SMSs than I did in the 12 months before. The native apps (I'm using the Linux and OSX apps) make it so easy to manage messages. I've cleaned out all my old SMSs for the first time in years and it only took me 20 minutes. The apps have numerous issues - I had to manually refresh my account when I first set it up, I can't see a way to create folders using the native app, I had an SMS fail to send from my phone but the desktop app shows it as sent. BUT the ability to manage my SMSes from my desktop and smash out a 160-character text in 15 seconds is just too good. I would give this app 7 stars if I could, regardless of all the little issues.",
      "This app is very inconsistent, It will send and receive messages and a few minutes later it won't send and it won't receive messages. I unenstalled it and reinstalled it and it worked great for an hour and then -- AGAIN -- it stopped sending and receiving messages. Sadly this program has several virtues but if it isn't trustworthy, it's useless 😟😟",
      "Love everything about Pulse, except the issue you sometimes face of sending / receiving video and the quality of the video. I've read numerous chats as to why that is and possible fixes, but still the issue exists. I'm a Verizon customer with the new Google Pixel 4, so if anyone has any insight or resolution on this please enlighten me. Still a (5) star app in my opinion, but really wish there was a way to remedy the video thing",
      "Excellent app! The ability to filter on phrases is a key feature that makes this app worth the purchase! However, there is a bug in the app. If you delete or archive multiple conversations at once, only the first one you do takes effect. If you exit the app and go back in, then all of the other archive/delete operations are forgotten and those messages return to the inbox.",
      "I've used this app for a very long time and have always loved it. However, for a few months now, some of my messages come in VERY delayed or not at all. Many times, pictures that are sent to me won't download or show up. I uninstalled Pulse for a week and used a different app and didn't experience any of those issues. But I love Pulse so much, that I re-installed it after a week, only to immediately experience the exact same things. It's still one of the better SMS apps available though"

      "I used to like this app a lot! I bought it a while back. My phone did a system update and it updated this app, and now I absolutely HATE the fact that I have to use this app as my default phone manager to get the premium features I paid for like \"disconnect\". Why make this a must? Just terrible, it was fine the way it was. Can't even hang up my phone call now if I accidentally closed out the app and it freezes ALL the time during calls.",
      "Scam/spam app. Stay away! Only after installation and giving away all your private info and Facebook passwords do they tell you this is a paid service after the first week. Even so, I've had 5 spam \"Apple customer service\" robocalls in the HALF HOUR since I signed up for Call Control. Starting to think Call Control is the spammer scammer itself.",
      "The caller ID sucks. Other apps show caller ID on most numbers and this one shows nothing for most numbers. It sucks so bad, it doesn't even show numbers from businesses that call where I know the name should be displayed. Just wasted 29$ on premium and it is a POS. I want my money back.",
      "Calls are put through that should not be. Only contacts should ring through, all others should be sent to voicemail. I get SO MANY unwanted calls!!! I am very displeased with how the service screens calls.",
      "This is the app to get for controlling Calls: you can choose which numbers go to voicemail, and which to Disconnect. And, you can filter by Exchange, or Area Code, or any possible groupings of digits. Thx!"

Discoverable mode\r\nTurn on discoverable mode on your swatch. Let’s say you want to pair your phone with your car’s infotainment system. First, go into your phone’s or iwatch app settings and tap on Bluetooth. Then depress the buttons on your infotainment system, usually on the steering wheel or center stack, to get it looking for the device. Once it finds your phone, the car may ask for a numeric code you need to confirm or input on your phone. After you do so, the devices should be paired.\r\n\r\nProblems with BT pairing\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the devices you are trying to pair are close each to other. Do not try to pair a phone with a keyboard or any not Android/Android Wear bluetooth based devices.\r\n\r\n2.

Some older devices just try to connect with the last thing they paired with. If a Bluetooth device was previously paired with something else, turn off that other gadget.\r\n\r\n4.

And for your own welfare. A++++++😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉",

      "You pay for a certain service and what they don't tell you is the service you paid for doesn't include what was initially advertised. Suddenly every little add on is an extra fee here and 'oops it looks like this wasn't included in the package you purchased'. Spokeo - you don't provide the services advertised. Tis all false!!",
      "Pretty positive. Just frustrated that years ago I called and corrected my own data and now I'm deleted from system. I'm in Barrington IL and a cousin in California, who has my maiden name exactly... is showing up with some of my data. I've been told there's nothing that can be done and Spokeo said some corrections can migrate from the social world. Very upsetting on that regard otherwise it's been very helpful for reunions that I chair periods"

I loved it so much I bought credits...but soon after I did my phone broke. When I downloaded this app onto my new phone all my credits I bought were gone and I had barely used any of the credits I purchased. I still have the same Google account, ph number , even service provider. Feeling rather ripped off",
      "It's a good app. You only get three calls per day. But about 4 day after installing my 3 calls are still on zero. I dont want to buy more. I dont understand I love this app just cant use it anymore. I think think this is stupid.😠",
      "Used to work great but since last update I can't control who the call comes from. I have emailed back and forth with the developer with no change to the app. I have paid for pranks a few tones but i won't again and i suggest you don't either. Developer: I have contacted you multiple times and you guys just keep telling me to uninstall and install the app back. That doesn't work!!!",
      "I bought credits a while back but had to uninstall and reinstall the app only to discover the credits I bought were gone. I talked to customer service to retrieve the credits I paid for and was never given them. You also have to choose a number from a list instead of being able to put your own in now. This obviously greatly decreases the chance of anyone answering. Avoid this app.",
      "I have emailed the developer with my issues. At first it was fun. I was able to call and prank people with other people phone numbers now I'm not allowed. Secondly I paid to have credits when the app was fun. I upgraded my phone and poof all my credits are gone. PLEASE GIVE ME A REFUND OR CORRECT THE ISSUE. THANKS"

Overall I'm getting a pretty bad impression about security and privacy.",

      "A very subpar app that tends to be more problematic than useful. My biggest gripe is the auto logout without notification. This is a serious annoyance which impacts my ability to receive and respond to calls in a timely manner. Dialing is also very cumbersome and problematic. At times it'll redial a previous number instead of the number I typed. These two issues make this service more trouble than it's worth and I'll be searching for a new service when my subscription expires.",
      "At first the app seamed like a great option. I have been a paying customer for over a year now and will be switching. Lately I have not been getting notifications or calls intermittently. The service and app are not reliable and has made my business look unprofessional to my clients. The windows app also has many issues and never stays up to date with messages. Do not get this service if your looking to rely on it for a business. Yes I have worked with support to troubleshoot the issue. It happens on both Cellular and Data.",
      "My calls are put on hold when I get a call on my regular cellphone number. This is a very big problem. Line2 says they are not able to do anything about it, I did not have this issue with sideline, so now I'm on the hunt for another app that will port my number. Wish you would fix this.",
      "I have been using this application exclusively for a my business line for about two years. Originally it worked well; with only minor call quality issues. However, since the latest update ( and my latest Android update to Android 10) it has been making my business life a living hell. First, the app no longer pops up when I receive a phone call, I literally have to open the app every time a call rings in. Secondly, the call quality and reliability is horrible, it interferes with my normal calls!",
      "Nearly impossible to cancel. Couldnt find it on the site or in the app. It ran for a few months. I finally called, left a message to cancel and please get a refund. They didnt cancel it but finally sent me email instructions on how to cancel it. This is clearly a scam. Once they have your card its nearly impossible to stop it. They make you jump through every hoop until you finally get to cancelation. Just hoping to spare other people from this monstrosity."

      "So I am really disappointed with this app. I should have read the reviews first. I just tried it for the first time. The main reason I wanted this app was for the recording feature. I set it to automatically record my conversations and when I ended my call I went back to replay my recording to see how it sounded. Well there is absolutely no sound at all. An hour and 20 min conversation of dead silence. I can't even find any options to fix this. Will be uninstalling asap.",
      "Don't even waste your time with this one. You can't hear the person on the other end line. You might just as well talk to yourself. Blocked calls? Pfffff.....they still get thru. The blocking don't work at all. If someone calls the conversation isn't even recorded. The blocking method has nothing.to do with it. FIX IT SO IT WILL RECORD! THIS APP SUCKS BUG TIME!",
      "Great application as it has a great database of users but has one very serious and anoying bug. It freezes the phone once try to identify caller and it keeps popup screen frozen for 30 sec to 1 minute after receiving the call. Sometimes freezing does not allow to answer the call and it remains frozen for sometime. Too sad as this started after last upgrade.",
      "Has everything you need in a call app/call blocker/caller ID, call recorder.though it does let some useless unsolicited telemarketer's calls through sometimes. It Work's well once you figure out all the services it performs.But the circled 'yes' choice isn't showing on their questionaire so you can't answer in the affirmative saying YES if that is your choice of answer but you can answer \" NOT SURE\" if you want which is weird and you'll be tempted to cause can't use YES 😱",
      "I have had a bad experience with this App. Since I have installed it on my phone I am no longer able to answer calls. They do come through but it is not showing anywhere or even giving me an option to answer call, I can only see the caller once they have hanged up and that's on my recent calls."

      "I love this app and have been using the free version for several years. The customer support is the most amazing part of the app. They really care about how their app is running, respond lightening fast to questions and give easy to understand instructions on how to fix issues, which in my case have been problems with my phone not updating correctly. Keep up the good work Textra!",
      "I was really enjoying this app but l started receiving messages all through the night last night, which is highly unusual for me. Upon contacting the senders to see why they were texting me all night, I found out that those messages were sent during the day and evening, but I never received them until after 2am! Why are my messages being delayed?? People probably thought I was ignoring their messages.",
      "Textra is, and probably always will be my favorite alternative SMS app; it's clean, customizavle and almost identicly to stock Messaging apps. The only reason I'm doing four stars across almost every app I use, is the fact that the only new feature with paying for premium is ad removal. I get you have to make your money, but it would be nice to pay even an extra dollar for some more features! Otherwise, this is an amazing app!",
      "This app is top notch. I have a Google pixel 3 and you really can't customize the messaging app the comes stock with the phone. So I figured I'd try this app and this app has many customization features. You can change the way the icon is colored, specific icons for specific contacts, custom word bubble shapes, different fonts, a huge GIF library and many more awesome features. If you want an extremely customizable SMS app, this is the one. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",
      "I love this app so much. The messages send right away, practically EVERYTHING you can customize, and it's just great all together. Hell, you can even change the color of the freaking app icon! This app is exactly what I was looking for. I have one issue though, whenever I send a video or gif or song or whatever, it takes a few minutes to send it, I don't know if my phone is just a little crappy or if it's a issue with the app itself, but still, Textra is great with that issue or not! :D"

Whats the problem? I learnt at a time that apple removed this app due to replications. Again why difficult to get free credit on android",
      "hey developer, after last updated app did not get daily coins 💰 every time network error shows ⚠️ show popup on screen. what is fatal error ? hopefully fix it shortly.",
      "I will update this app before 3days then i notice that i can't check in daily,this app show me network error¿ what is this I don't know please help me...",
      "free unlimited calls and texts are only free when the person that is calling you or the person you're calling has Telos app or service. Even if you're connected to Wi-Fi it's still charges you 3 credits per minute. Maybe good for paid service but as far as free service other apps are better.",
      "Some of the offers they make in exchange for extra credits is misleading. And when you try to claim missing credits from Dingtone, quite often their mailbox is full and it doesn't look like Telos support will help. At the moment U can't even check in daily. Keeps coming up with \"network error\" message."

But woke up to both calls transcribed better than a court reporter could do. I was so impressed I called the FCC, I just had to tell them after being on a do not call list for a decade that didn't work. This app managed to do every they have never achieved. Yes this is the GOLD STANDARD treat yourself to an app that is seamless.",
      "Tjis is an AWESOME app. I initially had install issues...(my bad) uninstalled app, reset phone. And reinstalled. It is working great now. The functionality is awesome the phone screener allows you to interact with the caller without ever having to pick up the phone unless you want to. Voice messaging is awesome. Highly recommended app it's like having a personal secretary.",

      "App working well, just one problem I'm having whilst using youtube. I like to play music in the background while at work, after 20 mins the music pauses and I get a popup asking if i would like to continue watching. It's quite irritating as I don't want to be constantly having to go to my phone every 20 mins. Is there any way to remove this function?",
      "Opening a new tab would show the 'activate advance mode now' and 'manage cards' while not showing my most frequent visited pages. That unbelievably frustrating. I get that you want to advertise for our but not showing it? Really? But you don't show that in incognito mode so I don't get the reason. Atleast it's good at blocking ads from video streaming sites.",
      "I have been using this application for a long time. Initially it was good at blocking advertisements when watching videos on Youtube. Then, advertisements appear continuously and disturbing. I report directly from the application and write reviews. Then, the developer of this application hears user's complaints and makes improvements. My suggestion should be to check periodically so that it doesn't stop users from using this application.",
      "I do not know whether this is a hidden function or not, but whenever I have an incognito tab open, and I quit the app halfway, and then reenter the app, the app will crash, and the tab I had opened earlier will be gone. It doesn't happen for normal tabs but only for incognito mode. Please fix this asap, it has been going on for months now.",
      "I got tired of the massive amount of ads both on the main yahoo news page as well as within the articles themselves. So I downloaded and installed this, and, guess what? Yep! This isn't blocking any ads at all. Uninstalling it within minutes of this review. It's a complete waste of time and memory."

Tried to get a new phone number because it says it expires every two weeks...but it said it would charge me 10 credits...How are you going to make a number expire every two weeks but charge 10 credits to get one? And charge a dollar for 2 credits that it wont let you buy???",

      "I want to love this app, but it just keeps breaking down. I thought moving to a new S10 would solve it...and for a while it was fine. Now I have notifications from phone calls that won't clear, and it otherwise continues to cause more pain than pleasure. From the other reviews here, does not appear you fare any better with the paid version. It's a shame as conceptually it's the best app out there but execution is everything.",
      "In the hope of the app developer reading this, this is more of an error report than a review. I can't seem to contact you either through FB, Twitter or the app's \"Assistance\" so I'm trying here. Today I got a notification from the mood app saying \"This call - Private number\". I have no clue what it means and I can't remove it from my notification area, without disabling all notifications from the app. While trying to report it in the app I received another with a smiley. Why am I getting this?",
      "I used to love this app. Have been using it since 2018. But Mood has recently gone downhill because of all the advertising. I was okay with the new ad banner at the top of the app, but I just found out they've been advertising their app at the end of all my recent text messages without telling me! I've been sending text messages to customers, and they've been getting these ads in my messages! Very embarrassing! App has been deleted and don't recommend it to anyone!",
      "Updated my review. The previous issue of my texts not sending on delay has been resolved. Thank you I always loved this app. Had everything I wanted in a messaging app UNTIL the latest update. I agree with all the other recent reviews. I can't send texts unless I have a 0 second delay set. I'm going to find another messaging app to use, until you fix this issue. I will change my rating if this issue gets resolved",
      "I've used Mood for years but I finally need to stop. It has issues sending messages often as well as processing incoming MMS. It often marks old conversations as unread. This app doesn't work with Google assistant reading your texts if you have this app set as your default SMS app. So no hands free reading (although it can still send texts). Also doesn't forward the SMS to cars (tested on BMW and Jeep infotainment). So no need notification that you have a new message. Hope it improves one day."

      "The best service have i ever seen, when your not able to register another service. Team Numero its kind replace my number and fast respond(too fast like as film The Flash ;kidding). It's recommended for anyone who's want a 2nd number privately. I'am planning to buy for another country again,oh again wanna buy from them. Oh no, i love the service Numero more and more",
      "Excellent. Only free app I found to use a second number for WhatsApp. Soo happy that you can collect coins and get a free social number. Videos are quick and you can collect lots of coins quickly. The only thing is when u get a free social number you can't choose the country eg: I'm from the UK but I got a US number but it works on WhatsApp so I can't complain, also lasts a month and u can renew the same number I think, I'm not there yet at that stage but currently very happy",
      "These days we take privacy of utmost importance. For that reason I don't see why your app doesn't have to work when my VPN is on. In that case any app that doesn't work when my VPN is on is considered the enemy. And thought be selling your information.",
      "Excellent post support and great eSim Number option out in market. They helped me to setup correctly my account and now I have working fine. I will keep testing for a couple months to see how it goes and will then buy subscription for a year.",
      "Great application very quick responsive team they help me alote I accidentally recharge another number in my different phone and I told them to transfer my credentials and numero team do it I love that app its is only medium to talk with my brother i depend on that application and they are doing great work highly recommend thank you team NUMERO ❤❤❤"

      "Doing the premium trial and I can report with this app \"supposedly\" but Activity doesn't even show the numbers that my phone's notification have, even the ones this app tells you about and it hasn't blocked one call yet. It's like they need nomorobos help with a database of current dialers. I keep getting new messages in inbox and it's just a privacystar logo. The local number spoofing needs to be changed to block NOT notify.",
      "This app works fantastic. Was getting 20+ spam calls a day and now the with app I'll get one spam call every 3 months. Works great and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a scam blocker. The premium version is well worth $2 for an entire year",
      "I had to change it from call watch to PrivacyStar because call Watts wasn't supported by Boost Mobile my phone carrier it seems to be working all right so far I just added it to my phone 2 days ago and it seems to be working pretty well I would recommend it. take care and God bless.",
      "Love the app.. but its getting where it doesnt identify alot of numbers.....you have to type them on the bar.. it may or may not identify the caller. When I 1st downloaded the app it was great..but it needs a upgrade...if people can get our number why cant we get their name......",
      "Doesnt work, keeps showing necessary permissions not enabled I've enabled EVERTHING its asked fortwo of the permissions sms and contacts are not listed on my settings page.i cant give it permissions it doesnt ask for automated webpage erases me every time I go to retrieve a file for my complaint I give up.The worst part is I'm paying for this and I have no idea how long it's been down"

      "Whenever I try to press \"Start WiFi Hotspot\" the program just hangs on the words \"Creating Group...\" and makes no progress. It's not like any other repeater program seems to work so it could be my device. That's still quite unhelpful as I couldn't find any help topics around for a solution to this. It might work for you though. Good luck.",
      "Simply, it works unlike many other apps and keeps your connections secure on other devices. Still though I recommend setting up a VPN regardless and if not don't access credit card, debit or any sensitive information. My device detected that my connection with pda net was not secure so I scoured the internet and found this to be the only one that works.",
      "love it! but there's a nasty bug which crashes the app (pixel 3) or reboot the phone (nokia 6.1) related with renaming the hotspot. not sure if it's when name is too big but it sure can happen due to another bug: when after a fresh installation the name is something like \"DIRECT-NetShare_Hotspot\" when it should be just \"Hotspot\" so it fills the rest and becomes \"DIRECT-NetShare-Hotspot\". also, missing #passwordlesswifi!! best of luck with maintaing this amazing app, hope you'll stick around! 😘",
      "Interface is user friendly and the help menu is useful. I haven't noticed any connection issues so far, or received any nasty messages from my carrier. This works as advertised, thank you to the developers! Suggestion: I would like to be able to change the SSID and password settings (maybe this is already possible, and I haven't noticed it)",
      "I have only found this app to work with i317 galaxy note II model phone but no other phone thus far. I am excited to buy an android 10 phone and try this app out. Ive been buying galaxy note 2's for years and using the free Internet from this app on phone with unlimited data because we were astonished that it was faster than my router."

      "I'm having an issue where the first 15 - 20 seconds of a call are very quiet, and the volume then slowly increases until I can be heard properly. Thanks for the reply - unfortunately I don't think it's the microphone as I'm not having an issue with the volume when making phone calls through other applications. Would it be possible to implement a feature that remembers the calibration of the microphone? Unfortunately if not I may need to use a different app as clients are struggling to hear me",
      "Functionality is good. I like the app. But the Device Push Token (400) error keeps coming back. You boot the phone and 95% certain the app is no longer logging in. How often do they need to solve this issue? Note8. I stop the app, clean its cache. And sure enough, now it starts. \"Account ready\". The allowing-it-to-sleep option was a showstopper. Disallow it, et voila! So that solved a biggie. But booting the phone flummoxxing the app, and keeping a now invalidated token, come on!",
      "I am failing to register my account. I contacted my service provider who provided me with the registration details but still I am unable to register. I am sure it's a bug of some sort, can you fix it?",
      "Whenever a call ends or the caller hangs the call before I can answer, Zoiper opens the music player (whatever it's set as default: Spotify, Rocket Player, VLC, ...) and begins to play the music. Contacted the support months ago, no fix yet. Edit: now it's 3 months since their answer in which they said \"should be released in 1-2 weeks\", no fix so far. Almost 1 year has passed since the first time I signaled this. Edit2: signaled the bug again to the support for the 3rd time, got no answer",
      "It's not worked with two connections from the same provider with PUSH enabled. Started normally, but after period of standby, one of connections stop receive incoming calls until manual restart. I'v switched from Bria because their version of PUSH is not a proxy but only a mobile client wake upper but Zoiper not worked too. It's a great pity."

      "To whom it may concern, I've recently (3 day's ago) bought a new subscription and I was just informed that I've exceeded my number of minutes for the month. How can this be possible? This is becoming to be very expensive and costly for me. My cycle isn't up until March 25th of 2020, I'm paying for a service that I'm not able to use, can someone please explain?",
      "I have been paying monthly for about a year now and my issues began when I tried to update credit card information. They have no ability to update credit card information in their app and you have to add another line then try and cancel. They were not able to so successfully and after 3 attempts I now am being charged monthly on 4 lines. Any time you try to communicate with them they have no live humans in service. No phone number, no chat nothing. Submit a request & you get auto EMAILS! 0☆",
      "I've been using Flyp for business and it had been working pretty well overall. It gets tricky when a call comes through because it will disappear after the first ring and if you have a screen lock in your phone some calls get lost completely. The app doesn't allow you to renew your subscription and once it cancels its over. There's no way to contact anyone. The app has a place to only email. Terms and conditions doesn't show anything so getting any assistance isn't easy if it's an issue",
      "Horrible App! I bought a subscription and used the number to run my business. After spending tons to direct traffic to the Flyp number, all calls immediately stopped. I got in touch with Flyp support and they told me my number was no longer supported - when I asked for help cancelling my subscription, they ignored me! Do not make the same mistake as me",
      "2 phone numbers. Neither are working at this time. Both numbers are prepaid by the year's subscription. Close to a couple hundred dollars gone. Now the app is not working. Took my money and didn't provide the service. Whether you pay monthly or yearly...you WILL be scammed and took for your money."

      "So far this app has not disappointed me at all. It has everything that you are looking for. 5 Stars for sure! Won't be disappointed. The only issue I am having is my calls are saying they are being recorded but when I go to listen to them it's dead air, silent. The recording time length is they're just no sound. It could be me, IDK. Not enough to give it anything less than 5 stars. Thanks Drupe. If you have any ideas on my recording issue, please let me know.",
      "It could be a great app only if you weren't trying so hard to reinvent everything. The design is to much, childish even. So many features no one uses, with such a design, makes me rather use a different, straightforward dialer. Try at least to make another, lite and minimalistic version of the app and see the reaction. My bets are it will be more popular. Who, for example, needs a calculator in a dialer, really. Because of these problems I only use it for caller identification.",
      "I like the features and functionality that I get through this app. However, there is one feature which I absolutely don't want as it troubles me almost all the time. When we get or place a call then we get a hold/un-hold button on the top left of the screen. So when we are on the call that button invariably gets pressed through the ear/skin and the call goes on hold in the middle of the conversation. Very troublesome button location. Kindly fix it to get better review.",
      "Records calls but when you play the recordings, you cannot hear the other person. You are loud on the recording of the call and the other person is not even a whisper with a volume booster app and volume at the max. They can not be used as any kind of management in customer satisfaction or as evidence since you can't hear the other person. Useless! Have not found an audio editor that can edit my records from drupe. They can edit ones from other sources of call recording but not these. 100% waste",
      "When in initial set up, the 5th and final screen presents the dots, then moves them to the right of the screen. The problem is that it moves the dots so far too the right of my screen, that they leave the screen entirely leaving me with nothing visible top swipe to the left. I can't use the app without passing this screen. -Can I bypass set up, and just go directly into using the app?"

      "Looooove Marco Polo. Love the ease to use the software, whether you're techy or tech-averse. The only thing I would like would be different filters. I'm sure that makes things more complicated or more difficult, but I hardly use the current ones cause they're pretty basic (and kinda lame [sorry]). Other than that feature lacking, I would have given them a 5 star.",
      "Love that I can connect with people I haven't seen in years!! I can watch the videos as they are talking to me or later. Really love that it reminds me if i have a message I haven't watched yet! Especially now its great for my kids to use to stay in touch with their cousins since traveling is a no go with covid-19.Haven't had any problems at all and been using it for 4 months now.",
      "Actually love the concept, but it sent texts to people in my contacts, which I cant have happen. I have a lot of my customers and coworkers in there, so had to delete account. I get it's trying to spread its name, but I would have actually told people about it, if they didn't do that. Edit: The app developers worked with me to explain how to disable the contact permissions, but still be able to use the app. Thank you!",
      "It is like having a fantastic conversation but on your own time. Even if your grandkids want to tell you something but you aren't available they can leave as long of a video conversation as they want and it is sent easily and quickly and can actually be watched and reacted to in REAL TIME! This simple app is a communication miracle !! So easy to use.. videos can be saved for later viewing or forwarded. LOVE IT!!!",
      "60% of the time the record feature doesn't work, says something went wrong, so I send a problem report each time. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, updated my phone, the app, and still won't work when I try to record. I've taken these steps several times and have to restart my phone every time I want to send a message to someone. It's the most frustrating messaging app I've ever used."

      "First of all I wasn't able to paste a number on the calling field. It would keep placing the wrong country code in front of the number automatically and there was no way to get rid of it. When I select a number from my contacts, it also inserts the wrong country code. Once I managed to actually make the call, the line was awful... so bad that I have up. Without moving to a different location, I made the very same phone call with Messanger and It was perfect. Now explain that.",
      "03/03/2020 Call rate is cheap Negetive : Voice is clear sometimes but most of the time cannot hear anything. The connection isn't good at all. Call dropped happened without listening anything but credit is taken. First day, I recommended my friends to use this app but later told them not to use it. 09/03/2020 I contacted with customer care two times with two different issues. They told that they solved it. I found everything okay but later same is happening. I am waiting to finish my credits.",
      "I almost didn't install this app as a result of a few bad reviews I red earlier. It's really not what they have described it. At last, it's working awesome for me. Calls were all clear. I hope you first of all install and give it a trial before you conclude.",
      "Had to pay to make international calls. Which I was willing to do. Come to find out rather than going to the person's device and calling them directly...they recieve the calls in WhatsApp which we already use. The purpose was to not have the call be as unclear as Facebook and WhatsApp calls. So basically I paid for this app to make a call through-to a different app. Total Scam. Waste of time and money."

You wont notice.",
      "Absolute garbage! I also used Psiphon on different PCs, it may \"hide\" your IP but at the cost of your internet speed taking the hit to the point its nearly dial-up. Even their pay-for-speed \"booster\" option does absolutely nothing. Contacting them is pointless, they do not respond. Tried other VPNs and there's no comparison - the worst VPN service - ever. Now that I know what to expect, there's no incentive to buy any service from this company.",

I request you to add Russian server and improve the stability of this app. Still this app is far better than others and you can trust on it. But please add Russian server.",

      "This app is fantastic. It is the best email client I have ever used or likely will ever use. However, since I have been using this app it has been shut down, turned back on, and now shut down again. I paid $50 a year to have access to this apps services and each time it has been shut down and I don't even know why. I love Newton, but I can not longer recommend it. I can't point people to this app of it will just be shut off once they sign up. I'm honestly sorry to see it go though.",
      "Update 3/7/20. Still the best Android email app I have used! I am very sorry to see it go away but maybe it will be rescued again like the last time it shut down. Original review. Best email app I have tried on android. It's a shame that the app is shutting down. It was supposed to be canceled at the end od September but it is still working fine.",
      "This application and its predecessor have been my primary email app for a few years now, while I've temporarily left to try almost every other service available. This is the best of them all and is worth the subscription fee, in my opinion. It does the best job of reliably syncing changes to the server and handles every email service. Suggestion: the option to put the toolbar (delete, archive, move buttons) on the bottom of the screen would be great, especially with larger phones.",
      "5 Star at the moment. Never understood how a quality product with talented developers can go \"belly up\", twice. Best email app I've ever used and appears than I'm not the only one. Willing for the \"charm\" time, but afraid perception will \"bums rush\" the factual product. Come on guys/gals put your big boy pants on and seize the day.",
      "Great App, but it's shutting down again. Essential Inc. announced it's out of business and taking Newton Mail down with it (shuts down April 30, 2020). I can't say I'm surprised, but I am really disappointed. This probably answers the questions and concerns that people have been posting the last 30-60 days in reviews here. I guess it was good while it lasted."

      "I love this app and have been using it for years. I especially like the ability to customize notification sounds for different incoming numbers. I would give this app a 5 star if I could figure out how to react to messages with a mood. --- Replying to Handcent: I have tried the long press, but I do not see that option. My phone is over two years old, so I wonder if that could be the issue. Is there possibly a setting that needs to be changed for this to work?",
      "Excellent. Been using this app for years now. Had a problem with Avast flagging it as a virus. Contacted customer service. They were very helpful. They contacted me back straight away. They have spoken to Avast. And the problem was sorted out in no time. No problems at all now. Excellent customer service. Would definitely recommend this app.",
      "Love this app! I've used it for years. I love the how easy it is to customize. However I just spent the last hour trying to figure out why my notification sound wasn't making a sound. I was trying everything until I clicked on something & it took me to the google play store, I saw an update was available. I read the items that were updated & saw the 1st one was fixing the no notification problem. I did the update & bingo all is working now. My favorite feature is the delay in sending a text!",
      "Great feature-set and absolutely top notch support! After upgrading to Android 10, I had all kinds of issues with every text messaging app I was trying out. Handcent was quick to respond and to resolve the problem. Between personalized notifications, customizable themes and the private box, this has everything I need, plus the peace of mind of reliable support.",
      "I've been using this app for many years across many phones. I thought maybe it would be my new phone's battery (Galaxy S10). However it turns out this app is eating up almost 8% of my battery just being idle, according to my battery usage graph. That's just Insane. My phone battery is about just as bad as my previous phone after 4 years of use. I truly enjoy using this app but this battery usage issue Seriously Needs to be resolved. Please fix this. I would very much like to rate this 5 stars."

If the developer can make it clear on reading the bars, it would be so much helpful. The hyperbole data shows clear feedback on the length of the WhatsApp's usage. This app is recommended. Thanks developer!",
      "Around 10 days working good, poor UI, very limited options, but works.. more than a day ago, app stopped working, not a single reply or update from developer, good luck getting people to pay you for nothing, cancelled subscription, which is not cheap, still worth it. Not anymore... I wonder why Google is letting developers run away with 20 days of my money for no service or at least a single explanation or status update. Isn't this upsetting ? \"subscription from Dartima LLC on Google Play will be canceled on Dec 30, 2019. No refunds will be issued\"",
      "Installed it before going to bed. Woke up to see how well it worked, only to learn that the trial period had ended. So, who knows if this app really even works? The part where it requested you pay money seems to work fine. How freaking stupid could a company be to revolve their modus operandi solely around money without building value in their product?",

It blocks us from seeing what we are typing and makes any typing within puffin very annoying. Been complaining for months.",
      "I was using Puffin free version for a long time to play flash games and now that you can't play on the free version I decided to go ahead and pay for this one and guess what ? Still can't access the flash theater to play so will be deleting both versions! !",
      "Really like this app wish they would allow us more customization options over the virtual gamepad ,such as transparency options and additional buttons, if that was possible would be top notch.I mostly use puffin to play my favorite flash games on my phone and I hope they don't neglect any opportunities to improve upon it",
      "STILL can't use flash properly. What's the deal? Why does it keep snagging like that? I paid for this app and expect to be able to use it normally. The thing you tout as your best feature doesn't work properly.",

      "It's a helpful app for making a throwaway account on a website or something that you don't know if it will send spam to your main email, but with temp mail you can see that it spams that temporary email and you can just move on and get a new one. Much easier then making a new email yourself Everytime, and with premium I hear that you can pick what you want your email to be, and you can hold multiple inboxes at once, that is a premium ability though, but they do have to make their money back.",
      "Awesome for avoiding spam, I don't use advanced features but when I site requires an email this keeps them from flooding my personal inbox with junk. It's nice you can receive mail on this app when something needs email verification. Been using for about a year and still like it.",
      "I bought the pro version that no longer works because you guys want to charge a monthly subscription. I already paid 14.99 for the pro version this is ridiculous",
      "The app keeps spamming for premium. If I wanted to be spammed, I wouldn't be using a throwaway email app.",
      "No complaints about the applications function but without purchasing the premium service do not plan any long term use as a constant usable email"

None of these were clear at the beginning of the registration. Then I received a notification saying that my registration is \"suspicious\". They asked me to try again later. I gave up.",
      "Fantastic app, been using for many years, after switching to it from QQ. But, since two or three months ago, it keeps switching off automatically. Everytime I use it and I exit to use other things, the closes down. So everytime i enter it, it restarts from scratch. And also, it stops giving notifications: no sounds, no message display, no red icon. I can only see if I got a message if I open the app. I have updated it last month, but the problem was not solved . What do you suggest?",
      "Requires lots of memory, requires lots of permissions to your phone (the impression is - you give them all your identity). A few times I stuck in the jungle of Asian letters... When I tried to log-in for a second time, I forgot my password and tried to log-in with SMS code. Although everything was correct from my side, I've got the message that my account was blocked! Without no reason! And - if I want to unblock it, I need a friend with an account that's older than 6 months and bla-bla... I will never use this app again or recommend it to anyone."

      "Used to be Ad supported, now just tries to force you to buy the £18/year subscription. No mention of this change in the description. Still says you can use flash free with ads, which you can't. Very misleading. No reason to use this browser. Uninstalling.",
      "So bad!!! Im curious if this is actually works in flash games, I saw in youtube that it's working so I download it, but when I do what they say in the video(tap the lightning icon and tap the continue with ads), this photon flash keeps pushing me to buy the premium version and there's nothing I can do about it.",

I am a paying customer, and for several years now. Customer service and customer support is horrid. If the folks at Contacts+ are reading this review and are interested in helping me, great.

      "Not a free app as advertised. You have to choose a payment plan of min Rs 420 per month to even use it. You give the app all your information to sign up and then cannot go ahead without payment. Uninstalled it immediately. I hate these apps which promote fake information.",
      "Seems that you have to pay £4 a month for you as parent then the same for each of your kids, in my case that would be 16 month simply far too much. I'm response to response from developer, what you say may be worth considering and I saw the 3 day trial, however I had to select a subscription plan for my user on each device before I could get a trial, and there was no mention about any types of a count being free or any family plans. I even sent to your website. Please send a link to informatio",
      "I love this app. my daughter has my husband's old phone/note that's she can use around the house with wifi or at a friend's house to call us. the one thing that is bothersome is that it is registered to my husband's phone number and that means only her and I have it. he can't have it.",

      "Don't waste your time paying for this app. You have to turn it back on every 3 hours. If it was once ever 12-48 hours that would make more sense. At this rate, it will take someone almost two years to recover the cost of the app. Why didn't I just buy some Bitcoin with it instead and stop wasting my time? It's not worth the money, use the free version and just buy Bitcoin if you don't want to deal with having to turn mining back on every 3 hours.",
      "A good start. Having to click the blue button every 3 hours is a little bit annoying but I guess there are reasons to keep the user engaged with the app. my suggestion would be to offer a gold option or a Premium app version of this. charge a little bit more and then the user doesn't have to keep clicking it. For a one hundred percent autopilot version, I would pay a little more for that, for sure. Otherwise keep up the good work is a pretty cool app 😎",
      "CryptoTab Browser Pro is the absolute BEST. There is no comparison.. If you have active referrals and if you can mine with them, you will always earn a passive income. They always pay and they are trusted and professional. They have paid me several times and I will continue to use CryptoTab until I die or until there is no more bitcoin in this world to mine. Thank you CryptoTab for your awesome service and I wish you the most success as well as much success for my fellow bitcoin entrepreneurs.",
      "This is based on my own opinion. I think it is worth it (4.5$) because of these reasons: ( btw my phone is Samsung Galaxy J5, Android 6 Snapdragon 410, 2gb ram, 8 gb memory) 1.The original CryptoTab Browser's mining speed on my phone is 10 - 13 h/s while the paid version which is CryptoTab Browser Pro is 320 - 335 h/s. 2.The mining speed of my laptop that is using CryptoTab Browser for Windows which is an Asus Windows 10, i3 8th gen processor, 4gb ram and 1tb memory is 97 - 125 h/s. Thanks.",
      "I love the app. And the concept of it producers, 3 star for now, though I have not withdrawn from the app for the first time but from the testimony of others you guys are guine. The part I don't like, is the annoying part of Enabling the boost every 3 hours please work on this part, More Grace."

      "Would be good to see more frequent updates for bug fixes and functionality. 2019 Ford Transit. Good overall but could use some refinement. Still can't see transmissions temperatures. The data through the app seems off as well. I can't get engine oil temp at all. It shows up red when I click on the config. Also the avg fuel economy is far too high for what I know I am getting. Upwards of 8 mpg higher in the app vs reality.",
      "Great product. I did have a hiccup when trying to perform an update but the support team walked me through how to get everything running. Very easy to diagnose and set error codes along with monitoring built in automotive readings. BTW, the device does not actually measure anything, just reports back what the car's sensors are reading.",
      "Does what I need it to do. Read codes accurately and clear codes. Have been very satisfied with my purchase. Came in very handy today when my check engine light came on and started flashing. Would not have wanted to chance driving to a store to scan for code. In this particular case, told me which cylinder was misfiring on my '08 Odyssey, which turned-out to be a fouled plug.",
      "Very good , glad I bought it. Regular updates. Easy download of info for car of specific year ( for free ). I was able to look into my car with the OBD II connected , then when I got near Wi-Fi it was easy to download the specific info on my car make and year. I like not having to pay for each download, Or firmware update. Fast data during download too. I don't have any thing bad to say about this. I give it a 5",
      "If you're like me and you just want to sit in your drive way and do everything a shop would cost you $40 to do this is your buy. I entered a little bit of info about my vehicle and downloaded a 3mb DLC it was Very very in depth many features in OBDlink app + 3rd party app support over all great buy, requires research to understand all features. The dashboard can be used for most PID's there is a feature for live graph feeds. No adds easy to connect mode 6 and 9 data, quick custom accurate!"

Long story short, I was required to install this to get to Dialer+, and that doesn't work on this phone at all. It isn't available to select in any menu, and launching Dialer+ from my app drawer results in an immediate crash, every time. As of 03-20-2020, this is not truly a dialer app, at least for my Blu G9 running android 9, updated to the latest version.",

I'm dubious about using as I can't afford to miss important calls, but I'll give it another try. Edit 2: Almost all photos now disappeared. Edit 3: Some photos restored, apparently at random, but some numbers (from Google contacts) now truncated. Bizarre. Edit 4: Now seemingly resolved all issues. I'll use guardedly.",
      "Is the app also available in other languages besides English? Now I set google account language in English to let match the labels within contacts etc. with app. But native language is another than English. And please, try the accessibility scanner of Google for finding accessibility issues: not all buttons and icons are labeled with text-based labels.",
      "New to this app. The app seems to be user friendly and includes a lot of features. The only thing I've issues about is that unknown numbers can be saved only to 'new contacts' , the option to save to the 'existing contacts' doesn't appears at all.",
      "One Big Glitch The app works great except that it cannot handle group texts. You think you're replying to the group and the app sends the response to one random person. I'm going to stop using it. Hopefully they fix the glitch."

After my friends playing Pubg game. when lift the call no problem but after cut the call opened App automatically. The game is collapsed. After all my friends uninstalled this application. So please fix the problem ASAP.",

When i will be 18, i will charge facebook in our court as a thief."

      "Recently moved and got a new PC And couldnt wait to use it, however I knew I would be dealing with using a mobile hotspot while I waited for my internet package to be installed. Not to my surprise(because this happened before)my at&t mobile hotspot data was slow, and also used up my data within a few hours, I needed much better service than this, but AT&T wants to make it difficult with their contracts to get good mobile hotspot service without paying alot. This app saved the day! Works well!",
      "First off, thanks to the author for creating amd maintaining this app! 1) Premium definitly removes speed caps as the author states 2) As a software engineer, I can definitely say this stuff takes time to build and maintain. If this works for you kick in! 3) Allthough there is more to setup then just turning on wifi, it is easier then connecting to your corporate VPN. There is no way to avoid this extra setup in android without rooting and customizing your kernal. This app automates a whole series of things I needed to do from a shell on my phone before (things only an IT professional would be familiar with). Serious time saver! Only request: Would it be possible to allow for fully custom SSID and password? Thank you again for your hard work. Enjoy your Coffee!",
      "An excellent app and an excellent developer behind it. It works very well - and without any nonsense or hidden gimmicks. The documentation is very thoughtful, with a clear focus on enabling the user to comfortably set everything up.",
      "This app was very easy to set up and very reliable, but when the trial ended i felt like the developer needed a fancy coffee. The app is great for what it says it will do but the downsides to this are that you have to pay to remove the throttle and changing the wifi name isn't straight forward - it says it doesn't work on all devices but since i have the newest samsung galaxy (s10) i would assume that it should work. I would (and did) recommend this to friends.",
      "I am updating my review. Recently the limited hotspot my phone provider he's been completely mobilizing my signal causing buffering during live TV streams on my fire stick. If I didn't have this application I wouldn't be able to provide the full speed internet I need to stream TV. No buffering ever. Honestly if I could rate this application a 10 I would do . If Having trouble connecting try repeatedly optimising your phone while Wi-Fi is connecting until Connected w/problems. > Connect to tether"

An application that I paid for shouldn't work like this. 1 star till this is fixed. I have this bug for more then a year... It makes the app fully useless...",
      "This app allows you to securely communicate with friend with good server, data usage depends on bitrate being set to specific channel and audio quality is pretty decent but I want to see some of the PC version features like: being able to disable microphone so you don't have to disconnect in order to record something else like Instagram story, also I would like to see internal echo reduction for unprocessed audio so we can maybe listen to music while talking, and also rework settings for look 😊",
      "First bought on an iPhone 7 years ago. Have it now on my Android phones. Still randomly crashes after 10 seconds after entering a server, and my phone needs to be restarted to get the application to run again. Just like old times. Added a star because it at least lets people know I left the office.",
      "Wow the app is totally a mystery in how to use it. There is the voice that keeps informing you of activity but the volume is so low you can not hear unless the spraker is to your ear. No way to find a channel you might be interested in as far as I know. No help guides to look at so gurss better go online to try to find something. Hope it works good and I can figure it out. People seem to use it on there network rsdios."

      "Not working on a 1997 suburban k1500. Bought it to set the CAM Retard on my distributor and when I try to connect it says \"Auto Scan. No PIDS are Supported!\" I tried several times and on two different phones and no luck. Really don't want to have to take it into the shop to get the distributor set at 0° but I don't know what other app supports CMP Retard for older GMC vehicles. Update: They emailed me and they informed me it won't work on my vehicle and issued a refund.",
      "I could not buzz test my 2001 Ford Diesel with other apps, but it worked well with this application. I wish there were more details on how to use the various features, but it is a great application.",
      "Purchased to diagnose a P0272 on a 6.0 Excursion. Tried doing the buzz test multiple times, and the app repeatedly fails after first injector with an Unknown Error. Does the same thing on my 2004 6.0 F250. I was willing to look past the clunky interface if the buzz test worked. Very disappointed.",
      "Getting \"java.io.ioexception: bt socket closed\" error on my galaxy note 8 and I tried everything I could but it wont connect. I spent $60 on a good bluetooth OBD II reader so I could use this app to do an injector buzz test on my 96 f250 7.3 powerstroke. Stupid app will not work on my phone. Hey developer, update this junky app. Charge $8.99 and you haven't updated it in nearly 5 years. You wasted my time and money.",
      "I downloaded this to my galaxy s10 to buzz test my 7.3. Was notified it wasnt up to date with the current android os and I could not get it to connect to my bluetooth obdii."
