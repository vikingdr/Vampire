And my chat list isn't loading. It happens to me every day and resetting end reinstalling isn't working. Fix this Facebook. It's annoying. 🙄 It started 3-4 weeks ago.",
      "Text works great. But when I call people it seems like the voice and video calls don't always work here in Cleburne TX. When I call people on the other side of the world it works fine but here in my town the calls don't always go through or get dropped or bad quality. Maybe the internet availability needs improvement in my town.",
      "Messenger recent update is bugged and I have tested it already on all 3 devices of mine, both android and iOS. Whenever I am trying to share something through messenger (be it a YouTube video, a photo, or an audio clip I have recorded in my phone's internal app), it will only pull up the Messenger app as if I am not sharing anything!!",
      "messenger sucks anymore.....have not been able to share and send articles to my friends as I did before, by clicking on share, then messenger and then name used to come up and I would click send next to their name, but will not and has not done for three going on four days today and do not know why! Is there something wrong with messenger? Can you please fix this problem and asap, thanks!"

      "Very useful app. But still there is a security issue. Because, anyone who is an admin of any group, can add any number without their permission. Instead I have a suggestion that, if a group admin needs to add a number to that group, then the owner of that number should receive a message to opt \"YES I am interested to join\" or \" NO I am not interested to join\". This will ensure more individual security. Hope you will update the changes. Thank you.",
      "Not the best instant messaging app but the most popular, which pretty much forces one to use it, and it's decent, especially now that it has a dark mode, save for the fact that we still can't edit messages to fix mistakes, or that we can't select messages and press the text bar to quote them like before, not even as an option. Two things to be added that'd greatly improve the app.",

Please fix this issue/bug, i use this app every day to keep in contact with friends and family. I have notified support but no help",

A lots of pictures I can share with my clients easily. Easy conversation. Calls quality is good Video call feature is also nice. Overall this is very useful application for anyone and easy to use....",
      "Before the start of 2020 WhatsApp was the best social App ever created. However, since the start of the year, I'm not sure what changed but it went from a 10 star to a 1 star. Video calls are poor and voice calls are worse. You talk for a few minutes then the person on the other cannot hear you. At 1st I thought it was temporary but this has being going on steady for months."

      "Great idea needs work. While in the app it lists some of my kids contacts but not all of them. It also does not open chat heads or give any kind of notification when someone sends a message while you aren't on you don't know I have multiple kids so as a parent it's frustrating trying to manage their accounts. If I manage one it signs me into theirs as them and then won't let me sign out to check on another ones account. I had to uninstall and reinstall. It has lots of potential but needs work.",
      "I love how this app is helping my kids stay connected with their friends during the shelter in place. I don't like that the tablet constantly rings when my young son is trying to take a turn playing on the tablet & there is no way to turn it off temporarily or put it on silent. When it has been ringing & you open the tablet the app automatically opens, I don't like that. You can set a sleep mode but \"weekends\" are Friday and Saturday & \"weekdays\" are Sun-Thurs, I need M-F after school hrs.",

If you guys just edit these things, it would probably be the best messaging app for kids, and for me.",
      "SO AMAZING! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHAT WITH PEOPLE JUST BY ENTERING A CODE! Just enter a code and boom! You can now chat with another person! It's that easy! There is some ads but they never occur when you are chatting or typing! You can even see when someone sent a message just by CLICKING THE MESSAGE!!!!I rated this five stars for a reason! DOWNLOAD NOW!!!",
      "Ehhh. It's not horrible and all but the thing that aggravates me is that you can't name people different names. Example: I want to name my friend '' bff '' but it won't let me only unless we're in a group with a bunch of people I'd really appreciate it if you fix that. Also, I'd like them to make it look more like fb messenger when you get on the main menu it just looks weird... and when you video chat people I wish you could see them with a full screen otherwise 5 star rating."

Unfortunately, that now means (according to Microsoft customer service) that my phone number can never be associated with my account, even if the accidentally-created account is deleted. One little mistake on my end that any other business would be able to fix now means that this app is less than useless for me. :/",
      "This is a very bad application, I installed this application 5 month ago, they asked for a credit card information. I used if a few days and the App says the first month is free. After that few days I didn't use it anymore but they have charged me for 4 month. They didn't send any in-app notifications for charging or emails, despite the fact that they have already the email. On the other side , the settings is a complicated one and you can't find where to go for cancellation.",
      "This is a great app, since I started using Android phone, I have used Skype since then and the best thing about it is video and audio are very clean, which gives good quality, I like it. By using its app and I will always be in touch with it and I hope that things will come up on the sky better and the process will work and on the sky is the very good app,",
      "Terrible - This app does not work on my android tv box. Skype has downloaded but will not allow me to reach the sign in page. A pop up error message suggests checking my internet connection but there is nothing wrong with my WIFI or Ethernet connections. I guess I'm going to be even more socially distant from my family than planned.",
      "They eat up the money you load after a while. They send you email saying if you do not log in, you will loose your credit. If you miss to log in, it totally disappear. There is no way of talking to someone or getting an email address to send message. You are going looptiloop for hours on their site and find no way to contact them."

      "I love discord, and use it every day. But the only complaint I have is the changes (currently) to the appearance on mobile. It doesn't entirely make sense? And it feels uncomfortable. Like swiping left to see the members in a group now has that overly large box. Likewise with servers. I'm aware you put the pins and such there, but why? There wasn't entirely a reason it seems, I've never seen anyone complain about it. It was easier to navigate without having a large box covering the chat.",
      "I love this app on my phone and computer. Excellent for connecting with gamer friends!! I could go on and on about how much I use and love this app, but I just want to write my one compliant about it. My only issue with Discord is the infamous \"robot voice\" that people get occasionally. Besides that, excellent job Discord! Also, thank you for being free :)",
      "Hello Discord, I don't really have any problems with it. Chat, call, make your own group chat or even video call. You can really do everything on Discord, but there is one thing that sticks out to me, that is... Friends list, it does it in a sort of, weird way, it puts group you've made and not in the groups list, but it's a good way to chat with friends.",
      "I love it, really. There is a vast number servers to explore and join (you can make your own server/s too) and so many people to meet and/or make friends on there. The only issue that I had though, is that it wouldn't notify me at times when someone has messaged me, but other than that, my overall experience on this app has been great thus far😄😁",
      "This app can be a masterpiece when it actually wants to, but honestly it seems like it doesn't even try. There's always some problems, either i can't hear other people or they can't hear me. Usually restarting the app does the trick, but not even that works anymore. Dissapointing. Please fix this, cause it could've been a 5 star rating."

      "Looooove Marco Polo. Love the ease to use the software, whether you're techy or tech-averse. The only thing I would like would be different filters. I'm sure that makes things more complicated or more difficult, but I hardly use the current ones cause they're pretty basic (and kinda lame [sorry]). Other than that feature lacking, I would have given them a 5 star.",
      "Love that I can connect with people I haven't seen in years!! I can watch the videos as they are talking to me or later. Really love that it reminds me if i have a message I haven't watched yet! Especially now its great for my kids to use to stay in touch with their cousins since traveling is a no go with covid-19.Haven't had any problems at all and been using it for 4 months now.",
      "Actually love the concept, but it sent texts to people in my contacts, which I cant have happen. I have a lot of my customers and coworkers in there, so had to delete account. I get it's trying to spread its name, but I would have actually told people about it, if they didn't do that. Edit: The app developers worked with me to explain how to disable the contact permissions, but still be able to use the app. Thank you!",
      "It is like having a fantastic conversation but on your own time. Even if your grandkids want to tell you something but you aren't available they can leave as long of a video conversation as they want and it is sent easily and quickly and can actually be watched and reacted to in REAL TIME! This simple app is a communication miracle !! So easy to use.. videos can be saved for later viewing or forwarded. LOVE IT!!!",
      "60% of the time the record feature doesn't work, says something went wrong, so I send a problem report each time. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, updated my phone, the app, and still won't work when I try to record. I've taken these steps several times and have to restart my phone every time I want to send a message to someone. It's the most frustrating messaging app I've ever used."

      "I used this app and I quite like it. However, there are flaws, when a friend sends a picture, sometimes it loads or shows a no image picture. Today I had a problem to where I was getting nonfictions but they did not show up in app. Please fix, then I will have five stars. Otherwise, clean, good, and useful for the time being. I also seriously appreciate the dark mode. And I essentially use the calling, I love it. Another annoying thing is that I can only show 15 second videos. Otherwise good! :D",
      "This is a great app. It REALLY does provide FREE long distance calling, WITHOUT having to earn credits! BUT, I have had THREE problems with this app; 1) Very often, I am not able to hang up, after dialing a number! 2) Quite often, after about two or three minues, the calls are cut off right in middle of my conversation! 3) There does not seem to be any technical support!",
      "Great App. I moved from the city to the mountains and couldn't get dependable reception. I was suggested this app and tried it out. It works perfect. As long as you have a WIFI signal you will be able to call receive calls text and pic message. I like it so much that I've upgraded to the $2.99 a month and plan and use this as a perment means of communication now.",
      "Meh, I had higher hopes for this app based on all the 5 star reviews, but was disappointed with my experience. Constant ads EVERYWHERE, sometimes multiple ads on one screen, and most of them take up half my screen, which is excessive, and beyond annoying. It frequently stalls on a solid black screen anytime I try to do anything, when u choose a contact it doesn't pick their default number, it picks the first number you added to that contact. Also, setting the background has never worked for me.",
      "It's a decent free text & calling app, which works over WiFi or Mobile Data equally well. I've also upgraded to premium, which improves the app's versatility, but the free service is a complete product without requiring it to be premium, like a lot of other text & calling apps out there. So, that being said, I bet you're like, \"He rated it 4☆ out of 5☆ though, what's the catch?\" The 4☆ rating is cuz to keep the same cell# from changing you must text or call at least once every 3 days or...poof!"

With that said there are a few really annoying issues holding this back from a higher score as of the time writing this. 1) You can't seem to add/invite people to an ongoing call. You have to exit the call, create a new group with all people, and the call that group. Really?!? 2) If you have a group call going and it dwindles down to two people it cuts the screen in half for each user instead of full screen with the person you are talking with and small thumbnail for yourself. Fix these two issues and this will be a 5 star app.",
      "I really want to like this app. It have good features, like the low light mode. It works great. But it lacks some fundamental features that it shouldn't. If i made a voice call, i couldn't req for a vid call immediately. I had to end call and call again. If i was in a vid call, i can't change to fon call, and i can't temporarily turn off the camera if i need to. If the other side ends the call, there is no tone to indicates the call was ended. Minor features, but fundamentally important.",
      "I have Duo installed on my android and am attempting to use it on my computer once in a while. When someone calls, it rings on the phone but does not ring on the computer. There is no notification that someone is calling, nor is there any way that alerts me so I can press \"answer\" and pick up the call. I added duo into my notifications on the web browser as the HELP menu instructed with no luck. What do I do next?",
      "Video seems to stutter & freeze much more than other apps like FB messenger or WhatsApp. This iccurs while communicating with others with good wifi at both ends. This forces us to move off Duo and into another app to communicate.",

Whenever I call anyone it just says immediately \"person didn't answer\". It only pops up the incoming call on the other end for about 1 second. The only way is to have them call me back to chat. Very annoying for someone who uses duo everyday. Please fix this Google!"

I have uninstalled three times in an effort to fix the problem but it's still not working. This is causing a huge disruption for me and there seems to be no technical support.",
      "Usually great, but since the latest update, the notification on my lock screen (and thus also when I unlock) keeps disappearing. It'll show up for a few minutes, but if I don't get to it fast enough or if I don't see it right away, it just goes away. I keep needing to go into the app to make sure I haven't missed texts.",
      "I really appreciate being able to have a second number that I can keep permanently for keeping my personal phone personal. I don't want everyone calling my cellphone; close friends, family etc yes! Business contacts, retail memberships, creditors, not at all. Nothing sucks more when trying to relax than some a-hole blowing up your phone. Got to love Google for this service! @ pthis price this service cannot be beat. Thanks Google Team!! Sincerely, Moe",
      "Cant give it a 5... works great so far, definitely notifies me when I missed a call and it went to voicemail, but I want to either extend the number of \"rings\" before it goes to voicemail, OR disable the voicemail feature and review my missed calls! Either option would be good, and allow me the time to get to the phone to answer it! I am not so young that it is attached to my hand, and it seems to go to voicemail very quickly. Please advise on either option that I would like to utilize!",
      "I've been using Google voice for a while now. I really enjoy having one phone number for everything. I'm not sure if I'm imagining this but it seems like I don't get very many spam calls to my number which is super nice. The search leaves something to be desired and the chrome plugin no longer works."

      "They are slowly killing this app. It used to work well, but functionality has been dying and I'm guessing it's a bit on purpose given that they have been trying to make other kinds of messaging apps. First, custom ringtones went away, now, there is no notification ringtone at all, just vibrate. It's sad as the functionality with desktop Gmail and the Google voice numbers just used to be great. There's less and less reason to use this.",
      "The app works fine and is a great way for me to contact and call my friends. The only problem is that I don't know how to change the ringtone. At first the notifications only came in as vibrations. Then I changed the notification sound back to normal, but the ringtone would be the notification sound looped. Could someone help me figure out how to change the ringtone back to normal? Thank you.",
      "I love this app for it's multi functionality, great all in one messaging app. It is too bad Google is not investing enough in Hangouts. Instead they went for some weird multiple single task apps like that Allo bs app none one is using anyways. Duo is not bad for video calls, but again the problem is that every one you want to contact and chat with must have all these messaging apps installed on there phones. And why the hell did they remove location sharing?",
      "Just not the same. It wouldn't make the noise anymore when I got a text. I'd be missing texts, and texts not sending. Did an update on my phone which updated the app, and now the names of my contacts aren't associated with their phone numbers. I have group texts and i don't even know who's sending what text because it shows the number instead of the contact. Wish I didn't update it now. Would like to know who's sending me texts, not the number.",
      "The latest update reset the ringtone from 'Hangouts Message' to 'App provided'. To restore 'Hangouts Message', go into Settings > [your account] > Notifications Messages > Advanced > Sound. Then use Media Storage to choose 'Hangouts Message' (or any other ringtone you want). NOTE: 'Settings' refers to settings within the Hangouts app, not the system settings."

      "I really like the general idea of this app. Its super cool......when the notifications work. I've tried EVERYTHING. I make sure theyre on for the chat, theyre on for the app, and theyre on for my phone and they STILL dont work. I think its a common problem because Ive heard other people complain about it.....and it really bothers me. And like on top of no notifications, when I look at the chat, it acts as if Ive already looked at it. So thats a real bummer :((",
      "I had multiple chat conversations disappear in November and they have remained missing ever since. I've tried numerous times to submit help tickets, but they either don't check their help desk or don't care, because all they can muster up is a note on their site saying \"don't worry, this issue is fixed,\" when it's really not the case. Disappointing.",
      "Pros: Like group texting, but only the gatherer needs your phone number. Profiles are maintained by participants, so icon and info are as complete as individual desires. Cons: Cannot delete conversations, only \"mute,\" so there's muted spam forever in my list of conversations. Cannot mark messages as read from notification; must enter app and load conversation. New notification for every single post, so constantly, constantly dings (17 new posts in a conversation = 17 new notifications); would be nice if only notified that a conversation updated. Uploading images can be iffy; different rates of success by very same methods.",
      "Great app for chatting with friends and connecting with peers that is cross platform. I often get a lot of bugs about messages not sending when they actually have, this problem has persisted across upgrading to a new phone, which lead to my 4 star rating. Small issue that is only a minor annoyance. Great app.",
      "The app for months now has been just terrible. It took me about 2 months to get in contact with support. I eventually had to ask Skype support to somehow contact GroupMe and fix my issue. This was the best app for awhile but since Skype/Microsoft bought it it's slowly gotten worse and worse messages don't go through and glitches are constant. It used to be only happen on my end with Android but is starting to affect friends with iPhones as well now. It needs an overhaul to be a 5 star again"

      "Frustrating. I have been a Yahoo customer since we first got email. It used to work fine. That hasn't been true for years, especially with the mobile app. Why does is take a full minute or more just to delete one or move one email. Frequently, a message saying unable to complete function appears. If it does happen to work at first, the emails reappear in my Inbox. I really don't like it at all. But, I've had it for long it's be too disruptive to change all of my accounts.",
      "While I use Yahoo mail a lot oh, I don't really understand the different versions of it. On my Android phone and my laptop with Windows 10, I use the app. It mostly gets the job done. But when I am taken to Yahoo mail from Craigslist for example, I'm replying to an ad, there's a version of Yahoo mail that is so much better. But I've never understood how to gain access 2 the Yahoo mail that has spell check built into it and graphically is much more rich and interesting.",
      "This ap is seriously flawed. Frustrating. It doesn't respond as intended. All the features are there. For instance, delete more than one email. I deleted emails,only for them to reappear..and now unresponsive.it flashes an awful lot. As though it wants to respond.. It's not as smooth either, as outlook. The one thing I appreciate, is being able to select more than one email..using *one button. That's where it stops. Whatever action i want to preform, doesn't appear to work.",
      "Very fast and organized for retrieval or back read. Before I had two alternating yahoo addresses. Strangely one was compromised. It had no messages to display in any folder. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Put back both. The second one is still compromised. Reinstalled and retained only the first one. Still satisfied. The other one I use yahoolite app but it's not as convenient.",
      "I cannot get into my email account all of a sudden. It keeps telling me it's \"initializing mailbox\" and then it eventually says its currently unavailable, and try again later. I've been trying for 2 days. I've uninstalled and then installed the app again. It keeps doing the same thing. I tried to create a new password and its telling me, basically, that I tried too many times and to wait 24 hrs. I'm expecting important emails and now I'm locked out! OMG, I'm so frustrated!"

      "Everything was fine until the recent update. This new \"tap right/left to move between media\" thing is really disturbing. Sometimes you just want to hide the text and for that you have to concentrate and make sure you tap on the middle of the screen. Also the fact that you can't view the account pictures in a full mode without the name, etc anymore is not good. Last but not least, I think there's some kind of glitchiness added to the app when navigating between pages. ببخشید که کُپ زدم😁",
      "Probably the best messaging app in existence. You can easily edit a message, turn texts into italics or bold, or delete the messages you sent on both sides (not just what you see). Stickers are free, the usage of GIFs are made convenient, and you can easily send multiple pictures in one big group without giving the other side hundreds of notifications. This is completely free and you can even access it from the computer.",
      "Very few times telegram works fine, but a lot of time, it keeps getting stuck at connecting. I am unable to view or open any new message in the app, even though I get the notification for new messages. When I click on notification, it opens telegram which is stuck on a connecting message on the top bar. I know its not due to my internet issue as I am able to browse internet in my browser at the same time. I tried to reinstall the app but it's now stuck on connecting on the phone registration.",
      "Not working with WiFi Hi Team, Since yesterday, I've been having this issue where messages cannot be sent if mobile phone is connected to the Wi-Fi. It works fine when connected to the mobile data. It's a great app for messaging, but this issue is really annoying. Whenever it's connected to wi-fi, the app says \"Connecting“ and I'm unable to send messages media. Multiple users have been facing this issue. It would be great if you could look into this issue and fix it asap.",
      "Having trouble with the app, tried to get it to work but put the passcode in wrong too many times as keeps saying 'too many attempts please try again later'. I've tried waiting a day and coming back and it still says the same thing. Also having the same issue when uninstalling and reinstalling the app to try again."

      "I have it and I use it, and I love it. However the only reason it's not my default messages app, is only because my samsung default app has \"Quick Response\". When I'm driving my taxi, it's nice that I can automatically send a message letting them know im not ignoring them... lol if you guys can get that on your app, I'd be in heaven. Great job tho, guys. It's a great app.",
      "I got this app in order to send/receive texts over wifi. Unfortunately, even after tinkering with it for several hours and reading a lot of troubleshooting articles, I was not able to get this feature to work. Needless to say, I'm disappointed and a bit irritated about the wasted time; I'm now going to uninstall this app and go look for one that actually works.",
      "Great app except it suddenly, without warning assigns default notification settings to every conversation, disregarding the global app settings. When I wipe the data and reconfigure anew it works great for awhile and then bam, all the conversations are back with default notification settings. I can't fix this without going into every conversation and changing the notification settings, one at a time, which is a big job. Thus, I can't use the app.",
      "Only issues I have are this app doesn't light up my screen when I get a text message like the stock one does, and the lack of customization options. I mean really Google? You can't add a few more lines of code to give some options for bubble colors and backgrounds? And I missed a couple texts because I ignored my phone when it dinged because the screen didn't light up till I figured that out. Love the ability to text from my Chromebook though, and it's the only reason I'm keeping it for now.",
      "I really like the functionality of the Google Messages app. However, a MAJOR shortcoming is the inability to automatically purge old messages either by message limit or by age. Since all messages are stored on your phone and not on Google's servers, ultimately the phone's memory use will become excessive - especially given the ability for Messages to send & receive large files and images with RCS. Short of deleting entire ongoing conversations with your contacts - which is rarely desirable - incredibly, there seems to be no other (easy) way to delete old messages except laboriously and manually! The omission of this basic function by Google is unthinkable! It's hard to imagine Google hasn't addressed this. Messaging apps with much less technical expertise and fewer resources than Google include an automatic purge function. Come on, Google, fix this!"

      "Everyone should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, PRIVACY and FAST. Firefox doesn't work. Works for maybe one or two sessions, then just won't respond to clicking on links, menu items, or even typing in addresses in the address bar. Tried with AND without extensions installed. Clearing storage is the only option to get it to work (temporarily) again",
      "This Android browser is really fast and has an option al tracking protection which was made together with Disconnect. This is one of the things which make it worth using it over chrome. But if you use a privacy friendly search engine on chrome (Qwant, Ecosia, DuckDuckGo) you're already a long way to better privacy 🙉 👍🏼. Also I'm really EXCITED about Mozilla going to implement DNS-over-Https (DoH) which will stop prying eyes from corporate DNS servers. I will be waiting for that feature 🥰.",
      "If you force stop an app, it may cause errors. Yeah basically accessing any site sometimes would have the browser stuck in loading until I force close it. Firefox is an old behemoth, I figure, and it's hard to squash all the bugs, but it's the browser I've stuck with for years. Keep up the good work, but really though, get the loading bug fixed, it's been like this for months.",
      "What Happened??? Firefox used to be awesome. Man it just slowed my phone down and would freeze alot then wouldn't scroll. Appearance is nice until you realize there is no Dark (Night) Mode and no themes. I hope its just in the middle of Construction or something cause I have always been a fan but please get this browser back in the game asap!! Chrome needs some competition but seems to be no contenders.",
      "I get random hangs and freezes on my OnePlus 7T. Sometimes, opening a link from an app will freeze the device for 10 seconds and Firefox fails to even launch. Even with no background apps this can still happen. I'm not really sure what's going on but I'm switching back to chrome for the time being."

      "Does a good job. Had a problem hooking it up. I bought a resistor and installed it everything works but by original door bell. Update 3/22/20: Still working pretty good. It's a little slow sometimes. I haven't figured out why yet. My Wi Fi connection is ok. Sometimes it doesn't tell me when someone is on my porch. But hopefully I will figure it out. Still worth the money so far.",
      "It mostly works. There is a good delay even when I'm at home on my wifi. I can next to never catch a live view when I (used to) get notifications someone was outside. Even when they ring my doorbell I couldn't live view, it would just take forever to load. The past two weeks-ish I have also not been getting notifications. I wish there was an alert when battery was at 10% or less. I just don't check my emails enough to notice right away if it's low on battery.",
      "Terrible app and experience. Since a week now, I haven't been receiving notifications on my phone, and if I do they come like 3 minutes later, which by then it's too late to even bother answering the door. The App has not been functioning. It freezes or at the logo screen, or after loading up the interface (without it even connecting to the camera). The camera also doesn't detect movement all the times which defeats the purpose of it. I've reinstalled the app 5 times already, without luck...",
      "Never would be able to catch anyone in the act. Takes forever to load live video. Get a notification, click on it to view, then sit and wait for it to \"activate device\" and then load video. By that time, nothing is happening. Video also glitches every time. Video quality is okay, when it's working. Now I can't even view the live view. Starting to get ridiculous.",
      "I've only had this thing for maybe 5 months now. It's getting worse and worse. It's not only seizing up the app from being able to see things live as they're happening, now it's freezing my entire phone to where I have to turn it off and back on to get it to keep working. I have Xfinity internet and a Samsung Galaxy 9 plus, so I don't believe it's my equipment. Smh. Making me want to find another doorbell company. This is very frustrating."

      "What I am the most disappointed in is that the ability to search contacts is now only restricted to within the contacts app. If used to be that we could start typing contact names in the Google search bar from the home screen, that was by far the most used search feature. This restriction really impedes the fluid use of the contacts app. Unfortunate.",
      "I love Google contacts. I can block people that annoy me. I love that! I have options on who to save my contacts to. I always save my contacts to my Google Gmail account. That way I'll never loose those contacts. Google also keeps my contacts from previous phones Ive owned. I have the option to restore those contacts any time I need to.",
      "Google contacts is a awesome app, through this app you can save your contacts on your Google account, and the a main thing I observed is if you save a contact on your Google contacts app is automatically save that particular number on the device memory.... This really helps a lot and thank you guys (GOOGLE) for creating such a great and useful app... I really appreciate your work.",
      "Inconsistent. Seldom finds either of my two printers. One printer is connected through Wi-Fi while the other one is connected through hard wire to the same wireless access point. Neither printer is a problem when printing from other devices, but this app routinely tells me the printers are unavailable.",
      "Buggy notes Section. I rely heavily on note taking for each contact. For years I have used the notes section. Until recently, it has worked flawlessly. Now whenever I tap on the Note section it jumps me down to the bottom. It makes it impossible to cut & paste things like account numbers from my notes to elsewhere. I can no longer do that. I have to copy the entire notes section. Further, taking notes is near impossible. I can't see when entering new notes at the top. More stars when fixed."

      "Writing this review with my LIMITED DATA because of how useless this app is. It shows you where hotspots are... Using internet that you're not connected to. It doesn't actually connect you to WiFi, just shows you where hotspots are. I try to login to XFINITY or xfinitywifi and it says my \"link expired\" even though I'm using the app, within range, and have an active Comcast account. It doesn't make any sense. This is a waste of space. Do NOT recommend.",
      "Sometimes it work, but mostly not. I keep getting kick out when on XFINITY wifi, or not able log in at all. I do notice that it won't let me download security profile on Android but on Apple it's no problem. I have the MObile and Home Internet plan and still getting cap on Data . Also, when I'm connected on xfinity wifi 2 minutes later it will ask me to sign in again and download this app even though I still have the app running. This really annoying and developer should fix this.",
      "This app used to be pretty legit, now it's garbage. I'm never connected to a hotspot when I'm away from home and I have to log in multiple times a day now because there is no remember me box. Plus if I click view in browser it shows me somewhere near New York, NY...I live in Denver Colorado...That's what, 1600 miles away....",
      "So this app worked before. Don't know if there has been a recent update or if the recent pandemic and xfinity's offering of free service for 60 days due to COVID-19 is affecting this, but I can't even access the Wi-Fi around me as I get a message stating my link has expired and I need to sign into the hotspot app. Then upon signing into hotspot app I can't connect to a hotspot...",
      "Seems to work great so far as well as typically there has been hot spots most areas ive been.in and around Houston but none outside of Houston. The only thing that seems to need to tweaked is, I will be in the same place for 2 -4 hours and the signal is strong, but for some reason it will kick me off the network for no reason so I have to constantly log back in every 20 - 45 min."

      "Easy and simple to put in prepaid card,tells you your data usage overall. I hope for a hotspot usage bar to be implemented. Rewards program is alright but like any of the programs, they will take a while before you truly can use it to get something. The wheel thing is an interesting idea but anyone I know that spins it don't get anything,but then again its something that past my time when I was bored so I don't mind. Btw being able to put cards on reserve is awesome great feature.",
      "I have had nothing but trouble trying to add airtime to my phone online for several months now. I have contacted and told straight talk several times about the problem but they continue to ignore it. I literally have to physically go to the store and buy a new card and reactivate my phone every month. If that is as inconvenient for you as it is me then you may want to consider other options.",
      "No matter how hard I try, I cannot get my rewards. I have been with Straight Talk since 2011 and have not been able to do this. In all these years, I should have many reward points by now, but cannot access them.I've tried everything and am very frustrated with the results.",

Now with this dam illness going around they can't fill my phone. But O have been scammed with my phone numbers being passed out.",

      "It's been a very great app for me for several years, five stars to me, but after a certain recent update, it just freezes at random now, and sometimes I have to do a battery pull because it'll freeze my entire device during use as well. When Signal messes up but does not freeze my entire device, I check running apps and it's hogging a half a gig of RAM and hogging all 4 cores of my device's CPU, and I have to force-close it. And there have been other times it didn't receive messages (SMS and Signal) because I didn't realize the app was messing up at the time. Or I'll find my device is suddenly dead, and when I power it up and check what apps have recently used how much battery, it shows Signal was what drained it. It's like the app is getting caught in some sort of stupid infinite loop, and I wished I could explain what causes it to help you pinpoint it, but there's no rhyme or reason when it does act up. I mean, I work in I.T., I get it that things act up, and I learn to live with it, but on the other hand, I also NEED this to \"just work.\" If this issue keeps up after the next couple of updates then I'll have to turn to something else.",
      "Great App! I have been using Signal for about a couple of years now. I have had a few problems with it some messages not going through until later. But they have since have fixed that bug. Now, it's great. Flawless. I feel safe when using this app. I feel that my messages are going through with no problem. I feel that I can feel safe with nobody trying to hack my messages! So, give Signal a chance. You will be glad that you did!:)👍",
      "Great communicator, true end to end encryption. Call quality better then WhatsApp. It has some minor issues, but nothing what I would be worried about. I believe it will be fixed in future updates. The best I used so far. Group chat is not encrypted as far as I know, but neither other communicators offer that. I would be happy if there is no need to refresh signal's contact list when you add new contact to system's contact list. Didn't notice any other problems.",
      "It looks OK and sends messages OK. A big BUT though.. Notifications randomly stop. This happened before so I stopped using it. It works fine for a few days after I install it, but then it's stops notifying of a new message. I have no clue someone has messaged me until, by sheer luck, I happen to open the app and up pops a notification! By my reckoning, this makes the app pretty useless.",
      "Everyone should use this. Feature packed, even has a desktop application. End-to-end encrypted, truly the only electronic way to securely communicate. Open source, so 3rd parties can and have looked through the code to make sure it's secure, or even improve the app. I just wish there was a way to synchronize regular SMS messages with Android's native SMS database."

      "Upgraded my phone and now it's hit an miss if the app launches. Typically I see a splash screen with a lock but the app seems to hang there. Tried different resolutions, uninstall/reinstall but still have the same issue. Tried contacting support however it seems to be an auto responder with some suggestions only, the last of which is have your admin file a ticket with them. This doesn't seem to be a technical issue but a dev issue. I'm sure if it would launch it would work.",
      "If the app is killed soon after using the one time key and before the timer expires, then the next session (even after a few days) will still display the old one time key for whatever remaining seconds from old session. I was able to use same key thrice on three different days. Believe this needs fixed to ensure the old key gets expired soon after the app is killed.",
      "Update: app updated a couple hrs after this review. No more airplane mode warning. 🙂 My employer is using this as their MFA tool starting next week, and I can't get past the prompt to disable Airplane mode and reboot the phone. I'm on Android 10 which appears to be the problem based on other reviews. I'd expect a company like RSA to be more responsive about this, esp when a major OS upgrade is involved. Sad. 🤬 I hope this gets resolved soon.",

      "It's a great app that lets you talk to friends on PSN and is much easier than going and turning on your PlayStation just to chat. Though I would ask that you guys please add a couple features like PSN chat rooms and video/voice chat other than just messages. Also with messages where it shows the time sent and received, it's very buggy, I'll send a message and it'll say a random completely different time. For example I'll send a message at 10:00 pm and it'll say 9:43 am or something like that.",
      "It's a great app. Use it all the time when I don't feel like turning my PS4 on. I would suggest it if you have a newer phone. I have a LG Stylo 5, and it works perfectly. I had a LG Stylo 4+,( Just like a year difference between manufacturing ) and I would open the app, and it would cause my phone to shut down, turn on, freeze, and restart. So, if you plan on getting this app, get a newer phone. But in all, a very great app.",
      "2 stars because the app does work but for a while now my messages would disappear and not how on here or console anymore. when I would delete the app my messages still don't appear. Edit: after getting in contact with the playstation support staff everything does seem to be working properly now.",
      "The only thing you can do in this app is send messages. I really don't understand why the chat feature wasn't implemented in the PlayStation app. This way you need to install both the messages app and the PlayStation app because you can't do basic stuff like sending or accepting friend requests or viewing other peoples profiles in this app since the app forces you to install the PlayStation app to do those things.",
      "This app is very useful, but when it comes to performance, it sucks. there is a bug where you don't get messages or send messages. this happens to me at least once a day and it's very annoying cuz I have to restart my phone to fix it. so I'm saying it's a solid 5 star of they fix that bugs or other small ones."

I have been sending reports and messages for weeks now to no avail. I don't want to go through the trouble of closing my email account and go to another service, I JUST WANT YOU TO FIX THE APP!!! Hopefully, SOMEONE will see my post and are kind enough to respond!!!",
      "I use gmail all the time but I noticed on this update before last that it took away the ability to resize images, at this time when we are more isolated from each other it would be good to be able to reduce the size of pictures to share with friends and family. I used to be able to send over 10 pictures at a time and in sequence, now its max 6 and all over the place.... any chance we could have the resize element back??",
      "I love Gmail. But it never deletes my spam when I tell it to. My emails come thru late. I have to pull the screen down to make it sync. Even though I keep my account clear of old emails and constantly delete anything that I'm done reading. I'm still having problems. So I have to uninstall all updates and reinstall the app weekly. Just so it works properly for a few days.",
      "gmail now crashes no matter what fix I apply. Also...I've lost the ability to make this the default, or to default to another email app so I can open my hyperlinks. Every time I click a link it crashes and I never changed my settings. This update is the worst one ever. I'm switching everything off of Chrome, because I live and work by my email. I cannot function! And yet...ALLL of my emails are GMAIL! I want a divorce. After 3 weeks of complaints, you would think someone would get the message.",
      "Something weird has been going on with my gmail Android app for some days. It does not open. Absolutely nothing happens when I click on the App button except a totally blank white screen with only the + sign for new email on the bottom right. I have no idea what to do. Please help me, Gmail is essential for my work. Update: Fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling all updates. Leaving this review here for the record."

      "I really would like to use it as my primary browser, but the loading bar seems to get stuck at around 10% when trying to go to a page. It will eventually load, but the delay is very irritating. Chrome does not do this. If that is fixed I would continue to use it. Edit: I can mostly replicate the issue when searching from the address bar- default search is set to Google. The loading bar sits at around 10% for maybe 30 seconds then eventually loads the search results. Does not happen every time.",
      "I would like to congratulate Microsoft for making their browser not suck. It still has a few things that could be improved on but I am very impressed by how much more useful it is. (Still not gonna search with bing. Sorry) gonna switch the default browser in my computer too. Thank you for listening to criticism from many people and taking actions to improve the browser.",
      "The browsing experience on this sleek, beautiful, easily customizable new interface is delightful. The bookmark manager on the mobile version is weird enough, better than the one on the Windows version. What I'd really love is to have more third party extensions (esp. anti-tracking ones). I enjoy using Edge for light reading/browsing on my mobile device, the sync works great & fast, but it still has some catching up to Firefox on the adds-on front to be my default cross platform browser.",
      "I want to like it, but its not quite there. Two main problems for me: 1) It's too slow to be usable. The progress bar just sits about 10% of the way, then eventually it loads the page. This is nothing to do with my connection, other browsers are fine. 2) Frequently visited sites is a useless feature. Speed dial chosen by the user would be much more helpful (this is not favourites). Back to Opera for me.",
      "This Edge is so much better than the original Edge. Before the original edge came out, I was exclusively an Internet Explorer user. But when Edge came out, I was disappointed, this caused me to switch to Chrome. But now that the new Edge is out, I can safely say that the new Edge is my browser of choice. Good job, Microsoft."

Now I can only change the font to a specific font choice and the color blends into the background of the list. I cant tell who's messege I am opening! Why do you guys gotta mess with what wasnt broken. App was great until this update.",
      "The 3/18 update broke the app. It switched my number to my wife's number in the profile, and I am not receiving texts or able to send them. I cannot find a way to fix it within the app. This is ridiculous. Did you people not bother to test this before screwing up the app? It was fine as is, if it isn't broke don't \"fix\" it. Now it's useless. Stupid. I'm working remote thanks to Coronavirus, and now I'm without the texting my team uses to communicate. FIX THIS ASAP.",
      "The update is more of a downgrade. The interface now is smaller making text threads look cluttered. Also can't have black font on most of the colored chat bubbles and white writing is really hard on a lot of peoples eyes, not just mine. Going to try reverting back to old version. It reset all of my customizations even avatar.",
      "Before the updates I really liked this app. I recommended it to all of my friends and family. I don' like it as much anymore. The cursor is nonexistent unless you tap on the screen. You can't just start deleting unless you tap on the screen. I liked the old app, I didn't even mind the old app crapping out on picture mode - which used to be really cute before it sucked. But the changes you keep making don't improve this app. Change it back to having cute pictures without crashing. Have a cursor.",
      "It's extremely ugly now and has a similarly ugly loading screen of sorts all of a sudden when it didn't before. And before they go \"Oh you can change how it looks\", it isn't the backgrounds and bubbles and text styles that are ugly it's the layout and the little bar area you type in that look like the back end of a donkey with the flu standing in the rain. Otherwise it's fine. Four out of five because it technically works well, I just think it looks awful."

This release contains the following features, as well as stability and performance improvements: <br><br>• Quieter notifications: You can see fewer notification requests with a new permission option. <br>• SameSite cookies: By default, cookies are treated as same-site only. <br>• Secure media: Insecure audio and video on secure pages are automatically upgraded to secure connections.",

      "The older versions were simple and easy to use. But, there are things I don't like in this new update. 1. Some gesture controls have been changed. 2. The TABS IN GROUP style seems to be very complex and it is hard to getting used to. 3. Switching between two tabs is not easy like before. So I would be happy if the older layouts are used in the future updates.",
      "I've used this app extensively for years, and I've loved it. Recently, though, they've made a change get in the way you search for images. Once you search by image, and tap, \"View more sizes,\" the following view no longer displays the dimensions for the images. It was a nice touch and one that I really enjoyed, when looking for wallpapers, but now that it's gone, I don't think I'm going to be using this app, anymore.",
      "You need to fix your App. Been getting a lot of error messages for the past month. Apps are often unresponsive and won't open. Not having any of these issues on other Google sponsored browsers like Opera, and none on Bing. Prefer Chrome, but until you get these issues solved I'm switching over to something else. Note I have cleared the cache and data at least 3 or 4 times.",
      "This app is an absolute slap in the face to the user. At a time when MOST people use their mobile phones for everything, this app snatches away all the functionality of the desktop version. There's no easy way to duplicate a tab or close \"all\" or \"other\" tabs just by pressing on the tabs themselves. There is no way to save favorites on the homepage. No quick way to get to bookmarks. And worst of all, no option to have all sites open in desktop by default. Horrible user experience. Disaster!",
      "My chrome has also not been working since the last update, won't open or load any page. Have already uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared data, and followed all the troubleshooting instructions in the support pages. These are not a solution! Please help. I have already checked I'm connected to the internet and have already checked out your community answers, they do not solve the problem. Please don't reply with an unhelpful automated response!"

      "THE MOST UN-PROFESSIONAL APP I HAVE SEEN IN QUITE A LONG TIME!!! I hope this app gets banned for the lack of Truth in the descriptions. I get calls from telemarketers on block calls all the time. Ido not understand why the software writers didn't do a better job or respond to complaints given by people in this review section. They must not be paying attention to what people write otherwise these problems would be fixed. So do you ever wrote this go back to school and also take and etiquette cl",
      "This app is the worst! When you are on a call and a number you have blocked calls, it hangs up the call your on. This app has cost me money. There's calls I have to pay for. When a call comes in and I'm on a paid call, hangs up the paid call. I've sent emails upon emails and I have received no response.",

      "Glad to see that emojis have been updated. However, the \"Last seen\" status is a feature that is still completely messed up: it always shows that someone is online or was active a few minutes ago, even though he has been inactive for a while (even if he hasn't touched his phone for hours). And while I write a message to someone, Viber does not update his status and shows that he is online even if he is not any more. Still needs improvements.",
      "Have used Viber for years now, however in the last 24 hours it's become unusable. It freezes my entire Pixel 4 while replying to a message, or it will freeze while typing a reply. It also force shuts itself with a \"Viber is not responding\" pop up. Really frustrating as the majority of my family and friends use this app and not being able to reply to any of my messages is very annoying.",
      "Ok they reverted back. Thank you. Old review : last version took away \"attach my location\" to a message option. Was the only reason I used this app. Other similar apps are better at other things. Viber removed a feature and does not even mention it in the update. Viber is taking any options/features that made it better then others out. Businesses work on features that differentiate their product, Viber works on make their product same or worse then others by taking features away. genius!",
      "BRING BACK DOODLE FEATURE, PLEASE! No matter I set picture quality on excellent, it's still poor quality when I receive it. Just add original quality, not low, medium, excellent or whatever. For video it's even worse. When I receive video, the same has much worse quality than original file that was sent to me. ADD ORIGINAL QUALITY for sending / receiving photos and videos, WHERE DO YOU LIVE? And ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MESSAGES, really? Annoying and not good at all. 😠 Bring back Doodle!!!",
      "I have used Viber for text and voice calls for many years now. I have been mostly satisfied with the overall performance of the app, however, the app has been very leggy lately. Messages sent and recieved mostly do not appear at all or appear a few hours later or some times even next day. Photos sent keep uploading and then 'failed to send' notification appears and photos recieved do not download. I have checked if I have 4g or wifi issues, but I don't. I t is the app issue. Please fix."

Even tho they do work as intended, they are so outdated as far as their capability to get us real time information. I'd give 0 stars if possible. Waist of time.",
      "Streamlined and easy to use. It's now the 2nd day... I'm doing a rebutal on my first review. Live Mobil Location is an absolute disappointment. I have yet to get one piece of useable infomation from the app. Nothing that is remotely close to a gps location has resulted from hours of my time in an attempt to access such information.",
      "Garbage. Besides the irritating ads that pop up while trying to find a location and knocking you back to earlier point and most frustrating once you find area and click to get address location the message from hell appears \"ERROR\" no matter where you click. Only installed a half hour ago and now I will fix the \"ERROR\" message to read \"DELETED\". Problem solved. Besides Google Maps is more superior and no ads.",

      "I will never use it ,, i face 5 ads without even see any feature...when i was going to close it again ads ads ads... so why should i keep it in my phone...why should i watch too much ads to check my location? its like paying 100 bucks for the item which worth 5 bucks."

      "Got a new phone I downloaded the apps. The money transfer app worked but not the calls one. I couldn't login they said invalid number. I called customers service they asked me to go on the web .My account was ok on the web , they asked me to uninstall the app and downloaded it again then restart my phone which I did. I have been with Boss revolution for a long time I can't even remember but this app is a pain in my neck every time I have a new phone. Therefore I give it one star",
      "I got a new phone and haven't been able to use my app i have Uninstalled and reinstalled this app several times and still can't get it to work its been a week and I have tried calling customer service and they haven't been able to resolve the issue as of yet",
      "I have a problem with this app . I can not recharge my fone online with my credit card. Please tell me solution",
      "Still a year later I tried to use again and get a busy signal as Soon as I try. No explanation. Multiple different numbers. And this app want to alter my numbers after the call don't go through. I wonder if the other part had the app would the call go through and still be charged even if it's VoIP both ways.",
      "Service quality not that great. It keeps dropping my calls after a while and I have to reconnect. Then it's start reading the time for about 15 secs before it begins to ring"

      "App is very inconvenient. Every now and then it freezes and I have to open it again. Then you can't multitask when you are talking as you have to go back to the call to disconnect it (or to put it on speaker). The dialing is not smart.. it cannot differentiate b/w a contact with +/00 as International Dialing code and one has to modify the number on dialpad before calling. App ease of access needs to improve a lot.",
      "Pretty much does what it promises but it's not possible to go offline without signing out. It's annoying because I only want to be online in work hours but I don't want to have to type my password at the start of every day. The persistent notification is pretty annoying too. I only need a notification when I get a message.",
      "Login is a bit confusing. I've had to reset the app after every call due to it freezing. Also, when I've completed a call there is no way to disconnect, I've had to rely on the party I've called to hang up for the call to disconnect, which again led to the app freezing. Some calls went automatically to speaker phone. These challenges are proving to be very frustrating as my employer has allowed some of the staff to work from home during these trying times, using a Samsung android phone.",
      "Currently there is no way to add contacts. If you want to call somebody, you basically have to go through your call history and find their number, but you can't associate a name with the number. That said the call quality is really good. The app doesn't work with my hands-free device though - or or my headset. What baffles me is that the screenshots of this application in the play store show this feature however it does not exist in the actual application.",
      "Good system, however it's slightly inconvenient that every so often my session resets and I need to log back in. I can appreciate the security aspect of that, but still. Also drains phone battery quite quickly compared to my regular android phone system. Otherwise handy as, easy to transfer calls on work system and gives me freedom to get rid of my desk phone."

      "The website is awful. I can check how many minutes I have, but it is impossible to order a plan. The site kept erasing my payment information. This would force me to call for assistance but the support staff are not helpful. I just stick to buying the prepay cards from the store.",
      "Tried to renew my account only to find that is impossible to do because the screen for renewal has no access to a keyboard. Tried the text help. Same story. Fill out this firm but no keyboard. Their phone their programing. Idiots. They did respond with a phone number to call. That was just as frustrating. Their automated system kept asking the same question over and. Over. When i finally got a human they could not get their system to work either. They kept asking me to repeat my information .",

      "So I am really disappointed with this app. I should have read the reviews first. I just tried it for the first time. The main reason I wanted this app was for the recording feature. I set it to automatically record my conversations and when I ended my call I went back to replay my recording to see how it sounded. Well there is absolutely no sound at all. An hour and 20 min conversation of dead silence. I can't even find any options to fix this. Will be uninstalling asap.",
      "Don't even waste your time with this one. You can't hear the person on the other end line. You might just as well talk to yourself. Blocked calls? Pfffff.....they still get thru. The blocking don't work at all. If someone calls the conversation isn't even recorded. The blocking method has nothing.to do with it. FIX IT SO IT WILL RECORD! THIS APP SUCKS BUG TIME!",
      "Great application as it has a great database of users but has one very serious and anoying bug. It freezes the phone once try to identify caller and it keeps popup screen frozen for 30 sec to 1 minute after receiving the call. Sometimes freezing does not allow to answer the call and it remains frozen for sometime. Too sad as this started after last upgrade.",
      "Has everything you need in a call app/call blocker/caller ID, call recorder.though it does let some useless unsolicited telemarketer's calls through sometimes. It Work's well once you figure out all the services it performs.But the circled 'yes' choice isn't showing on their questionaire so you can't answer in the affirmative saying YES if that is your choice of answer but you can answer \" NOT SURE\" if you want which is weird and you'll be tempted to cause can't use YES 😱",
      "I have had a bad experience with this App. Since I have installed it on my phone I am no longer able to answer calls. They do come through but it is not showing anywhere or even giving me an option to answer call, I can only see the caller once they have hanged up and that's on my recent calls."

      "If it's slow,it's because it's encrypted. If you can't connect,try using \"bridge\" in the settings. It works well with Orbot. Orbot, you can have your other apps go through it as well and use \"bridge\" also. If you open orbot on phone start up, unclick bridge first and connect again. Select bridge again after connection. I use older Orbit app and I have no problems. If you connect with bridge in orbot,don't turn on bridge in Tor Browser, it will delay connection.",
      "App is good. But sometimes it takes too long to connect. I never have this problem in my PC version browser. And few sites are not open on this browser which tracks location. So these sites terminated my login.",
      "This is really an awesome browser, the only thing that I don't like (maybe it's a good thing for security reasons), but I would like to record my screen and do a video on this browser but when I do I can't see the browser screen it's all black. Is this a security feature I'm assuming? I prefer ublock origin over noscript so now I can block all kinds of garbage.",
      "How is this app possibly this slow to finish connecting to the TOR network? My desktop TOR browser connects in seconds. This app takes close to a minute every time.",
      "Tried this and alpha versions. Both crash after a few minutes. Hardware: Asus Chrombook cp101 Flip A website does not need to be loaded for the freeze up crash to occur. No other applications are open. Opens up chrome browser on crash. Preceded by a Blacks screen. Maybe ONE tiny DOT on the screen lit that happens at different locations. Worked great before. Running current Build: Version 80.0.3987.89 (Official Build) beta (32-bit) Was the same it seems with Vanilla Mainstream build of ChromeOS for my build by google for my hardware. Love to donate more. Proud Supporter of the Tor and Mozilla Foundation. Look forward to using Crypto Features Thank you."

      "This is a good app, and it definitely has potential! However, I am disappointed with the following; (too many ads) that there is no remove ads with purchase option, when you lock an SMS convo with a passcode by tapping on the unlocked padlock icon - it prompts you to set a password. You have to enter this password everytime to see the conversation. My issue is that there is no \"permanent\" unlock the convo feature after it's been locked. I'll rate 5 stars when the developer fixes these issues.",
      "Its perfect for keeping in contact with my son while hes gone and thats so awesome 5 stars for me. I wish you could add the feature screen share while on facetime so that the both people can watch a movie together while on facetime. That would be so great if they could add that cus I had it for my LG G5 but my Samsung A70 doesnt have this feature and its newer phone so Im confused. Anyways my point is that its amazing and great in everyway. Its awesome for when they are away from Home",
      "Response to message doesnt work. Message sent but still says sending. Contact name doesn't show for some contacts but when pressing the number, the info shows that it actually is a saved contact. No delayed sending option. No pin to top option. Really no options other than customization. Uninstalling. Going back to the stock messaging app.",
      "A super clean, beautiful interface w/ optional themes available at your disposal. Nothing to cluttered or clunky either, as it's all very well optimized. No lag. No annoying plug-ins/extensions or integrated ads planted within the interface. Ultimately a great app with no nonsense from the dev's. Definitely a step up from the native stock app on my S9+. Gripes: Photos are organized by album rather than date. Ads Redundant emoji button. We already have one. Contacts don't update quickly.",
      "I love this app. It does everything that I need it to do. But I have to comment on these stupid huge emojis that keep popping up. They are pissing me off because they keep popping up when Im trying to text and I keep hitting them. Please get rid of them. Other thank that its great I can talk to my kids that are to young for an actual phone.😁 Its the only app I use for video chatting. And sometimes I completely forget that I cant call people on my phone and just use the app instead."

      "Good messaging app! I haven't had problems with the latest update so far. Messages load a bit slow if I'm not it for a long time but it's not such a major issue for me. I would also like to see some helpful administrative features for group chats (i.e. having designated users as admins who would be the only ones allowed to add/remove other users in their group chat, as well as choose theme and profile picture, and be able to delete any notes within the group chat). That would be great :)",
      "It's okay. I only use the chat feature but what i don't like about sending voice notes is that recordings always erase while I'm in the middle of recording and then i have to start all over again. Or if I'm listening to a recording and i need to so before it ends, then i have to start all over. You should have a option to press record and not have to hold it to talk and also, a day forward and rewind option.",
      "Notification volume: Incoming message: affected by \"Ring volume\" Incoming call: affected by \"Media volume\" *Why* are they different? Do not disturb mode typically has zero ring volume but *not* zero media volume - if you want to fall asleep listening to an audiobook or play white noise through headphones to block sound, you cannot set media volume to zero. So any incoming call on LINE will wake you up. (Incoming telephony call will not, because it uses ring volume, of course). (HTC U12 Plus)",
      "After the recent update, it automatically add ALL my LINE friend to my phone's contact list.... Why? Why wouldn't you ask me first? Just add a Pop-up window and say: \"Hey! Dear LINE users! We just add a new feature that can add your LINE friend to your phone contact list! Would you like to try it out?\". Instead of that, YOU MESSED UP MY CONTACTS LIST!!!! Even I turned the feature off, there are still all there. Now I have to delete them ONE-BY-ONE. I thought Japanese are very smart! 😡",
      "Developer should give a confirmation (like \"are you sure\" or \"yes and no\" when calling button pressed/touched. I've accidently called a random people in my contact, and that is awkward. Also this aplication doesn't provide \"back\" button. It's very unreliable for users who doesn't have (or dysfunctioned) back button"

Now not a single number can be used for the original intent, use, and functionality. Will be looking for a better service that allows for the full use of numbers as originally able to do. At the current usefulness of the app it's nothing more than an expensive quickly thrown out number that has zero usefulness unless you simply plan on ghosting people for dates or something else that's pretty lame.",

It works perfect to keep up with people that your required to speak to a person via court order, but do not need them getting your regular phone number. It is able to change, therefore allowing you to not have unwanted spam calls and prank calls very often!",

Cant get a hold of their support either. Use to be a 5 star app. Now just a theif. Update: was not resolved. Uninstalled.",

      "I have tried a lot of the different versions of this app but I like this one for me. It is also better than messages ane smoother running without all the glitches. I wish I could save some messages like the ones that are receipts and possibly send it to a file somewhere so I can keep track. Or when someone gets stalker messages. I'm not but it's a thing that happens. May be it could that be possible? I don't want to switch to another but I don't know if another has it either. Thank you.",
      "I like it, but get no notifications for text's, tried support, no response. A text app that doesn't tell you when you get a text is worthless. UNINSTALLED. Also takes forever to open a text çonversation and multimedia is a worthless button that just says sending for weeks. Zero stars is the real scare but enjoy money.",
      "I really really really want to like this app but im having so many issues out the gate. The theme store (or any of the stores) aeenr working for me. It wont let me delete messages. And ever since i started using it i keep getting warnings that too much memory is being used. Im so bummed bcuz i love to be able to customize to the extreme and this app potentially offers that, and tons of themes to choose from plus you can literally use any font you choose, but too many bugs):",
      "It says so that the messaging app is encrypted but whose to really know? Exactly the brains that built it they know so*I've used FB messenger since 2012.i don't think the changes recent are good ones because people can add to your friends list now, that the privacy slowly to where anybody can jump on.i liked the most of FB Messenger way back before they double crossed each other then tried to get even.I like my privacy on any App always thought fb would never crossed the line but I've been hit=",
      "Unfortunately I won't give this app more than 1 star as my message box sits on my home screen and every SMS I recieve is displayed I'd like to remove it off my home screen but have failed numerous times, I've even contacted support without any feedback yet... Highly disappointed as I've used this app for sometime without issues until now."

      "Very buggy. Developing pages and testing against this browser reveals all kinds of caching issues. Even after clearing the cache, the browser doesn't render things properly with missing images and text on some pages. It wouldn't even render a test page with a single img element and nothing else! Quitting the browser and restarting it makes it work properly at first, but as time progresses some elements start to disappear. Very frustrating to use and test pages against. If the devs want examples, I can provide them. Contact me.",
      "Nothing special about it. It's distracting with the surrounding irrelevant information. I don't like my time being wasted. I like efficiency. A clean page with to the point access of the tools I need. The ability to search for and find what I want at that moment, without getting bombarded with odd and ends that stop me from being productive.",
      "What was in that latest update (March 2020)? Google Play kept crashing during the install! It used to be a decent app, but someone has decided that all searches should be saved, which is annoying, the screen gets cluttered with previous searches that I don't want. Why do software writers keep removing sensible and useful features?",
      "Everyone should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, FASTER. It's actually pretty clean and efficient compared to some of the other browser choices that are available out there. You should at least give it a try, since it is designed to work best with the machine that it is installed on",
      "Everyone can visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, PRIVACY and VERY FAST. User Friendly, Reliable and Superb ! This browser has come on leaps and bounds over the last year or so. It was initially good, then they tried to fix what wasn't broken, now it's back to its old self again - only better. It's now even more reliable, nice to use and look at"

      "Dude I have a blast with this, it's a better experience than a phone call and I just like being stupid with my boyfriend around the house catching him off guard with my calls. Would've given it 5 stars but I've heard you could customize the sounds more in the old update and I'm sad I can't ):",
      "I like the old Zello. Bring back custom ringtones and the option to use the side buttons on your phone as ptt buttons to speak. It doesn't feel like a walkie talkie when you have to use the phone screen as ptt. Bring that old thang back.",
      "Very well made software it works great and a lot of fun butdue to the fact that you can't hear out of the speaker and everybody around you can hear what people are saying it can be embarrassing",
      "Love it, once you get use to how it works this thing is flawless, especially if your street racing and need to talk to your team quick and in real time",
      "Great app, use it everyday. I love it. Highly recommend useing it at work or play, or to communicate with people who may or may not be hosting CoVid19. [The Coronavirus]"

I do a lot of commute and connecting to my Bluetooth headphones was always an awesome experience. Not anymore I'm afraid. Everytime I make call the app would switch from Bluetooth to speaker as soon as my call was answered. Please fix this issue! I'm bound to use other apps with mediocre calling experience until this issue is fixed.",

      "I was under the impression that this app would have anorher number. Made calls not expecting my cell number would show! Thank you but no thank you! I really didn't want my cell number showing up for unwanted call!",
      "It work for a few days then just stop. It won't connect the calls so I'm uninstalling. All them ads to get coins is ridiculous. Going through all that and not to connect the call is a waste of energy effort and time. Fix the issues. Plus i updated thinking that was the problem and nope still didn't fix the connection issues."

      "I only use this for flash. I continue to use it because of the limited alternatives. It freezes constantly and the page resets constantly which makes it very frustrating to use and there is no way it can be used for any real work. It always froze but over the last couple updates, the page resetting has gotten much worse and makes it near unusable.",
      "Satisfactory, but painful to use. If there were more Flash Browsers for Android, I would likely uninstall Puffin and use them instead. The problems I have with Puffin are as follows: First, this browser is very slow compared to others such as Chrome. And second, it randomly refreshes the page way too often, making me lose a lot of progress even though I never exited the tab in the first place.",
      "Update March 4th: Downgraded my rating to 1 star. Came back to this app after almost a year. Uninstalling for good. App still crashing and choppy. Worse after most recent update. Used to be a great browser. Your last update made things worse. It's freezing and crashing constantly, the game I play is impossible because it's all choppy and I can't navigate smoothly. Please fix these issues...and soon. I'm seriously considering uninstalling.",
      "Works, but Flash support is slow and laggy. While playing a Flash game it's easy to accidentally hit the back button and lose everything instantly, there is no prompt. Edit: Changing to 2 stars after the app randomly refreshed a slew of times in the middle of work with no warning. I really wish there was an alternative, it's pretty clear the devs of this app put very little effort into Flash support and this browser as a whole.",
      "Everyone can visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS & FASTER. Puffin is the best ever web browser i ever come across..... However, for last couple of months i am experiancing an odd issue with full screen mode... In landscape mode video plays in bottom left corner of screen in third graphic quarter only. Video wont flash out in entire display.... With realy down heart i am planning to swithch for EPIC web browser... Please do needful to resolve this problem"

      "Personally, I've loved brave and have been a staunch supporter for quite some time now, however, this is the third time I've uninstalled and redownloaded in an attempt to fix random bugs. Previously, it refused to load most webpages. Now, it refused to download PDFs. Further, if the devs see this and can please bring back the old view for the tabs list, it would be much appreciated. I really do want to continue supporting BAT and changing the ad experience, but I can't do that if I can't use it",
      "First of all thanks to the brave team for creating such a nice app. Have been using the app for quite some time now and it hasn't disappointed me much. I would like to suggest a few addables; 1. Please enable night mode 2. Add backward/forward arrow buttons next to each other (without having to tap three dots). 3. Add grid view while selecting tabs. Please add them if it's within your business compliance. Thanks.",
      "The 'find on page' option is annoying. When you search for something, it scrolls to it, it doesn't directly go to it. This can get extremely time consuming if your webpage is really long and you're searching for a lot of things. Please try to give an option to turn off the scroll. EDIT: I have been using this browser for a while but I'm highly concerned and disappointed at the number of ads. I downloaded this browser for the promise of no ads. I'm gonna try to look for a new browser.",
      "I love this browser but there's a problem, I'm not sure if it's a device specific problem or not. It does however only occur on my Android device, the PC version is flawless. The trouble is; whenever I open Brave on my Android for the first time in a while, the browser starts hanging up. It continues to lock up and hang in 2 to 5 second intervals for several minutes at random. Eventually the hanging will come mostly to a stop and everything will start working as expected. Any fix for this?",
      "The latest update broke some functionalities. Some videos on mobile Facebook site will start playing then stop by itself. You can't even seek to play them again. Restart doesn't help. Doesn't happen with other browser. The tap and hold gesture on Facebook mobile site doesn't work sometimes and you need to restart the browser for it to work. Background video playback will stop working and you've got to disable and enable it again to work. I believe bugs were inevitable with these rushed updates."

      "This is very well app. This gives me a second mobile number from which i can do my office work or can prank with friends . This also provide us 20 minute free calling to place a call. its cost for more than 20 minute is more cheaper than other there are no advertisement for which we can irritate . There are no many formalities to do . Thank to the app developer for this app Thank you",
      "They give you temporary phone numbers, with varying expiration dates on your free account, so expect the number to expire, as they want you to buy a premium account. Customer service is also very hostile, with a holier than thou attitude. If you use this free app, expect to have to get new phone numbers constantly, no matter how often you use it. I strongly recommend you pay for the premium service. I am very happy with it, and the phone number does not change on renewal, as most other voips do",
      "Works wonderfully awesomely amazingly good!. Best phone app out of the 15 or so I tried. You get the odd full screen ad, WHICH IS ANNOYING AS HELL (devs?) but there are no ad timers, so you just close the ad with the x in the corner. I've Never had a dropped call and voice clarity is always excellently superbulous! No echos, no delays! I give two thumbs up and straight A's.. Plus the name of the app is low key and not some dumb name like oomoo which I wud b embarassed to say outloud to someone",
      "Actually a very handy app. Could do without the advertisements. It is easy to install and is ready for use immediately after choosing your number to use. No hassle no difficult settings easy to use. I recommend anyone needing a second line for whatever reason including privacy this is the app.",
      "This app was fine until I forgot my password. I've jumped through hoop after hoop with this company. Password resetting simply doesn't work for any email address. Emails are never sent. I've lost all my texts and now any account associated with my phone numbers with 2nd line. Don't waste your time."

I loved it so much I bought credits...but soon after I did my phone broke. When I downloaded this app onto my new phone all my credits I bought were gone and I had barely used any of the credits I purchased. I still have the same Google account, ph number , even service provider. Feeling rather ripped off",
      "It's a good app. You only get three calls per day. But about 4 day after installing my 3 calls are still on zero. I dont want to buy more. I dont understand I love this app just cant use it anymore. I think think this is stupid.😠",
      "Used to work great but since last update I can't control who the call comes from. I have emailed back and forth with the developer with no change to the app. I have paid for pranks a few tones but i won't again and i suggest you don't either. Developer: I have contacted you multiple times and you guys just keep telling me to uninstall and install the app back. That doesn't work!!!",
      "I bought credits a while back but had to uninstall and reinstall the app only to discover the credits I bought were gone. I talked to customer service to retrieve the credits I paid for and was never given them. You also have to choose a number from a list instead of being able to put your own in now. This obviously greatly decreases the chance of anyone answering. Avoid this app.",
      "I have emailed the developer with my issues. At first it was fun. I was able to call and prank people with other people phone numbers now I'm not allowed. Secondly I paid to have credits when the app was fun. I upgraded my phone and poof all my credits are gone. PLEASE GIVE ME A REFUND OR CORRECT THE ISSUE. THANKS"

      "There should be an option to mute conversations for a particular amount of time(1 hour, few hours, weeks) instead of just muting it indefinitely. Plus, it would help a lot if there was a received/read option for texts, along with the time it was sent at. The time is not displayed for all the texts, which causes problems during work. A dark theme would also be appreciated. The animations are a little crunchy, could be worked on.",
      "Very invasive app. You will need to basically give all information to them, and, on top of that, get an existing user to endorse you to pass their \"security verification\". None of these were clear at the beginning of the registration. Then I received a notification saying that my registration is \"suspicious\". They asked me to try again later. I gave up.",
      "Fantastic app, been using for many years, after switching to it from QQ. But, since two or three months ago, it keeps switching off automatically. Everytime I use it and I exit to use other things, the closes down. So everytime i enter it, it restarts from scratch. And also, it stops giving notifications: no sounds, no message display, no red icon. I can only see if I got a message if I open the app. I have updated it last month, but the problem was not solved . What do you suggest?",
      "Requires lots of memory, requires lots of permissions to your phone (the impression is - you give them all your identity). A few times I stuck in the jungle of Asian letters... When I tried to log-in for a second time, I forgot my password and tried to log-in with SMS code. Although everything was correct from my side, I've got the message that my account was blocked! Without no reason! And - if I want to unblock it, I need a friend with an account that's older than 6 months and bla-bla... I will never use this app again or recommend it to anyone."

      "This app has been great so far and I have been using it for 6 months so far and it's been great for being able to talk to my husband while he's in jail. We're never cut off, we're always givin a recorded 1 minute warning before the phone call ends. The only thing I can honestly think of that I don't like about this app is that it's extremely, extremely expensive!!!! Unless you have a out of state phone number to use. Well hopefully y'all enjoy the app as much as I have!",
      "It is a great app and pretty easy to use and I would have given 5 stars if not for the prices. It's over priced if I pay for 1 or 5 of its services at once It should only charge 1 service charge. It's very over priced if not for that It is a great app and I am sure you would have a lot more people use it 3 to several times a week for video visits if prices were better. Everyone Iam sure wants to see and talk with their loved ones without leaving home .",
      "I have had a terrible time with this. I spoke to customer service about not being able to receive calls and they were no help at all. Their answer was something about incompatibility but they were not specific at all. I have used this phone to receive calls from another facility and had no problems. I am at the point now where I will have to cancel and receive a refund.",
      "The app itself works like a charm although the one time I scheduled and paid for a Off-site Video Visit, the stream would either never connect or connected and then froze while my loved could neither hear not see me!!! Never got to even speak to my loved one much less see one another!!!",
      "Getting server error indicating unable to access Securus at this time, right at the time of my visit 🤔 3/21/2020 well I've gotten the issue resolved far as the app, but the facility RJC in King County WA. which my loved one is in isn't being fair or cooperative. I've scheduled the visit and I sat there the whole 25 minutes waiting for the person I was visiting to join the visit, the facility simply didn't allow the visit nor let them out to conduct the visit. 🤨"

    "comments":[
      "Doesn't deliver as advertised. First week of use, in trial period. All the robocalls tonight rang through and disturbed my peace. Only when I physically rejected a call did it go to the recorded answer. The caller was a collector I believe and he immediately got that it was a recording and disconnected the call so it did not fool anyone. When I tried to reach RoboKiller customer support thru the app, none of the links worked to do so. Very frustrating. [UPDATE] Has worked as advertised lately.",
      "Found that it did not recognize the calls that are actually bugging me (spoofed calls in mandarin). Was only able to block spoofed calls that was similar to my number where most are in the realm of 1-800... Etc. Cancelled after free trial. Only successfully blocked a call from my bank that I'm fairly sure was legitimate (to be confirmed). I liked that it transcribed voicemail messages, but like I said, most of them are in mandarin so... My visual assessment of the number was way more reliable.",
      "Works mostly as advertised. Surprised at the negative reviews here, haven't had trouble. Still, it doesn't waste as much scammer time as the marketing wants you to believe. I only get \"ring once\" or pre-recorded robocall scams that are \"press 1 to connect\" or make you call back a number. These aren't affected by the advertised \"hilarious\" Robokiller bots. Only the legit Dr's offices, uber drivers etc using non-whitelist numbers get the bots. I assume the real benefit is in the database.",
      "The app doesn't really work. I still get just as many spam calls as I did since I got it. What sucks is that the fix is to add a spam call to the list, but its just like me blocking the number only difference is now. They change the numbers like they always fo and the call still goes through. Im letting this month chatge after that Im uninstalling it",
      "Phone does ring twice then the app will pick up. There are a lot of answer bots to pick from. After the call is done you can listen to the phone cell. The app also stores your voice mails from your contacts."

      "Used this for the first time today because our phone lines were at capacity. It worked great and sounded the same as the phone lines. My only concern was there was no option to mute from my end. Can anyone tell me if it is automatically muted or what I need to do to make that happen? Thanks.",
      "I love this app it is super clear and can turn volume up super loud and it is as clear as if I was at the meeting. the one issue is when I hit the headphone it comes up with some kind of message. also can you answer on this or is this only for listeners? is there a chance of a button that you can click on and off for answering during the meeting if you wanted to set up a paragraph in the Watchtower to comment on with the conductor ?",
      "Using on AndroidTV box, Mi Box, connected to TV. Had to sideload/manual install because Google Play Store is different on AndroidTV devices and apk is not available. But it works GREAT. FYI works GREAT on pure Android Boxes which uses Play Store, we have both and see no difference. Never had a problem.",
      "Great app to tie into mtgs. Only problem I've encountered is when it says, \"this app has reached it's maximum amount of callers. You cannot connect to the mtg.\" I've looked into the detailed information on the app and have not found information regarding any limits of any kind. Can this be fixed? In other words ... Can it's connectors increase?!",
      "Great service One concern though...when the music is played it sounds as if its through a fuzz amplifier similar to one used for guitars. I have to turn volume to mute because sound quality is so bad & use another device loaded with the songs for singing along. Any way to correct this? Suggestions appreciated Kim"

It's reasonably quick, has it's own VPN and it blocks lots of annoying ads from corporations that track your browsing activity and sell your user information. Seems to work well with my Chromebook, and my windows PC. It works well on my Android phone but can be a little \"fiddley\" and sometimes annoying when it doesn't do what you want it to.",

      "I love this app, it's by far the best there is...and it's still in its infancy stage. This app allows you to dictate and transcribe even under windy conditions. It is extremely accurate when writing out your spoken words, and best of all it allows you to copy and paste your conversation or writings into Google Docs. The developers are spot on, they listen and do what takes to make this the absolute best transcribing app available. I rank it as 4.5 stars. How do I edit my text?",
      "I love this app! I've tried other apps like this one before, but this one is top-of-the-line. I only gave it four stars but that's only because it requires an internet connection. This app was created by Google with that help and input of gallaudet University. It works so well that I'm going to use it all the time! It even transcribes many different languages to such a Spanish. I only have residual hearing a very little of that, and this app is perfect. Way2go Google!",
      "First app of this type which works for me... However, I still have to find out the quickest and fastest way to transfer the text to anozer place. So far, when I'm done with the dictation, I touch the screen with two finger, select all and copy. Then, I have to open either a texting app or Google Doc, paste the text and either text via the texting app or to download the Google Doc. It's faster than typing the whole thing, but it should be simpler. Keep in mind: I need it mostly on chat lines",
      "This app used to work great but now it picks up so much background noise that in a still room , it thinks it hears water running when it's just still air. So frustrating. I used to use this app all the time. I'm dumping it. A bit of advice developer: if it ain't broke, DONT FIX IT!! Stop changing things that dont need to be changed!!!",
      "Painful slow to load after latest update. Used to be instant now few seconds to load. Huge inconvenience when you need it quickly. Often it complained that there is no wifi so it won't work but my LTE is working and fast. Why not use LTE? Want to know if I can use other Google products - bluetooth microphone or nest, etc to follow group conversation?? For example I want to place a microphone on the table in backyard and follow what 3 of my friends are saying on the table."

      "App working well, just one problem I'm having whilst using youtube. I like to play music in the background while at work, after 20 mins the music pauses and I get a popup asking if i would like to continue watching. It's quite irritating as I don't want to be constantly having to go to my phone every 20 mins. Is there any way to remove this function?",
      "Opening a new tab would show the 'activate advance mode now' and 'manage cards' while not showing my most frequent visited pages. That unbelievably frustrating. I get that you want to advertise for our but not showing it? Really? But you don't show that in incognito mode so I don't get the reason. Atleast it's good at blocking ads from video streaming sites.",
      "I have been using this application for a long time. Initially it was good at blocking advertisements when watching videos on Youtube. Then, advertisements appear continuously and disturbing. I report directly from the application and write reviews. Then, the developer of this application hears user's complaints and makes improvements. My suggestion should be to check periodically so that it doesn't stop users from using this application.",
      "I do not know whether this is a hidden function or not, but whenever I have an incognito tab open, and I quit the app halfway, and then reenter the app, the app will crash, and the tab I had opened earlier will be gone. It doesn't happen for normal tabs but only for incognito mode. Please fix this asap, it has been going on for months now.",
      "I got tired of the massive amount of ads both on the main yahoo news page as well as within the articles themselves. So I downloaded and installed this, and, guess what? Yep! This isn't blocking any ads at all. Uninstalling it within minutes of this review. It's a complete waste of time and memory."

Not sure it is safe to uninstall, but I'm going to try at the risk of loosing everything. If I do, Im off to get an Apple!! I was excited with my new phone which I've had for about 6 months now. Everything was wonderful and then came the update. It has run havoc with my phone!!! What a waste!!! Candace",

It's not spying on you, and it's not breaking your phone. Look it up if you really have to, or get a custom ROM and remove Google apps all together if you really despise them.",
      "This app is useless!!! It does nothing but mess up the function of my phone!!! Just another way to control what we do and how we do our phones!!!! Not to mention misleading!!!! It has nothing to do with our carriers!!! But it all has to do with Google!!! I've complained to Google about this situation and there is no acception reason explained especially after explaining the control over us how, when and where we use our phone!!! The key words!!! It's designed to study us how, when and where",

This rate prompt is so annoying, pops everytime i close the app. 🙄 UPDATE: As much as i like this app BUT aside from its annoying ad what i am most concerned is that it won't send a msg with more than 160 char. If i send a long msg after i press send it automatically vanished, wont show on the convo as unsent. And is not received by the recipient. Pls fix so i can rate it with more stars.",

However, when I get to those settings, there are no colors or options to where I can change them. Please fix this??",
      "I love this new app, but for some reason it uninstalls itself. Further FB doesn't seem to be entirely connect to FB app. Almost like it's this app is independent from FB. I recently got a message notification on my devise notification bar and I try to open to read messenger, it doesn't open this messenger 2020 app instead instruction asks me to download the lite versions of messenger. What up with that. 2 things: 1st-this app needs to be entirely connected to FB & 2nd- self uninstall guard.",
      "Everything works very well unfortunately there are lots of ads that's kind of a bummer. Saying how it's a free app it's just something to deal with unless you want to pay. However sometimes I have problems when I'm typing a message or riding something deleting or erasing that is giving me issues in the past just back out of the app and try again overall I like it",
      "I have only been using this for about a week but overall I'm happy. I like all the themes, and it's smooth typing. They're r times that auto correct puts in words I don't type or swype and u have to hold down the delete button to delete the word which I 4 get to do so its frustrating but overall I'm happy.UPDATE:I DELETED IT I JUST WASNT HAPPY W/IT..ITS NOT BAD JUST NOT 4 ME."

One my my folders simply stopped working - I've tried moving the images to another folder, to multiple new folders, copying them into a new folder, and they never appear on the app. Other folders work normally. Any idea what could be happening???",
      "I cannot select any image to make stickers. Only 1 photo (which is a .png file) can be selected so I thought that it might only take .png files but after converting my photos to .png, it is still not working. No wonder so many bad ratings! It shows some useless forgotten folders instead. Most people will uninstall already! Now you need to press the green plus button at the bottom and navigate all through your phone until you find the picture folder. Wake up devs!",

      "Works fine but wish that I could choose the thumbnail of the sticker pack. I would rather have the folder suggestions turned off and have the ability to add folders in the maker page (with all the files in sequential order). Rearranging the sticker packs in the app itself would be a nice QOL improvement too.",

      "Inability to cut off camera and mic before joining a meeting drew some very unwanted attention rejoining in a noisy environment. Ability to stay connected when shifting from WiFi to LTE is very poor leading to the above issue.",
      "Initially, ran into trouble as the purple bar with a # on it was not pressable, and the green checkmark on the keypad did not submit the room code. A call to support (and a bad review here) brought quick response, which is appreciated. After three months of multi-point use: this is a solid high-quality software. Good audio quality, and is given priority. Quick focus switching when someone starts speaking. Facilities for all the usual videoconferencing features. Kudos to developers."

I did not save on my insurance, but I saved a lot of time adding Epix using the app. ;-) Thanks for 20 years of ever- increasing excellence!",
      "Overall rating for Dish Network ... Don't waste your money. I have the Dish Wally receiver that requires \"update/downloads\" every 24 hours then doesn't lock back on to all satellites. Contacting Dish will only get you the same questions from different people who will transfer you to a different department where you will be ask the same questions, by different people that can not help you, apologize, thank you for chosing Dish, and bid you a good day. Save your money Dish does not care!!",
      "I can't even create a login. Every time I enter my email or phone number, it tells me that an email has been sent or a text has been sent. I never get anything. I hit the resend button until i get locked out of my account. Now i can't even log in to create a login to use the app",
      "No good unless u are able to study instructions on what to do, how to do it, then have rhe time or ability accomplish those instrucions. As I didnt't, I have not even the option to watch live TV as my receiver is in transit. Seems little regard for my enjoyment. I now have my Hopper3 with me in travel trailer I have both My Dish & Dish Anywhere downloaded on my phone. I see my equipment listed on the website. I have been enjoying watching my recordings. Need live TV yet"

      "Most frustrating. Just bought a Fossil Sport. I see a lot of postings. 1. Google Assistant does not work. Usually receive an error message that something went wrong. 2. Can't set reminders. After you try to add one, the dots just keep spinning. Is someone working on a fix or a work around?",
      "Horrible. After updating the app, notifications stopped working. App said \"There was a problem syncing (...)\". So I reinstalled Wear OS, did a factory reset on my watch (Fossil Explorist), paired again and got the same result. Reinstalled and factory reset again, now they won't even pair anymore. Yes, I also looked for help in your forums. No, it did not help. Please fix the app.",
      "I think it's good but it can be allot better. You need Google play music to stream all music directly from watch to a tethered Bluetooth headset and other music streaming services too. Features i should not need to have to download a 3rd party app: 1. Camera remote 2. Calculator 3. Sleep tracking 4. Google maps GPS. The UI should be in Black mode to save battery and more big finger friendly rounded menus. Apps should be standaline with no need to install the phone app instead it should sync.",
      "I started a running workout via strava & google fit & it lasted for 60 minutes. For straight 60 minutes my watch, fossil gen 5 did not connect to gps at all, not even for once. I have even sent feedback via tha wear os app regarding this & have even submitted this problem on the wear os community, the problem still persists & is downright irritating. Hope this time you take heed & fix this issue.",
      "Have an \"old\" (by technology standards anyway) LG G Watch R and to be honest it does very little. I get notifications from my phone, it tells the time (obvs), I can use it as a calculator, however google assistant hasn't worked in a very long time, just says it cant connect. Tried all suggestions I found online, reset watch and phone, even have a new phone now. Also none of the updates say what they have updated. Typical of Google to hide what they are doing really. I trust them less and less."

      "I have been trying to replace the part of the phone that shows when I make and receive SIM calls. This is one of the few apps that actually plays the role of dialer on my phone, but the contacts part is severely lacking. I can only see recent calls if they were made with hangout, and I can't access contacts or favorite contacts. Nice try",
      "Forced to use this app because Google fi is horrible and I can't make phone calls. So, using this for work and it keeps saying I need to pay, even tho I am paying to use Google Fi 'service' and then disconnect by business calls. I used to think highly of Google, not anymore. Stay away from Google Fi, it's really bad and their 'tech support' is worthless.",
      "After the last system update, Hangouts got a little messed up. The phoning part of Hangouts doesn't know any of the names of people in my Contacts. That is, if I try to initiate a phone call with somebody who's in my contacts list, and do a search for their name, it's never found. Also, in my phoning history there are no longer any names of people, instead that history just shows a long list of phone numbers that I called. The texting half of Hangouts, however, is fine, works just as before.",

This makes the app very difficult to use because I not only can't find someones contact to find their number and initiate a call but when receiving a call I have no caller ID to tell me which contact the incoming number belongs to. I manually granted contact permissions and it still did not fix the issue. Please resolve this as soon as possible. This is the only complaint I have."

      "A lot of the time, the network icon shows that it is active, but when trying to open or refresh an app, i get a notice saying something like \"no network connection\". But it is useful in that it connects from one unit to another in the same household wifi system without having to change networks manually.",
      "DON'T USE FILTERS. There is an integrated feature called family wifi (lot of set up for nothing but a safe search switch) but once you re-open your filter in the app, the router starts locking the wifi device by device and the only way to undo this is by resetting the router entirely with the physical button on the back. This causes hours of set-up time if you have a smarthome. DON'T EVER TOUCH THE FILTER FEATURE!!!",
      "My network integrity and uptime is fantastic. My devices connect and switch between hubs flawlessly every time. But when I go to cast something to Chromecast, I can often not find it without restarting the network and/or the device I'm looking for on the Home app. Sometimes I must unplug the device in question - be it a Home hub or a Chromecast - before it will even show as connected on the network even when I can give it orders via Assistant. Stop choosing my streaming service when I specify.",
      "I have a four access point (2 router, 2 extender) Nest Wi-Fi mesh, and this app absolutely rules for tracking usage, bandwidth distribution, reset and custom ability options, and more. Although it can be improved and I'm sure it will in time... 5 out of 5 stars.",
      "I have mixed feelings about Google Wifi. On one hand it is easy to set up, reliable, and has all you need for a very basic wifi network. The app is easy to use especially if you need to remotely check or manage the network for someone else like a technologically challenged parent. On the other hand it is very expensive for basic wifi. It also lacks some standard features that you might never need but if you do at some point it is mind boggling that they're not available, such as mac blocking."

I love this app !",

I was charged and the only way to contact the app is through email that they dont ever respond to. You'll be lucky to get anywhere using this app but you can count they'll charge you even after you've canceled and obviously they don't like refunding your money even though they wrongfully take it",

Furthermore, I try to contact the help support through TalkU app and through sending them number of emails, but again no one responded to any",

I am very angry and if I could give them a negative star review I would! I would highly recommend not using this app, unless you want them to take your money without permission!",

NOW,,, I never get my credit's from your offers. Everytime I try to call my family overseas your app goes to people i don't even know. I tried complaining and getting you guy's to fix your problems. I'm done with you. I found a company that takes care of their customers. TextNow people. TalkU is sinking bad"

Bluetooth Pairing \r\nDetermine which pairing process or clock synchronization your device employs. The process for pairing devices can vary. Sometimes, for example, it involves tapping a code into your phone. Other times, you can just physically touch your phone to the device you want to pair it with. In some cases, you only have to hold down a button on the speaker to pair it with a phone. If you’re not sure how to pair a device, refer user guide.\r\n\r\n2. Discoverable mode\r\nTurn on discoverable mode on your swatch. Let’s say you want to pair your phone with your car’s infotainment system. First, go into your phone’s or iwatch app settings and tap on Bluetooth. Then depress the buttons on your infotainment system, usually on the steering wheel or center stack, to get it looking for the device. Once it finds your phone, the car may ask for a numeric code you need to confirm or input on your phone. After you do so, the devices should be paired.\r\n\r\nProblems with BT pairing\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the devices you are trying to pair are close each to other. Do not try to pair a phone with a keyboard or any not Android/Android Wear bluetooth based devices.\r\n\r\n2. Power the devices off and back on. A soft reset sometimes can resolve an issue.\r\n\r\n3. Let’s say that faithful bluetooth connector speaker usually connects to your partner's smartphone itouch instead of yours. If you're having trouble with clock synchronization of your phone with the speaker, or wristwatch cuz speaker or iwatch is trying to activate its usual connection. Some older devices just try to connect with the last thing they paired with. If a Bluetooth device was previously paired with something else, turn off that other gadget.\r\n\r\n4. Charge up both devices you're trying to pair. Some devices have smart power management that may turn off Bluetooth if the battery level is too low.",

Unable to visit bugs never got fixed customer support never contacts you back they dont answer phones or emails one-way text messaging only Need to be able to use emojis would make it fun! UPDATE: Received new app today 3/19/20 text messaging seems to be fixed , 2 way text finally working but lost ability to send photo with ease ugh! Still no visit capability....I'm giving them a chance I have no choice, literally...NO CHOICE!",
      "🙄 Well then! \"Describe your experience.\" 🤔 Hmmm... Where shall I begin?!? Not going to even attempt at documenting all the inconsistencies/issues in which have occured, being that would turn out to be a novel. Simplified; always connection problems (either: choppy robotic conversations, blacked out screens, trouble accepting incoming calls-cuts off before it even begins, in turn causes problems calling back on either parties end, etc.) & of course the fees being charged for service provided.",
      "the stupid thing actually loads 1 out of 20+ attempts. if you are able to get to the video chat with your loved one ...a lot of the time it will end your visit abruptly after 2 min! there are rare occurrences when the loop holes are aligned juuust right, and you get to video chat with no issues. good luck though cause you're prob going to throw your device. friggin monopoly these people are running",
      "It's not too expensive. However the video visits ain't working right and I wanted to visit my girl for her birthday. Fix the visits. And adding contacts take you in a never ending loop as do the visits. I finally was able to add contacts BUT Visits won't go. And that's my main want is the visit."

      "so far I have sent 3 texts and answered 1 call, and this app works very well! 1/31/19 Update - this app has not let me down at all! I fell ill last November and stayed ill through January. I did not use my phone or my number, so I lost the number. I recently got a new phone, so I searched the Google Store for this specific app and just downloaded. Hopefully we still have a 5 star app!",
      "I think it's a nice App but frequently hybernate (sleep off) and crashes on my infinix Hot 4, version 6.0 within just a few minutes of logging in every time . Though calls and sms really worked fine, but I couldn't hear my voice in 2 calls attempts when I tried a call to it with my real phone 📱 number. Please fix up soon so I won't Uninstall. Please!",
      "This dumb app. Type a text, it freezes and closes app. There's a 4 sec delay on phone calls which is irksome. Freezes, closes and generally screws up. Once again some how wound up with the $5.99 per week version. Now they will ignore my still active $2.99 membership and change my number AGAIN!!! It's damned ridiculous and a pain to change my number every time this app randomly changes my subscription.",
      "It's great 😊 & it definitely comes in handy. Sometimes the when u make calls it doesn't work that well. That's only because whatever wifi u hooked up to sucks. Other than that I love the app I always get all my messages. Few calls from people I don't know but that's gonna happen with or without the app. Thanks guys for this app. I love & my husband loves it also",
      "Awesome app, 100% you can count on tthis app to work everytime. I'm a beta tester for this app and since day one it has really impressed me. Don't know why it has taken me so long to voice my opinion, my life got in the way before, my apologies to the creators....fine work guys!"

      "I use this as a proxy to get around school wifi, works well enough but unintuitive to start for the first few tries. Lacks ability to see what country you're in (at least in non-premium mode(have no clue about premium mode)) other than that, works well, slows down a bit, but it's really not that bad and you can still watch1080p even without psicash.bit of buffering but :/ if you live with poor internet. You wont notice.",
      "Absolute garbage! I also used Psiphon on different PCs, it may \"hide\" your IP but at the cost of your internet speed taking the hit to the point its nearly dial-up. Even their pay-for-speed \"booster\" option does absolutely nothing. Contacting them is pointless, they do not respond. Tried other VPNs and there's no comparison - the worst VPN service - ever. Now that I know what to expect, there's no incentive to buy any service from this company.",
      "I'm not impressed with the new update becoz nothing has changed; it disconnects every time and there is not much choice to choose different servers. I request you to add Russian server and improve the stability of this app. Still this app is far better than others and you can trust on it. But please add Russian server.",
      "It keeps saying waiting when i play somthing with or without a speed boost and it wont connect also when that happends my speed boost still deplestes so for all the people who are about to download this app read this review also if you want a better vpn its called (x vpn) it never lets me down",
      "I am from J&K & we are very Happy that you are still trying to connect us to internet.But in the recent update version 260,there is one problem,that it takes 5-15 Mins. to connect & it disconnect's very frequently.So please look into this matter. Thank You ♥️🇮🇳"

      "The app is sadly a huge battery drain. Furthermore the UI is poorly made and not intuitive to use. Answering calls sometimes makes them go to Speaker mode. In the Android app it's not explained properly how to log out of a queue, difficult to find. Call quality is very poor due to low volume, echo and drops in calls. Could use more options like on Windows OS. I'm sorry for the poor review, if the app is updated and the issues are fixed I'm more than willing to change it of course.",
      "I'm using this on Galaxy Note 10 plus - all appears OK until I receive a call. Unable to answer using the Galaxy when the screen is locked.I can only cancel the call. If I pick up on the desk handset, the Galaxy then continues to ring. I have also had instances when 3CX on the Galaxy has started to ring for a call that had ended earlier. When making a call - it is hit and miss whether I will be heard after someone picks up - WiFi signal is strong so unclear what is happening here. Same when I answer a call (when lock screen is off), I can hear the caller they can't hear me. I have no issue with the web and desktop apps. Disappointed that I cannot achieve full mobility as a result",
      "Using 3cx on all devices. I find the call quality to be a bit horrible most days, regardless of changing microphone gain would be great to have some function during calls to quickly access the quality of the call. and the details of the reports lacks a bit of body. But it's easy to use anywhere.",
      "They removed the Exit ignore push option. I legitimately have to uninstall this app whenever I don't want to use it. The 3cx team seems to imply using the silent feature is the same as the exit feature. This is a blatant lie. Your phone still rings/vibrates and gets the calls going to it. This is an atrocious app if you ever want to use 3cx on a computer and mobile you effectively have to uninstall the ph app whenever you just want to use the computer.",
      "It's okay, but I'm not really a fan of the way it now works with Android 10. If I've received a call on my office desk phone, the 3CX phone app is up and running in the foreground even after the call is finished despite the fact I never used my mobile phone to answer the call."

    "description":"How annoying it is when your friends delete their messages before you can see them?\r\nThe curiosity takes over. You just found the solution: WAMR!\r\n\r\nWAMR is the utility you were looking for. With one tool you are able to recover text messages and also any media attachment (pictures, videos, voice notes, audio, animated gifs and stickers)!\r\nNow you can also download Statuses! All with one app!\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\nMessages are encrypted on your device so WAMR can't access them directly.\r\nThe only solution available is to read them from the notifications that you receive and create a message backup based on your notification history.\r\nWhen WAMR will detect that a message as been deleted, it will immediately show you a notification!\r\n\r\nMEDIA MESSAGES\r\nWAMR will also try to save any media attached to the message and if the sender deletes it, you will receive a notification.\r\nThe following media types can be recovered: pictures, videos, animated gifs, audio, voice notes, documents, stickers.\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS\r\nPlease be aware that it doesn't exist an official and supported way to recover deleted messages. This is a workaround and may encounter limitations caused by the selected messaging app or even the Android OS:\r\n1) Text messages are recovered by your notifications, therefore, if you have put a chat on silence, or if you are currently watching a message on the messaging app before it's deleted you will not receive a notification so WAMR can't save it! This also obviously means that is impossible to recover notifications/messages before you downloaded this app (so download it quickly!).\r\n\r\n2) If messages aren't being saved, it may be caused by Android killing WAMR. Please remove WAMR from all battery optimization services!\r\n\r\n3) WAMR can't save files if they aren't completely downloaded! So if you are offline or you have an unstable connection, or in general if the sender deletes the message containing a media before the messaging app downloads it, WAMR can't do anything to save it.\r\n\r\n4) If you aren't using a WiFi connection, some media may not be automatically downloaded by your messaging app because of your settings. You can change this behavior in Messaging app > Settings > Data and storage usage and increase your chances.\r\n\r\nOther limitations may be caused by your Android version, or your system language (in particular if it is right-to-left).

      "This app is good, but sometimes it doesn't work correctly for me... Whenever I see a deleted message on Whatsapp, I open WAMR to see the deleted message, but sometimes it just says \"This message was deleted\", and instead the other messages that wasn't deleted colored red... As far as I know this app uses notification system to recover deleted messages, so maybe the problem lies on that... Still, this app is good, and I hope you can fix it in the future 👍👍",
      "Probably the best app to detect deleted messages/media, however, it has some bugs such as repetition of messages (often) and merging of 2 separate chats (rare; occurred when received messages simultaneously from 2 separate chats). Wishlist: detect messages from muted chats. I understand it's difficult as the app works by monitoring notifications.",
      "Actually this is a very good app. I might have given 5on5 if it doesn't gets interrupted once in a while more specifically in need of service. We often wanna check whether its active or deactivated and need a restart for its usual functioning. Apart from this, its a very good app. It'll be even more helpful if the above said issue gets fixed.",
      "This app does the job smoothly. But in my case it the \"run in background\" got disabled automatically. It prompted me to enable again. Although the option in settings was enable but still it was not working... It must have been a bug or something... However i uninstalled and installed again. Now it has started working again.",
      "Not working Device: Redmi K 20 Running Miui10 latest Nothing seems to be showing up in the message or media notifications but status are showing. I've removed the app from all battery saving/optimization options. The app is locked in memory. I don't know what else I can do. Any help will be nice. (Will change rating when it works)"

The permissions to access sensitive information is present. It's funny when the developer has to say the app isn't spyware or bloatware because most of the time that is not true. Open source the code of the app so we, as the users, can see if your claims are true.",
      "STOP TRIPPING!! Its not a radio its FM frequency to connect Smart Watches and Fit Bit type devices so it can communicate with your phone. I bought a Fitbit at Christmas and all of a sudden I see this app on my phone. It didn't come pre-installed on my Samsung S8. It on newer versions now to help make the connection easier for Smart Watches. It helps wrist devices and the app on your phone communicate. It's NOT Spyware, Bloatware or adware.",
      "I understand what people are explaining about the app being preinstalled, and it is supposed to be helping the phone. However, I get paranoid easily especially since I opened a photo stating that people should be aware of a particular URL link because it deals with sex trafficking and THIS APP RANDOMLY STARTED DOWNLOADING... 🤦🏼‍♀️ if this is really the case then I apologize for my judgement without looking at ALL the reviews and I really do hope it's just a preinstalled app. Thank you.",
      "Let's face some facts. If this app's purpose had been to be helpful to users as opposed to privacy data gathering for others (I'm looking at you, Verizon, Samsung, and developer, et al), we'd be able to delete it if we wanted. Should it be any surprise that the developer assures us that it's entirely harmless? Sheesh!"

      "I LOVE the app. It the closet thing to iMessage app not just theme wise, but experience wise. I think it should be androids default messaging app... butttttt it's way too buggy, the ads are annoying (I know yall are working on a premium version), and it's very disappointing it uses old Android emojis (which are damn near as bad as windows emojis) instead of using Android 10 emojis. That should be stock and ios emojis would be a GREAT option....p.s. I NEVER leave reviews but I see potential.",
      "Not what was expecting, very good app. The only thing I dislike is the add in message, you can't get rid of it, and there is nothing to buy which will remove the add.",
      "I have only been using this app for less then 24hrs. it has what most apps lack, it could of replaced the messaging app I've been using for years! but in todays total lack of morals, values, and respect. the one thing that is more important then choosing an emoji is the ability to block, blacklist, the relentless onslaught of robo calls text, and the morons that expect you to believe that they live nearby! with that being said, sorry guys you got a good thing started code in a black list.",
      "very easy to use, very responsive. I like auto dark mode at night. I was hoping that this app would join all messages from the same contact into one thread, but unfortunately not. I guess I have to find my old Nokia for such advanced features :)",
      "As someone else said this should be the default Android texting app. For me it works great and I don't mind the ads so long as they don't disrupt my usage. Looking forward to the spam blocking feature though."

      "Its great for getting around firewalls but the issue is that it doesn't bootstrap the client after you turn it off and turn on later. I have to either leave it on all day which slows my searches when I don't need to use krbot or access Tor. Either that or I have to uninstall and reinstall everytime I want to use it. I like this because it makes rerouting past firewalls so easy but the app leaves some to be desired.",
      "This app is fantastic for bypassing firewalls but requires a lot of redownloading almost Everytime you turn it off. Aside from the self explanatory flaw you can easily bypass firewalls by turning on \"share proxy interface with WiFi peers\" and connecting the device to your phone with a hotspot. Overall a fantastic but can certainly use improvements.",
      "I swear to god the new version its just a bunch of failure, Before the update my internet speed 2mb ,but after the update its Change to 10kbps and its never stop crashing, If you want to use orbot just use the older version its much better, until they fix the newer version to much stable Edit:ok now its much more stable than before thank you developer for your effort!!",
      "Having a hard time connecting rn....Was able to use this after updating it last month, but now it can't even start its handshake to the ports...I keep on restarting it and as of this comment it's the third time! If only the other Tor app was not largrer than this I would have kept that already... 😑",
      "After update, the issue of Orbot randomly shutting itself off is still happening. Can't connect to several apps, which is the only \"notification\" that I get. And even though VPN is turned off, it's still running in the background. The key icon is showing on the notification bar and some websites can't connect."

      "Thank you for this nice email application, push mail notification and synchronisation is very fast, make me keep updated with my email, old email also still available to be downloaded, not limited by time or numbers. I was so frustrated before with my exchange email account. Other email applications was slow in synchronising and confusing to find if we categories email based on folders. Alhamdulillah, if you are moslem Insyaa Allah you will get reward in this life and after life, aameen.",
      "Overall the experience is ok... However there seem to be a delay period between other networks in sending or receiving emails. Also one is not able to forward multiple emails to another email account... That should be considered. Since we are a business it would be great to add a pic to our signature especially if you want to advertise.",
      "I love the minimal design except one thing isn't minimal. The avatars for the contacts is so large and if you get rid of the avatar then you have a large checkbox to look at. Make the avatar smaller and get rid of the check boxes. The check box should come up after long pressing one of the emails.",
      "One of the best messaging apps in the market. User interface is clean and easy to use. Pin protection is a handy feature. Ads are unobtrusively placed (as message boxes) and can be disabled from About>Advertising menu. Dark theme would have been a great feature.",
      "The app works very well; I especially like the almost instant push notifications when new emails come in. My only issue is with replies. Each reply gets another \"Re:\" added. If you reply 6 times, you get 6 \"Re:\"s showing in subject line. Is there a way to shut that off?"

The customer support is the most amazing part of the app. They really care about how their app is running, respond lightening fast to questions and give easy to understand instructions on how to fix issues, which in my case have been problems with my phone not updating correctly. Keep up the good work Textra!",
      "I was really enjoying this app but l started receiving messages all through the night last night, which is highly unusual for me. Upon contacting the senders to see why they were texting me all night, I found out that those messages were sent during the day and evening, but I never received them until after 2am! Why are my messages being delayed?? People probably thought I was ignoring their messages.",
      "Textra is, and probably always will be my favorite alternative SMS app; it's clean, customizavle and almost identicly to stock Messaging apps. The only reason I'm doing four stars across almost every app I use, is the fact that the only new feature with paying for premium is ad removal. I get you have to make your money, but it would be nice to pay even an extra dollar for some more features! Otherwise, this is an amazing app!",
      "This app is top notch. I have a Google pixel 3 and you really can't customize the messaging app the comes stock with the phone. So I figured I'd try this app and this app has many customization features. You can change the way the icon is colored, specific icons for specific contacts, custom word bubble shapes, different fonts, a huge GIF library and many more awesome features. If you want an extremely customizable SMS app, this is the one. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",
      "I love this app so much. The messages send right away, practically EVERYTHING you can customize, and it's just great all together. Hell, you can even change the color of the freaking app icon! This app is exactly what I was looking for. I have one issue though, whenever I send a video or gif or song or whatever, it takes a few minutes to send it, I don't know if my phone is just a little crappy or if it's a issue with the app itself, but still, Textra is great with that issue or not! :D"

This isnt worth a buck and should be free like others. Update, tried it again they claimed its improved, still stinks. Get robocall, much better. Dont waste money here",
      "New updates = nothing new. Please make option to send ALL non-contacts to voicemail. And maybe something that will integrate with Verizon messages to block / send non-contact texts to a different place like a \"unknown contacts\" group box. Then you can call it Verizon Communications Filter... All risk levels blocked = 25% of actual calls blocked, but it will tell me that it's spam. Gee, I didn't know that already when I haven't lived in my phone's area code for a decade...",
      "If you turn on the more restrictive settings, which is what I want, it can sometimes block numbers that are not spam. Should not be a big deal, you can white list the number. But no, Verizon wants to gouge you for $3 a month to be able to do that. There's one thing you count on with Verizon it's that it will always put profit above the customer.",
      "It's a piece of junk and won't even open on a OnePlus 6T (can't speak to any other device). When I launch the app on my completely up-to-date Android 10 phone, the spinner just spins forever on the app's Verizon branded splash screen. I've left it for an hour and no change. Uninstalled and reinstalled a newer version months later and same behavior. Wishing I hadn't granted it permission to all my contacts now! UNINSTALLED.",
      "Doesnt work with Android 10. Worked before that. Slow to update, so I cancelled that paid service. Not paying for something that doesn't work. I liked how it worked when it was actually working. Won't be resubscribing until it's fixed. Don't waste your time."

It sends a text, an email, and an app message for every message sent. I don't need it in triplicate every time a message is sent. But I if I edit the setting I don't get any of the messages at all. I still hate this app and we are 3/4 of the year over.",
      "I loved this app prior to Parent Square's latest update this past December 2018. Whatever \"bugs\" Parent Square believes they have fixed has created a negative user experience for this Android user. This app is unreliable as I have missed important school notifications, but more importantly, I've missed direct communications from my child's teacher. 2019-20 Update: Excellent app...any and all previous issues have been resolved.

      "So far this calling app has been so easy to use, and easy to set up. I was thrilled to see so many different numbers available, and also be given the time to personally choose the right phone number for myself. I am genuinely impressed, and pleasantly surprised by how many more choices I was given compared to the other apps I have used. I am loving 2ndline!",
      "I love the convenience of this calling app. It prevents me from giving out my personal number which sometimes ends up being used by Robo Callers. It’s such a nuisance to get a new personal cell number. The app helps me out by giving me a second phone number, super easy to call and text",
      "Throughout my life , no app I have ever used gave me so much options and so much features . 2ndline provides a clear second phone number that it almost seems as if the person is talking in front of you , Calling is also amazing. Definitely recommend this calling app for anyone .",
      "I love 2ndline that we have so many phone numbers on what to do on our accounts . Although, I wish that the premium was less money and there were less or no adds without it. All around. It’s Pretty good!",
      "I would like to say 2ndline is an excellent calling app. When we call it goes very well. When we’re texting it’s immediate. I can send text easily and receive them just as easily. It saves my chat which I like."
