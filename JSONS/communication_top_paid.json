      "The only problem is cheap interfaces! With a decent device, not the garbage sold on Fakebook, it does what it says. One really annoying problem is that it refuses to quit. Doesn't matter how many times you close it, Quit or even Force Stop, it's like a Premiership manager and bounces back, demanding to be connected. This can lead to problems with the cheapo devices as you can't pair and then open the app.",
      "App freezes, stops responding, then completely fails to load. Delete from device. Reinstall. Fails to load. Application is useless because there is no product support. Nobody will help you. You cannot contact the manufacturer. They take your money. When it does not work, you are at a loss. Do not throw your money away. Use FORScan or equivalent. Even in it's working configuration, this app does not allow you to access your car's computer to make any changes. You cannot remap your air-to-fuel ratio. You cannot change your transmission shift points, or adjust the transmission shift from firm to soft. You cannot change the profile settings for tire size. You can not enable or disable any settings. When it works, before the app crashes, freezes, and fails' it's just a glorified monitor. Information which is already accessible via your onboard display screen.",
      "I have been using it for 5 years now, along with plugins, with el-cheapo dongles and the recommended ones, across 2 Android phones. Although used with older than '12 cars, it has been completely reliable, dependable and trustworthy to have diags on the engines. Cheaper dongles do give the occasional connection hiccup, but that isn't the app's fault. I also like the ability to work with the plugins for simulator games to be used as a HUD! It might take a bit of time to configure, but that's it!",
      "I have a VW Passat B5.0 2.8 V6 30v 4 motion/synchro with a few problems, like a miss fire, but the error code count is 0 or zero. All I can get out of this app is what's already on my dashboard so it's totally useless for me as it doesn't do what I have paid it to do. Please show me some firkin error codes. There has to be some. Plus the help is just awful. Its a complex app so proper help would be appreciated. Oh and tested on two modules. Just junk.",
      "It's an amazing app; I've used it for years. A definite 5-stars for functionality. However, only 4-stars overall due to very poor UI design. While it's very powerful, learning to use it is a real chore, and even after my years of use, I still feel like I'm not getting everything out of it that it has to offer, due to it's convoluted interface. A future interface refresh would be very welcome."

My fingers are crossed Dev is still around to help out. Otherwise its been a great app.",

This is a good apps to share our unlimited internet quota to other users, but will suddenly disconnect every hour and we user need to manually reconnect it. Developer said if we paid for full version, we won't have this disconnecting issue. It is a big LIE.. I PAID, and now i still have the disconnecting issue. If they fix this disconnecting issue, I will change my review. If you still saw this review, means they have not fix it.",

      "I see a lot of negative reviews for this, however I have not had any issues for what it's worth. Connected to our server inside our network and outside the network. Stayed connected and worked great. Your mileage may very but for .99 it is worth trying if you think you could use it.",
      "Absolutely terrible... App UI freezes and it becomes fully unresponsive. Even if I close the app, it still runs in the background and I have to either restart my phone, or force stop services. An application that I paid for shouldn't work like this. 1 star till this is fixed. I have this bug for more then a year... It makes the app fully useless...",
      "This app allows you to securely communicate with friend with good server, data usage depends on bitrate being set to specific channel and audio quality is pretty decent but I want to see some of the PC version features like: being able to disable microphone so you don't have to disconnect in order to record something else like Instagram story, also I would like to see internal echo reduction for unprocessed audio so we can maybe listen to music while talking, and also rework settings for look 😊",
      "First bought on an iPhone 7 years ago. Have it now on my Android phones. Still randomly crashes after 10 seconds after entering a server, and my phone needs to be restarted to get the application to run again. Just like old times. Added a star because it at least lets people know I left the office.",
      "Wow the app is totally a mystery in how to use it. There is the voice that keeps informing you of activity but the volume is so low you can not hear unless the spraker is to your ear. No way to find a channel you might be interested in as far as I know. No help guides to look at so gurss better go online to try to find something. Hope it works good and I can figure it out. People seem to use it on there network rsdios."

      "Very glitchy and difficult to type within text boxes. The scroll jumps back and forth and eventually I just went back to chrome. Also I wish they would remove the annoying add on that goes on top of the system keyboard when we attempt to type. It blocks us from seeing what we are typing and makes any typing within puffin very annoying. Been complaining for months.",
      "I was using Puffin free version for a long time to play flash games and now that you can't play on the free version I decided to go ahead and pay for this one and guess what ? Still can't access the flash theater to play so will be deleting both versions! !",
      "Really like this app wish they would allow us more customization options over the virtual gamepad ,such as transparency options and additional buttons, if that was possible would be top notch.I mostly use puffin to play my favorite flash games on my phone and I hope they don't neglect any opportunities to improve upon it",
      "STILL can't use flash properly. What's the deal? Why does it keep snagging like that? I paid for this app and expect to be able to use it normally. The thing you tout as your best feature doesn't work properly.",
      "Massive Edit: After the last several updates since my previous review, the videos have been working and playing flawlessly. I'm not sure what they did, but it works fantastic now!"

      "Don't waste your time paying for this app. You have to turn it back on every 3 hours. If it was once ever 12-48 hours that would make more sense. At this rate, it will take someone almost two years to recover the cost of the app. Why didn't I just buy some Bitcoin with it instead and stop wasting my time? It's not worth the money, use the free version and just buy Bitcoin if you don't want to deal with having to turn mining back on every 3 hours.",
      "A good start. Having to click the blue button every 3 hours is a little bit annoying but I guess there are reasons to keep the user engaged with the app. my suggestion would be to offer a gold option or a Premium app version of this. charge a little bit more and then the user doesn't have to keep clicking it. For a one hundred percent autopilot version, I would pay a little more for that, for sure. Otherwise keep up the good work is a pretty cool app 😎",
      "CryptoTab Browser Pro is the absolute BEST. There is no comparison.. If you have active referrals and if you can mine with them, you will always earn a passive income. They always pay and they are trusted and professional. They have paid me several times and I will continue to use CryptoTab until I die or until there is no more bitcoin in this world to mine. Thank you CryptoTab for your awesome service and I wish you the most success as well as much success for my fellow bitcoin entrepreneurs.",
      "This is based on my own opinion. I think it is worth it (4.5$) because of these reasons: ( btw my phone is Samsung Galaxy J5, Android 6 Snapdragon 410, 2gb ram, 8 gb memory) 1.The original CryptoTab Browser's mining speed on my phone is 10 - 13 h/s while the paid version which is CryptoTab Browser Pro is 320 - 335 h/s. 2.The mining speed of my laptop that is using CryptoTab Browser for Windows which is an Asus Windows 10, i3 8th gen processor, 4gb ram and 1tb memory is 97 - 125 h/s. Thanks.",
      "I love the app. And the concept of it producers, 3 star for now, though I have not withdrawn from the app for the first time but from the testimony of others you guys are guine. The part I don't like, is the annoying part of Enabling the boost every 3 hours please work on this part, More Grace."

      "It works but it's not very user friendly. I can't even change the ringtone to differentiate between calls. It's stuck on call integration mode and u can't figure out how to change it. Every call looks like it's coming through my provider now. I'm revising my review. After reinstalling I was able to reset the call settings that were locked during the initial install.",
      "Thank you for nice app but it has no support for SIP messages. I work a lot with messages in my company so I need to use Zoiper that has this capability. I'll give 5 stars if suport for messages is added to this app.",
      "The version for IOS is great, for Android is way behind. Doesn't seem to support ipv6, it doesn't work through mobile data, can't connect. It does work via VPN.",
      "I used to love the app, but recently at times after using the app my phone still thinks I'm in middle of a call even after closing the app, therefore the phone won't ring and when I try to leave a VN in WhatsApp it tells me I can't record a VN during a call, even though there is no active call, it's just that Hroundwire didn't update the OS that the call has been hung up"

HOWEVER, every time I try to open the app a full-screen notice is forcing me to set the app as the default SMS app and there is no way to get past that screen to get to the actual app. Very frustrating.",
      "This app works, which is important. I'm giving four stars because 1) there is no documentation that says you absolutely must enable all notifications from the app. This puts an annoying banner on my locked screen at all times, but it apparently has to be there for the app to work, and 2) the developer is not responsive to emailed questions.",
      "Android 10 broke this app, and yet it still says that it is compatible with my device. Spent $2 on a non functioning app. Tried setting the app as the default spam and call blocker app but that did not work. If this was free, fine. I get it. It's hard to keep things up to date. But stop taking money from people that can't use the app...",
      "I'm revising my rating here. Initially I reported it was not blocking calls as well as it used too. Turns out with the latest Android update, this app was not set as my default call blocking app. I uninstalled and reinstalled, I set it as my default blocker, and now it's working as expected.",
      "App use to worn great but now it doesn't block any calls at all. It shows a notification of blocking it but the call still comes through. The developer doesn't even respond to emails. App is completely useless now. Take your money somewhere else becasue they don't care once they get it from you."

      "Your mileage WILL vary. I have over 7 years of whatsapp messages and media files. That's 135000 files and over 12gb. That's 5 hours to place the files in my android phone, another 6 hours for Wazzap to convert them. If it works in the end, great. If not, reset the phone and try again, maybe do a few small things differently. If you have only text messages and/or you dont have that much media, then this app will probably work MUCH better for you. That said, their CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS AMAZING.",
      "It worked well for the most part, I followed the instructions exactly, all my messages seem to be there, along with the media. Sadly, none of the links shared between the people I messaged and I were saved, it seems I can't even view links in general, if the past links are gone, I'd at least like a way to view current and future ones. Please help if you have a way to fix it.",
      "I honestly never write reviews but this app is great. I have also never paid for an app and this was so worth it. I switched from Iphone 6 to Google Pixel 4 and did not know where to even begin since there is no way to transfer your whats app messages other than using this app. It is really straightforward but you might run into some hiccups, not because of the app but because its pretty easy to miss things. I emailed support and they helped me with all of my questions and answered back within a day. I just got all of my whats app messages transferred successfully and I am so happy I was able to do it. It just takes a bit of time and patience.",
      "Awesome application. Worth every penny. Got a new Samsung Note 10+ and got devastated when I came to understand that I cannot backup WhatsApp from iPhone to android directly. Searched online and came to know of this app. I would definitely recommend this. While copying over the files to Samsung, I first used the Google drive option and it didn't work fine. Second time I copied over the files directy to the phone by connecting the phone to PC using USB cable. It worked like a charm. Thanks Nicola",
      "It does work as stated. You just need to follow the instructions as stated and it works fine with all groups and individual chats from iPhone reappears on your new Android phone. You will need a Windows or Mac machine to transfer the iPhone chats backup and media to Android. Full details are provided to download additional application on the Windows or Mac machine."

Really don't want to have to take it into the shop to get the distributor set at 0° but I don't know what other app supports CMP Retard for older GMC vehicles. Update: They emailed me and they informed me it won't work on my vehicle and issued a refund.",
      "I could not buzz test my 2001 Ford Diesel with other apps, but it worked well with this application. I wish there were more details on how to use the various features, but it is a great application.",
      "Purchased to diagnose a P0272 on a 6.0 Excursion. Tried doing the buzz test multiple times, and the app repeatedly fails after first injector with an Unknown Error. Does the same thing on my 2004 6.0 F250. I was willing to look past the clunky interface if the buzz test worked. Very disappointed.",
      "Getting \"java.io.ioexception: bt socket closed\" error on my galaxy note 8 and I tried everything I could but it wont connect. I spent $60 on a good bluetooth OBD II reader so I could use this app to do an injector buzz test on my 96 f250 7.3 powerstroke. Stupid app will not work on my phone. Hey developer, update this junky app. Charge $8.99 and you haven't updated it in nearly 5 years. You wasted my time and money.",
      "I downloaded this to my galaxy s10 to buzz test my 7.3. Was notified it wasnt up to date with the current android os and I could not get it to connect to my bluetooth obdii."

      "Great app. Best wifi hotspot app I've found, & I've tried many! (Of course, it only works on rooted phones.) If you have root & want a portable wifi to take anywhere, this is the app for you. However with my phone provider, Metro PCS, on T-Mobile network, I have to start my VPN first before starting Tether Router. (And under settings, the \"VPN Route\" must be checked.) then wifi works fine. If no VPN running, metro blocks signal. ( They want you to buy their wifi, so they make more money!) Enjoy!",
      "used this for years. Rooted and everything. one day I went to use it and the send receive yellow numbers wouldn't show and I had to re turn off always allow scanning even though I never touched it. running note 3 on kit kat. Now it doesn't work. it connects with no internet. has to be a setting in my phone. is it in developing options?"

It didn't work straight away as I had overlooked the auto start permission. Ryan was extremely helpful with email support until all was working. Simple and effective alert app. This app has been improved with additional tones, enabling me to set rules for a callout/stand down/stand by. Has worked reliably since installation. An update feature in app would be perfect.",
      "Works. I am a volunteer lifeboat crew. We have a pager and also receive a text message when tasked. My pager is unreliable so I rely on the text. This works. Treat and hasn't missed a rescue text yet. It works at wakening me in the middle of night. Only thing I would like to see added if more options for alarms although not required as the alarm is loud and annoying enough to get attention Thanks",
      "Initially I couldn't get it to work on my Huawei P20 lite, but a couple of emails to the developer, who was exceptionally helpful, ensured that I got it working correctly. Does exactly what I need it to do and it will give me emergency alerts if phrases that I predetermine are received via email, SMS etc. Thanks.",
      "Really nice app, very straight forward to set up and it works reliably. I'm using it to wake up even in the night when we have an alarm for our volunteer lifeboat. The only thing I'm missing are more sound options, but that's a minor issue.",
      "Great App. Just what I was looking for. Needs two basic improvements though: rules are too simple need logical and/or for title/body, need ability to change sound and maybe control the volume. Otherwise would have been 5 starts."

    "description":"This app teaches you to 'receive' Morse code.\r\n\r\nIt starts with two letters and automatically adds more when it understands that you are ready.\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest and most efficient way to learn Morse code as the app focuses on the practice you need next, instead of wasting your time with stuff you already know or confusing you with stuff that you still don’t.\r\n\r\nThe original idea comes from Ward K9OX (http://c2.com/morse/).\r\n\r\nBy default the app uses the 'Koch' method letter sequence and starts with the first two letters: K and M. But you can use any of the methods available and find the one that suits more your likings. There's also a training program for the top 40 words used during a CW QSO.\r\n\r\nAround each letter you have a circle chart showing how high is your error score. It starts from 100% (full circle) and lowers as you start guessing letters right and increases when you are wrong or you take too much time to recognise them.\r\n\r\nTo start the training, simply press the PLAY button on the top right of the display.\r\n\r\nAt this point the app will start playing tones. Press the one that you think corresponds to the tone. If you are wrong, the app will let you know by playing an 'error' sound. If you are right, the app will continue by picking up another letter or word. Once you'll become good enough with the active letters, the app will enable a new one following the method selected.\r\n\r\nYou can decide to put the training lesson on hold by pressing the PAUSE button. Or stop it by pressing the STOP button. If you want to have an automatic stop after a certain amount of minutes, you can set the SESSION TIME in the settings.\r\n\r\nWhile not training, you can tap on any key or word and listen to its tone to start to get used to it even outside of the training session.\r\n\r\nYou can access the SETTINGS by tapping the 'hamburger icon' on the top left.\r\n\r\nYou can look at your top 10 scores by tapping BEST SCORES in the left menu.\r\n\r\nImportant: you can use the app in both landscape and portrait mode!\r\n\r\nEnjoy learning Morse code!",

      "This is probably the best morse trainer I've tried so far but I have a few reservations. I want to be able to read morse at a reasonable speed and although it takes a lot of concentration and time I hope it will pay off in the end. The bits I don't like is the unforgiving points system particularly when people are getting started. I often at this stage end with - 1800 points after a practice session. Surely wrong 'guesses' could be scored at zero points. This wouldn't be so dispiriting.",
      "This app has worked far better than any I've tried (and I've tried a LOT). I wish it would focus more on the letters I struggle with before moving to a different one but I changed the minimum percentage to get right before moving on. That helps some. Maybe have me repeat a missed letter 5 times before cycling through others? Otherwise I really like this app. UPDATE: NOW..this app is terrible! Previous version was great but it's really mucked up now. Doesn't give hints when you get one wrong.",
      "Will keep. Nice for learning. Used to learning visual instead of auditory and this will help getting the knowledge (E is dot) into practice (hearing short sound => E). Very good. Maybe add word modus?",
      "I love this app with only one exception. If a letter plays a second time and you enter the letter as it is playing then the next letter plays instantly with no spacing. The two letters run together and this makes the next letter unintelligible.",
      "It does exactly what it portends to do, and does it well. However, the result is that I learn the keyboard positions of the sounded letters rather than the letters. If it spoke the name of the letter after it had been correctly selected, that might have helped. It would also help to have a keyer so that I could practice forming the sounds of the letters, and also have the app judge the intelligibility of my keying. I regret getting this app."

Also, can you add an option for a sound alert and termination when my phone disconnects from WiFi, so I don't accidentally use my (expensive) data connection? Thanks, keep up the good work!",

      "I love it. It does everything I needed to do syncing folders from my phone to my PC, individually, on a schedule, with options like verifying that I'm on Wi-Fi and charging. The only negative was that I spent quite a while trying to figure out how to make it work because it wouldn't out of the box. I figured out that you have to enable SMB version 1 on the PC. Which Microsoft just disabled because it's very very old and has some vulnerabilities. I hope they update it to handle SMB v3 soon.",
      "Unfortunately it's NOT reliable. You can corrupt your data :-(. 1. It happens often that if I delete files on mobile while I'm offline then upon reconnecting online the files are re-downloaded from cloud instead of being deleted on cloud. It's random unfortunately. 2. I got one file corrupted. The connection broke during upload transfer and the file is now 0 KB both on mobile and in the cloud. I would not recommend this program then as it partially messes with your data.",
      "Android 10, the instasync feature still works!!! As does everything else afaict. Amazing this app still works despite not being updated, I fear the day it wont, but so far still connects to pcloud and still stays in background with min battery usage. For those who don't know u need to \"disable battery optimization\" under android app settings for foldersync or your schedules and instasync will fail to run.",
      "Usually reliable, but decided last night to suddenly reupload all my photos again to Onedrive. Hit some bug somewhere, I guess. Software is not updated in more than 1.5 year. So not recommended to buy anymore. Update... OneDrive sync is not working anymore at all.",
      "I've tried a whole of sync manager apps and FolderSync is the best. Lots of functionality, customization and comparable with a very large selection of cloud services and standard sources (e.g. LAN, FTP, etc.). I'm currently using the paid version. Bravo to the programmers."

Decodes  the websdr beautifully. Open websdr via Firefox find a signal ,then open droid rtty and you will find a panoramic display of signals, same applies to droid psk.

Just have increased the space between words to 20, to give me a slightly longer break :) Copying actual QSO has taken a bit, but now getting 85%, callsigns were hardest, also adding numbers has added further difficulty, but overall very happy. Thanks 73.",
      "It doesn't display the letter that it's beeping until after it's finished with that letter and started with the next, so you can't easily learn what it's doing in real time. That's not how I learn, so it's basically useless. Had potential, except that when I hear the beep and look at the letter, I'm always one off.",

      "Works, but the way of handling device contacts is too convoluted. Can't simply use device contact to call - call goes to built in phone, not Acrobits. Trying to create a new contact creates it in Device, and there is no easy way to add device contact to Softphone account. I don't have time for this!",
      "I must have tried all free apps before I decided to pay for this one. I should've started with this app. It is the only app I tried that works flawlessly, has good sound quality, is fully integrated with the native dialer and doesn't add a constant buzzing noise in my headset when not on a call. I'm using it with a voice.ms SIP. Strongly recommend.",
      "Tons of annoying bugs and bad design issues, but app works as advertised and sound quality is good. Worst of all: when you tap on a contact, number dialed is randomly chosen by app within contact, no choice given, so app could call pager when I want to dial mobile.",
      "I decided to try a different VoIP client when my previous one, Bria, was not alerting on incoming calls. I thought that since they have push that it was simply the best I could hope for. Acrobits's push service works for incoming calls though. I also love that it integrates with the native Android dialer. I was worried that it wouldn't work on Android Pie on my Galaxy S10 after reading some negative reviews, but I'm happy to say that it works perfectly.",
      "I looked at virtually all of the SIP soft phone apps in the Play Store and this is the only one to support multiple VOIP accounts and properly and useably integrate with the stock dialer.  After pressing the call icon, it pops up a dialog box displaying your GSM account and your currently selected VOIP account to choose from for the dialed call.  Only complaint is that you can't select which VOIP account to use n this dialog if you have multiple VOIP accounts.  Plus, it seems to behave consistently in this manner whether or not the Acrobits app is running or not.. ' Setup is as simple as the best of the competition,  Only complaint here is that the extensive list of clients is not ordered.  There is, however, a search feature to find the desired provider.  Setup options in every category are more extensive than I've found elsewhere and better organized as well..  Sound quality seems fine, although I'll need more use to properly evaluate that.  Would give it 5 stars if not for my complaints, it's relatively steep cost and the fact I would rate the best of its competition no higher than 2 stars.  NTL, the cost is worth it."

DO NOT USE IT WITH Torque as Torque and Remote EX fight over the Bluetooth connection. As soon as I ran the app outside of Torque (with Torque shutdown completely), it worked. Other considerations: One reviewer said that the automobile needs to be turned off for this to work. This is the state that I tested and it worked. Will require more testing to be sure.",
      "Really hoping this world work. Had it installed on an iPhone but it never worked. Gave the android version a shot and still doesn't work. Tried Bluetooth and WiFi OBD2 but still not joy. Contacted the developer but heard nothing back. Still hopeful but not going to hold my breath...",

It charges people money for something that Android has had built in for free for at least the last 2 iterations.  I have already uninstalled. Luckily I didn't pay for it.  If you want to make a useful app then create one that turns on the Hotspot when a specific action happens. i.e. When. Connection to Bluetooth, or opening an app.",

      "nothing wrong with this but why pay for a browser, suppose it's for your settings are differant, coz crome can't block all the adds. this seems to be working for me, why 5 star, Coz I got it free and it blocks adds unlike crome, also I can use duck and go. for my private personal search.. New request what about casting to chromecast that would be the icing on the cake lol x.",
      "STOP DOWNLOAD THIS APP this is a unbelievable useless app that i ever seen. So simple no dark mode no great bookmark list so slow speed like normal free browsers if u open it just it's type panel and setting and the setting u can't see anything just .search engine. Are u fa*king kidding me? Never recommend this app go install uc browser",
      "Not bad. I'd say it's a solid 4 Star app, definitely appreciate the small download / apk size. Only real issue with functionality I've noticed is it's failure to clear the cache when exiting the app, even when it's set to clear in the settings. Deducting 1 Star because quite a few reviews are obviously fake. What's up with all the fake reviews anyway dev? Don't deny it! UPDATE: Too many fakes to count! Nearly all of them start off with \"Private browser Pro\" Changing rate to 1 Star for denying it",
      "Solid 4.9, well done. Small apk size, built-in vpn and minimalistic design. Also I've noticed some features, that might be helpful for further user experience: 1. When u scroll to the top of the page and scroll again, it refreshes the page. 2. Dark theme. Strongly recommend to use this app.",
      "May be good for \"one shot\" views for specific web pages, but this app is waaaaay too unstable to be my daily driver. It crashes too frequently and, being a privacy browser, loses all of the tabs and history, unless you go into settings to save them. But that kinda defeats the purpose of a privacy browser. Perhaps those could be encrypted and unlocked via password or fingerprint when restarting the browser?"

The reason for not giving 5 starts is the UI could be better but most importantly the speaker phone button on the Pc app does NOT enable the speaker phone on android 9 pie, however all the rest call, volume and sms work.

      "I've spent quite a bit of time experimenting trying to remote into my IC-7100, VNC, Skype , FLDigi etc. but RC Forb is a breeze in comparison and the best $10 I've ever spent on an app, worth loads more in my book. Absolutely awesome, if you can't stretch the $300 for the RigPi this is the next best thing. Initially not apparently obvious you can control your own rig as well as others but the penny soon drops, the trouble its too simple, it just works! These folks deserve a H-U-G-E pat on the back, does everything it says on the tin and more, can't fault it. THANKYOU!!!",
      "Great application! It will be very useful, if there is availability to add font increase option.",
      "It is a great app. Those complaining about not being able to transmit clearly do not understand the concept. One thing that certainly can be improved is sending CW \"as you type\" similar to PC client. Used wnen travelling in different parts of the world. Worked fine every time.",
      "The software worked except for access to my Mike on my Google pixel 2. The new Android software does not seem to work with the new software on my phone. 73. Hank. K9LZJ",
      "Great software for Amateur radio remote. You just have to read the pdf manual or watch youtube video to help you make it work. Ones I got it running the sound was awesome and operators gave me good audio reports and they tought i was on my HF radio but when they found out I was on my android phone they said awesone audio! LoL. Works very good and great Edit and control options so your HF radio wount be burn if you share your radio! also works with HDR and others softwares 73's & have fun!"

Edit: The developer sent a response to create a support ticket. I already did that and also mentioned the support call number - this shows the amount of effort that they even took to read this review. Shame - do not download this app.",
      "I was using it in my iPhone for 3 months and it worked flawlessly. Once I gave my iPhone away and moved to Android I had to buy the app again. Although I can use the same number again, paying for it a second time is unfair. Kindly refund my money paid for switching to Android.",
      "This would be the biggest \"ripoff\" since Bernie Madeoff. First off C$8 & change to \"buy\" the app. Then after they have you, it's C$11 & change to remove the F........g ads. Then C$5 for international call time. C$24+ you get first base. Then the kicker, 29c a minute to call Australia. I could call the North Pole from the F......g moon for less than that. Don't waste your money.",
      "A little bit of static and they had a slight difficulty hearing me, but otherwise worked as advertised perfectly -- $5 for a voip solution so that I could make call from a Canadian number worked perfectly. Thank you!",

Alternatively, you can control the locations and callsigns that you don't want to see.\r\n\r\nAlerts - The app will monitor on-the-air activity and alert you when a desired region or callsign is heard.  When you use alerts you have the option to allow this app to setup a reply in WSJT-X.

You can view propagation changing over time.\r\n\r\n**Important** - You must configure WSJT-X or JTDX correctly before this app will display anything.

      "So the app functionality works. But since it pulls from its own database of 10M or so numbers (per dev reply) it finds nothing. There is 400M+ people in US + probably 200M business numbers. Basically if you have 1.6% p to see a name with a number. It is convenient to lookup numbers via app by sending number do google , but thats 90% spam... Unfortunate that a good app dies due to useless data it relies on.",
      "This app gives zero information on any number. All it does is show the number. Completely useless. Uninstalling.",
      "I've had this app for years. Always proved reliable",
      "It detects such a low number of calls, that it wasn't worth buying. 99% of calls say “unknown\", which anyone with a brain cell left should be able to figure out the caller is unknown without an app.",
      "Doess't identify any calls as much any more. It would be a good idea to have an option for the users to enter the caller id to help update the back end database it pulls from. If more than one person puts in the same or similar name to a number, the back end should auto update. This should fix the constent \"unknown caller\" issue, since the database is not pulling from a 3rd party list. Also the app is no longer creating a call log as of a week ago on my moto z2 force. Just my 2 cents."

    "description":"It’s not a secret that any cell phone can be wired as well as phone number can be substituted. IMSI catchers are very cheap and popular devices now that can do both of these. But there are also other ways to violate your privacy through cell network.\r\n\r\nHere are three main wiring methods described below.\r\n\r\n1. Spyware (or Scumware)\r\n\r\nThe software you install on your mobile phone can tape your phone calls, capture photo and video not only when you talk or use the camera application but in standby mode as well.\r\n\r\nProtection: you need to be careful installing new software and check whether it has access to your camera and microphone or not and also to internet, phone calls, SMS etc. Always check the producing company as well if it is trustworthy or not.\r\n\r\nSpyware might also be installed on the device without your disclosure. Such apps are prohibited on Google Play. Thus they are usually apps that can only be installed from an APK file, they transmit your location, calls or messages to a person that want to wire you. In the list of the applications they usually look like fishing websites addresses such as ‘Googel Services’, ‘Google Drlve’ with the same app icon as the similar real applications. The package names are also usually very similar to any popular application, so it might be difficult to find them. It might be a collegue, a relative or a phone service technician who may install such an app on a user’s cellphone.\r\n\r\nEagle Security allows you to get the full list of the applications on your device. You can check the permissions they requested and find out which apps require multiple permissions that let them to spy you. \r\n\r\nEagle Security also provides functionality to disable camera and/or microphone on your phone to make it impossible for any spyware to use them when you want to be sure that your phone is not listening or watching you.\r\n\r\nThis app uses the Device Administrator permission.\r\n\r\n2. Substitution of base station\r\n\r\nLately this method has become very popular because IMSI catchers become very cheap and easy to buy. Wiring kit can be placed next to you not far than in 500 meters and all the cell phones in the action radius connect to the fake station due to its powerful signal. IMSI catchers are ofter used with a jamming station to suppress all the cell towers and make all the near phones to register in the network via the IMSI catcher.\r\n\r\nSuch kits could be not bigger than an attache case and can be easily used without your notice.\r\n\r\nYour can’t know that the base station was substituted because the new station transmits all the data to the real one and calls work in the normal way. Everybody can buy such compex at affordable price.\r\n\r\nProtection: tracking all the stations your cell phone connects to. Eagle Security checks the signature of a station, mostly tapping complexes have substandard signatures. And it also tracks positions of stations. If a station appears in different places or appears in a new place near to a station placed in the same place before it’d be marked as a suspicious and all the other users will be informed if they connect this station.\r\n\r\nConnection to a suspicious base station doesn’t mean that somebody is tapping you for sure. But it’s strongly recommend not to use your phone when it’s connected to untrustworthy base station.\r\n\r\n3. The third method\r\n\r\nHaving contacts in security agencies you can get an official allowance to wire a cell phone. In many countries it’s enough to give a person a witness status in any judicial case. The person will never even know about that because such tapping is formally legal.\r\n\r\nProtection: voice and message encryption. You can use software for secured calls and messaging by independent developers such as Telegram.\r\n\r\nEagle Security helps our users to protect themselves from the first and the second methods described above higly efficiently.\r\n\r\nWith Eagle security you can monitor and explore cell network around you and control access of the applications on your device to your hardware.",

      "Awesome app. Takes research to understand the concept behind it and I'm by no means an expert now but it's enough to get me questioning at least. Recommended - what to do if dodgy tower signals picked up + alert functionality maybe? (despite strain on phone resources). I used the free version for months but decided to go unlimited. If trouble installing unlimited - don't worry about Store cache - deactivate free version through Device Manager, delete free version then Store\\Library boom! =]",
      "The purpose of this app is to check that your cell phone is connected to a legitimate cell tower as opposed to a fake tower that might be setup by a government entity or criminal snoop to to intercept communications. I recommend Googling up Electronic Frontier Foundation IMSI catcher for a couple of article that explain it in detail. The app has a couple of other security features but works as advertised for its primary purpose. The paid version seems to be the same but happy to support.",
      "I never knew the dangers of IMSI catchers and the use of Stingray surveillance were used so frequently by law enforcement. This app is great. A video tutorial showing what to look for would be very helpful as well. Thx EAGLE Security",

A narrow band DSP filter can be set for the frequency of the Morse code tones by tapping the waterfall. The DSP filter is followed by an automatic gain control (AGC) to compensate for changing signal strengths.\r\nThe detected signal will be shown as a graph and several algorithms will then detect the speed of the Morse code and convert them into readable text. Speeds of less than 4 Wpm (Words per Minute) to more than 50 Wpm can be decoded.\r\n\r\nFor any question please visit our new forum at http://www.wolphi.com/forum/\r\n\r\nThis is the first version of Morse Decoder.\r\nIt has been tested on several Android devices and it performed very well or even better than PC based decoding software. However, since we are not able to test the performance on all 150+ Android devices there is the possibility that Morse Decoder will not work on all devices. If Morse Decoder doesn’t work on your device you can uninstall Morse Decoder within 15 Minutes for a full refund (This is the time frame given by Google and I am not able to change it). If the 15 minutes passed and you are not happy with Morse Decoder email me as soon as possible at info@wolphi.com. Please include your name and the model of your phone in the email. I will then refund you the money as fast as possible. It is important that you include the model of your device.

      "Terrific app. I installed the free version first, to check it out. It works very, very well - even establishing VNC connections over a secure channel (SSH, in my case) to hosts behind a firewall is straightforward to do, once you know your way around the app. I decided to get the pay version, not necessarily because I want to get extra features or get rid of the marketing window, but because I think that the developer deserves it. Notice that migrating from the free one to the pay version is painless, thanks to the Import/Export Settings capability available in both versions. Very highly recommended.",

      "This app was working fine... but something must has change. When I try to retrieve or send messages on the private box it comes back stay wrong password... I send an email several days ago asking for some assistance to get this resolved and I haven't received any response.. I guess I would not mind this so much but I paid for this app and would expect some type of communication....",
      "The app was great but I just made the switch to new phone and now my messages wont transfer from this app to new phone for some reason. The messages dont even show up on my default app.",
      "I love this messenger to death. The only problems I have with it, is that I don't have a SIM card, so I am unable to use it to its full potential without having to beg a random pedestrian to install it so I can act like I can just to comfort my empty wallet :( | ; however, according to my speculation, it is very frequent but lowish on the RAM usage (while application is not open), as well as when I disable some permissions, the system notifies me (6.0.1) that it is outdated and it may not work as intended, when it is indeed up-to-date. That's all the quasi-bugs that I have seen. I would love to see a burner number system so you can online call, even without a carrier, because I'd fully use this. I'm tired of integrating burner apps with messaging apps. Anyways, thank you so much for developing this app! Keep up the good work! I look forward to seeing future updates.<\\>",
      "First, i installed textu (not pro), its was good but have ads so i bought pro version (Php 280.00) ...but a pro version was very disappointing because i cant send messages...always saying \"Failed to send\" \"Some issues need your attention\" i waste my 280 pesos...not pro version is better but with ads...do not buy pro version",
      "Does the job. 1 suggestion: it could be even better if i was able to customize each private contact indivitually; meaning when private contact 1 text me, I want it to pop up a blue icon & private contact 2 a Green icon so when i see the icon, ill know which private contact it is."

      "Just the best. Has dark mode, works with bookmarklets, scrolls with vol buttons & features easy 2 finger zoom. Also very important the flow text function, finally all the text is visible on phone screens... Also to my knowledge the only browser for Android which allows you to use bookmarklets easily... Bravo & thx",
      "I don't even know how long I've been using Naked Browser Pro, but it has to be 6 to 8 years or more. In that time and on several devices, I've had very few problems. It is simply the fastest and most reliable browser I've used, and I have tried many. Not sure why I haven't left a review before, but any time I try a different browser, I come back to NB Pro within a day or two. So... Apparently its the best one.",
      "Awesome browser, one issue. Since some time after the last update the zoom out function when using desktop client doesn't work in portrait mode anymore. Tested on original LG Android 9 OS on LG g7 thinq and on custom rom also based on Android 9 on xiaomi mi 8. It would be really great if this gets updated. Could it be an issue with Google Webview? Since it worked a few months after the last NB update and suddenly stopped working a week ago or so, without updating NB.",
      "Used this since it's inception in 2012... I can't download anything, it will DL but I cannot open the file once DL'ed. I used Bromite, and I had no problems with the same file. Emailed them, no answer...",
      "Okay update again: looks like it's updated and most issues has been corrected good job. But since it released NB never had the ability to share images, you can only share a link, why? Nearly every browser has this feature. Please add this. Thanks."

Moreover the PREMIUM version take a lot of time entering the settings page. Never had any answers by developer. Underclassed to 1 star: * no answers from developer * Pro version and Premium version show different values (for example HP) * fuel consumption values are inverted (km/l shows a value in l/100 and vicevers)",

      "This is a very comprehensive trainer, one I will enjoy using. My only issue is that the RSS feed output starts jumping from the top of the screen down to the bottom, then back up again between each word, once the text reaches the bottom of the window and has to start scrolling the visible window. This is stomach churning if you're trying to read while listening to the code. Otherwise, this is a really good tutor.",
      "App is great, however it stays in idle mode after closing and drains my battery. Have not found a way to get the app out of idle mode so it closes and does not drain my battery. Will rate higher once this is fixed.",
      "Excellent so far! Ive been looking for a way to learn morse for fifty years. i discovered the Koch method which seemed made for smartphones. Within a very short space of time of installing KMT Pro i found i was \"seeing\" letters in my head from the sound without trying to decode the dots and dashes. A way to go yet but very impressed so far.",
      "works real well on my samsung tablet with a pair of headphones. Sound quality is ok it doesnt seem to be distorted. Sometimes when I miss a character it gives me credit for a correct answer. Not sure whats up there. It takes a lot of practice to learn the code, but this seeems to help.",
      "The best morse trainer I came across. The keyboard input is extremely useful when \"on the go\" and no writing pad at hand. The statistics and the ability to practice with RSS feeds make this the perfect app for me."

      "So I tried the free version first, after being disappointed by others I tried and the free version worked without trouble. I bought the Pro version and couldn't connect and the nicely written induction from the help menu helped resolve the matter quickly. Remember to uninstall the free version after installing the Pro version, to avoid confusing which you've clicked on. This is a very easy tool to use and it allows for encryption, which some of the hotspots don't. It's a worthwhile purchase."

    "title":"Lightning Browser Plus - Web Browser",
    "description":"Lightning Browser Plus is a simple, fast web browser that focuses on design, security, and efficiency. It uses material design, doesn't track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.\r\n\r\nWhat this contains over the free version:\r\n● Unlimited open tabs\r\n● Custom ad blocking source controls, choose from default hosts file, local hosts file, or remote hosts file\r\n\r\n● Ad blocking - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.\r\n\r\n● Design - Lightning's interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser's chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there's a mode for you.\r\n\r\n● Speed - By utilizing the WebKit rendering engine that comes built into your Android device, Lightning can ensure a swift, lightweight experience.\r\n\r\n● Privacy - Use Incognito Mode to browse without leaving a footprint, download Orbot and turn on TOR proxy support to mask your identify and location, use StartPage or DuckDuckGo for your search engine, or disable settings that you think leave you at risk. Whatever your concern, Lightning will try to help.\r\n\r\n● Features - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check.

    "descriptionHTML":"Lightning Browser Plus is a simple, fast web browser that focuses on design, security, and efficiency. It uses material design, doesn&#39;t track you, give you lots of options to protect your privacy. It gets out of the way of the user. I built this browser because I wanted something better.<br><br>What this contains over the free version:<br>● Unlimited open tabs<br>● Custom ad blocking source controls, choose from default hosts file, local hosts file, or remote hosts file<br><br><b>● Ad blocking</b> - Blocking ads is a core feature of Lightning Browser, meant to improve the speed and security of your browsing experience.<br><br><b>● Design</b> - Lightning&#39;s interface was carefully crafted so you can browse as efficiently as possible. Tabs and Bookmarks are all tucked neatly away in side drawers, only a swipe away, allowing maximum screen viewing with minimal interference from the browser&#39;s chrome. Dark Mode, Light Mode, Color Mode, Night Mode... Anyway, whatever you like, there&#39;s a mode for you.<br><br><b>● Speed</b> - By utilizing the WebKit rendering engine that comes built into your Android device, Lightning can ensure a swift, lightweight experience.<br><br><b>● Privacy</b> - Use Incognito Mode to browse without leaving a footprint, download Orbot and turn on TOR proxy support to mask your identify and location, use StartPage or DuckDuckGo for your search engine, or disable settings that you think leave you at risk. Whatever your concern, Lightning will try to help.<br><br><b>● Features</b> - Full-screen, check. AdBlock, check. Inverted Rendering, check. All the search engines you want, check. Search Suggestions, Bookmarks, History, User Agents, Reading Mode, whatever you need, Lightning does it.<br><br><b>● Open-source</b> - Just as Android open-source, so is Lightning. I believe that the best software is built when communities come together to engineer the best solution. Head over to the repository on GitHub to contribute or translate.<br><br><b><u>Permissions</u></b><br><b>● permission.INTERNET:</b> Needed to access the internet for browsing<br><b>● permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</b> Needed for downloading files and backing up data<br><b>● permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</b> Needed for downloading files and restoring data<br><b>● permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION:</b> Needed for sites that want your location (you can deny location access)<br><b>●permission.RECORD_AUDIO:</b> Utilized by WebRTC, turned off by default<br><b>●permission.CAMERA:</b> Utilized by WebRTC, turned off by default<br><br><b>Talk to me on Twitter:</b> https://twitter.com/RestainoAnthony<br><br><b>Fork me on GitHub:</b> https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser",

The demo can be replaced with the paid version via the market without any further setup on your computer.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Does NOT require rooting\r\n\r\n- One-time purchase fee -- upgrades are free via the Market.\r\n\r\n- Uses USB for longer battery life and greater speed\r\n\r\n- Supports Windows (XP/Vista/7/32-bit/64-bit), Mac OS X 10.5 (or later), and Ubuntu/Linux (32-bit and 64-bit)\r\n\r\n- Written in C (NOT Java) for efficiency, speed, and lower power consumption.\r\n  * Handles hundreds of simultaneous connections.  Klink can take on the most demanding applications.\r\n  * Is fast and capable of handling 4g speeds: can reach 30mbps in real-world conditions on capable phones.\r\n\r\n- Can transparently rewrite \"User-Agent\" headers so that your PC browser will look like a mobile device when browsing web pages. This can save bandwidth by conveniently defaulting to the mobile version of websites.\r\n\r\n- Designed so that network traffic effectively originates from the phone.  This differs from rooted devices, which forward packets directly from the PC.\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n\r\nAfter installing and running Klink, please tap \"Set up your Computer\" and follow the instructions.  Klink requires the installation of a small companion program on your PC in order to tether without rooting, so following the step-by-step guide is suggested.

Now the volume rocker defaults to page up/down with no way to change it. Too bad they took away a good feature for voice input support (who would use this in a terminal emulator?) and the ability to change  the text and background colors. I'm giving an extra star because the developer was very responsive to my concerns. I'm uninstalling and trying Glink."

      "You need to watch the attached video to figure out how to adjust the Font and ICON size. They ARE easily adjustable, however you need really good hand/eye coordination to get the size slider to the exact spot you want. It took me a couple of days to realize that the preview in the install section actually applies in real time to the badge you have chosen. It works great, so BRAVO to the developer for option. Hopefully others will figure this out quicker (and easier) than I did.  :-)"

If they manually move you, instant fix. My installer has rang them many times & the issue is the same and we have fantastic coverage where we live. But it's at their side, the issue is. I like the app & just wish the service was as reliable & that the service telecoms elements worked as they should.",
      "This app does what it supposed to do but it's extremely slow and very old fashioned. The UI of this app reminds me of C, C++ days. It's not a big effort to develop a new UI, customers are paying for this app, please do something to improve user experience.",
      "Great app have it over 4 years now and never had any problems, but would like to know how to update app as seen someone elses app and it's more modern. But good all so far. Great to have access to alarm system if away so one can turn alarm off if need be, without annoying the neighbour's if there is a fault.",
      "Brilliant app, but it needs an urgent update!! It worked perfectly on my Samsung S7, but on Samsung S10, it doesn't notify me anymore of alarms. Which makes an Alarm app a little useless, to put it mildly. I am sure that the problem is with the new version of Android, but someone has to bring the app up to speed again!! ASAP, please!",
      "I have just upgraded to the hyawie P30 Pro and the app is not working at all . It works fine on my iPad and my old Samsung A6 and HTC and my wife's Samsung S8 , from other negative reviews it appears I am not on my own. When is the update to the App due???"

      "Best app I've used for email by far! The company I work for was forcing us to use Company Portal/Outlook/etc.. while forcing us to allow them administrative rights on our personal mobile phone. With MailCal I no longer need the additional bloat wear or big brother looking over me. Another plus is my work calendar syncs with my Google calendar, I know have 1 place to look for meetings/events.   Great job, thank you!",
      "Good app. I use it to get work's mail and calendar without need to make the workplace admin of phone. issues: 1. app keeps sync in background even when i set not to. 2. search is not very good. 3. calendar does not sync.",
      "I am using this app since 2016. But now Microsoft supports 2 factor authentication. 2nd factor being a SMS sent to phone. There is no provision in this app to handle it. So, it's useless now.",
      "Been great so far the last month or so ive had it. It looks basic but is very funtional. Does everything i need it to. No other apps would allow me to login to this specific owa so it's a god send. Just hope it doesnt end up prevented somehow."
