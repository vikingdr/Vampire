I have been sending reports and messages for weeks now to no avail. I don't want to go through the trouble of closing my email account and go to another service, I JUST WANT YOU TO FIX THE APP!!! Hopefully, SOMEONE will see my post and are kind enough to respond!!!",
      "I use gmail all the time but I noticed on this update before last that it took away the ability to resize images, at this time when we are more isolated from each other it would be good to be able to reduce the size of pictures to share with friends and family. I used to be able to send over 10 pictures at a time and in sequence, now its max 6 and all over the place.... any chance we could have the resize element back??",
      "I love Gmail. But it never deletes my spam when I tell it to. My emails come thru late. I have to pull the screen down to make it sync. Even though I keep my account clear of old emails and constantly delete anything that I'm done reading. I'm still having problems. So I have to uninstall all updates and reinstall the app weekly. Just so it works properly for a few days.",
      "gmail now crashes no matter what fix I apply. Also...I've lost the ability to make this the default, or to default to another email app so I can open my hyperlinks. Every time I click a link it crashes and I never changed my settings. This update is the worst one ever. I'm switching everything off of Chrome, because I live and work by my email. I cannot function! And yet...ALLL of my emails are GMAIL! I want a divorce. After 3 weeks of complaints, you would think someone would get the message.",
      "Something weird has been going on with my gmail Android app for some days. It does not open. Absolutely nothing happens when I click on the App button except a totally blank white screen with only the + sign for new email on the bottom right. I have no idea what to do. Please help me, Gmail is essential for my work. Update: Fixed it by uninstalling and reinstalling all updates. Leaving this review here for the record."

I don't want everyone calling my cellphone; close friends, family etc yes! Business contacts, retail memberships, creditors, not at all. Nothing sucks more when trying to relax than some a-hole blowing up your phone. Got to love Google for this service! @ pthis price this service cannot be beat. Thanks Google Team!! Sincerely, Moe",
      "Cant give it a 5... works great so far, definitely notifies me when I missed a call and it went to voicemail, but I want to either extend the number of \"rings\" before it goes to voicemail, OR disable the voicemail feature and review my missed calls! Either option would be good, and allow me the time to get to the phone to answer it! I am not so young that it is attached to my hand, and it seems to go to voicemail very quickly. Please advise on either option that I would like to utilize!",
      "I've been using Google voice for a while now. I really enjoy having one phone number for everything. I'm not sure if I'm imagining this but it seems like I don't get very many spam calls to my number which is super nice. The search leaves something to be desired and the chrome plugin no longer works."

      "Very buggy. Developing pages and testing against this browser reveals all kinds of caching issues. Even after clearing the cache, the browser doesn't render things properly with missing images and text on some pages. It wouldn't even render a test page with a single img element and nothing else! Quitting the browser and restarting it makes it work properly at first, but as time progresses some elements start to disappear. Very frustrating to use and test pages against. If the devs want examples, I can provide them. Contact me.",
      "Nothing special about it. It's distracting with the surrounding irrelevant information. I don't like my time being wasted. I like efficiency. A clean page with to the point access of the tools I need. The ability to search for and find what I want at that moment, without getting bombarded with odd and ends that stop me from being productive.",
      "What was in that latest update (March 2020)? Google Play kept crashing during the install! It used to be a decent app, but someone has decided that all searches should be saved, which is annoying, the screen gets cluttered with previous searches that I don't want. Why do software writers keep removing sensible and useful features?",
      "Everyone should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, FASTER. It's actually pretty clean and efficient compared to some of the other browser choices that are available out there. You should at least give it a try, since it is designed to work best with the machine that it is installed on",

This browser has come on leaps and bounds over the last year or so. It was initially good, then they tried to fix what wasn't broken, now it's back to its old self again - only better. It's now even more reliable, nice to use and look at"

      "The older versions were simple and easy to use. But, there are things I don't like in this new update. 1. Some gesture controls have been changed. 2. The TABS IN GROUP style seems to be very complex and it is hard to getting used to. 3. Switching between two tabs is not easy like before. So I would be happy if the older layouts are used in the future updates.",
      "I've used this app extensively for years, and I've loved it. Recently, though, they've made a change get in the way you search for images. Once you search by image, and tap, \"View more sizes,\" the following view no longer displays the dimensions for the images. It was a nice touch and one that I really enjoyed, when looking for wallpapers, but now that it's gone, I don't think I'm going to be using this app, anymore.",
      "You need to fix your App. Been getting a lot of error messages for the past month. Apps are often unresponsive and won't open. Not having any of these issues on other Google sponsored browsers like Opera, and none on Bing. Prefer Chrome, but until you get these issues solved I'm switching over to something else. Note I have cleared the cache and data at least 3 or 4 times.",
      "This app is an absolute slap in the face to the user. At a time when MOST people use their mobile phones for everything, this app snatches away all the functionality of the desktop version. There's no easy way to duplicate a tab or close \"all\" or \"other\" tabs just by pressing on the tabs themselves. There is no way to save favorites on the homepage. No quick way to get to bookmarks. And worst of all, no option to have all sites open in desktop by default. Horrible user experience. Disaster!",
      "My chrome has also not been working since the last update, won't open or load any page. Have already uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared data, and followed all the troubleshooting instructions in the support pages. These are not a solution! Please help. I have already checked I'm connected to the internet and have already checked out your community answers, they do not solve the problem. Please don't reply with an unhelpful automated response!"

One little mistake on my end that any other business would be able to fix now means that this app is less than useless for me. :/",
      "This is a very bad application, I installed this application 5 month ago, they asked for a credit card information. I used if a few days and the App says the first month is free. After that few days I didn't use it anymore but they have charged me for 4 month. They didn't send any in-app notifications for charging or emails, despite the fact that they have already the email. On the other side , the settings is a complicated one and you can't find where to go for cancellation.",
      "This is a great app, since I started using Android phone, I have used Skype since then and the best thing about it is video and audio are very clean, which gives good quality, I like it. By using its app and I will always be in touch with it and I hope that things will come up on the sky better and the process will work and on the sky is the very good app,",
      "Terrible - This app does not work on my android tv box. Skype has downloaded but will not allow me to reach the sign in page. A pop up error message suggests checking my internet connection but there is nothing wrong with my WIFI or Ethernet connections. I guess I'm going to be even more socially distant from my family than planned.",
      "They eat up the money you load after a while. They send you email saying if you do not log in, you will loose your credit. If you miss to log in, it totally disappear. There is no way of talking to someone or getting an email address to send message. You are going looptiloop for hours on their site and find no way to contact them."

      "A critical app for active people (runners, cyclists, triathletes, skiers). ANT Radio Service allows things like heart rate monitors, fitness equipment, garmin watches, etc, to connect to your phone & apps using the ANT+ protocol (much more effective than bluetooth and allows multiple connections). It is NOT some secret gov't conspiracy. Man some of you are real pieces of work. Unfortunately with Android Pie, built-in ANT+ seems to have been forgotten, which is a bummer.",
      "How did this app get on my phone and is it spyware? .... Bloatware.... Check permissions.... Yes this is an app that is preinstalled because this company paid Samsung or Google. The permissions to access sensitive information is present. It's funny when the developer has to say the app isn't spyware or bloatware because most of the time that is not true. Open source the code of the app so we, as the users, can see if your claims are true.",
      "STOP TRIPPING!! Its not a radio its FM frequency to connect Smart Watches and Fit Bit type devices so it can communicate with your phone. I bought a Fitbit at Christmas and all of a sudden I see this app on my phone. It didn't come pre-installed on my Samsung S8. It on newer versions now to help make the connection easier for Smart Watches. It helps wrist devices and the app on your phone communicate. It's NOT Spyware, Bloatware or adware.",
      "I understand what people are explaining about the app being preinstalled, and it is supposed to be helping the phone. However, I get paranoid easily especially since I opened a photo stating that people should be aware of a particular URL link because it deals with sex trafficking and THIS APP RANDOMLY STARTED DOWNLOADING... 🤦🏼‍♀️ if this is really the case then I apologize for my judgement without looking at ALL the reviews and I really do hope it's just a preinstalled app. Thank you.",
      "Let's face some facts. If this app's purpose had been to be helpful to users as opposed to privacy data gathering for others (I'm looking at you, Verizon, Samsung, and developer, et al), we'd be able to delete it if we wanted. Should it be any surprise that the developer assures us that it's entirely harmless? Sheesh!"

      "I thought I was the only one having trouble with my phone since this update!! My phone was working perfectly until the update. I've complained and complained and complained, to no avail. Not sure it is safe to uninstall, but I'm going to try at the risk of loosing everything. If I do, Im off to get an Apple!! I was excited with my new phone which I've had for about 6 months now. Everything was wonderful and then came the update. It has run havoc with my phone!!! What a waste!!! Candace",
      "Google carrier services is designed to assist carriers bringing in new features to the messaging app. It allows MMS and newer features to be used by your carrier. It's not spying on you, and it's not breaking your phone. Look it up if you really have to, or get a custom ROM and remove Google apps all together if you really despise them.",
      "This app is useless!!! It does nothing but mess up the function of my phone!!! Just another way to control what we do and how we do our phones!!!! Not to mention misleading!!!! It has nothing to do with our carriers!!! But it all has to do with Google!!! I've complained to Google about this situation and there is no acception reason explained especially after explaining the control over us how, when and where we use our phone!!! The key words!!! It's designed to study us how, when and where",

Gee, I didn't know that already when I haven't lived in my phone's area code for a decade...",

When I launch the app on my completely up-to-date Android 10 phone, the spinner just spins forever on the app's Verizon branded splash screen. I've left it for an hour and no change. Uninstalled and reinstalled a newer version months later and same behavior. Wishing I hadn't granted it permission to all my contacts now! UNINSTALLED.",
      "Doesnt work with Android 10. Worked before that. Slow to update, so I cancelled that paid service. Not paying for something that doesn't work. I liked how it worked when it was actually working. Won't be resubscribing until it's fixed. Don't waste your time."

      "The video quality and cross platform support is great. With that said there are a few really annoying issues holding this back from a higher score as of the time writing this. 1) You can't seem to add/invite people to an ongoing call. You have to exit the call, create a new group with all people, and the call that group. Really?!? 2) If you have a group call going and it dwindles down to two people it cuts the screen in half for each user instead of full screen with the person you are talking with and small thumbnail for yourself. Fix these two issues and this will be a 5 star app.",
      "I really want to like this app. It have good features, like the low light mode. It works great. But it lacks some fundamental features that it shouldn't. If i made a voice call, i couldn't req for a vid call immediately. I had to end call and call again. If i was in a vid call, i can't change to fon call, and i can't temporarily turn off the camera if i need to. If the other side ends the call, there is no tone to indicates the call was ended. Minor features, but fundamentally important.",
      "I have Duo installed on my android and am attempting to use it on my computer once in a while. When someone calls, it rings on the phone but does not ring on the computer. There is no notification that someone is calling, nor is there any way that alerts me so I can press \"answer\" and pick up the call. I added duo into my notifications on the web browser as the HELP menu instructed with no luck. What do I do next?",
      "Video seems to stutter & freeze much more than other apps like FB messenger or WhatsApp. This iccurs while communicating with others with good wifi at both ends. This forces us to move off Duo and into another app to communicate.",
      "Latest version not working for outgoing calls on my Galaxy S20. Not sure what was done but tried reinstalling the app. Clearing my cache and even resetting my network settings. Whenever I call anyone it just says immediately \"person didn't answer\". It only pops up the incoming call on the other end for about 1 second. The only way is to have them call me back to chat. Very annoying for someone who uses duo everyday. Please fix this Google!"

      "I love this app, it's by far the best there is...and it's still in its infancy stage. This app allows you to dictate and transcribe even under windy conditions. It is extremely accurate when writing out your spoken words, and best of all it allows you to copy and paste your conversation or writings into Google Docs. The developers are spot on, they listen and do what takes to make this the absolute best transcribing app available. I rank it as 4.5 stars. How do I edit my text?",
      "I love this app! I've tried other apps like this one before, but this one is top-of-the-line. I only gave it four stars but that's only because it requires an internet connection. This app was created by Google with that help and input of gallaudet University. It works so well that I'm going to use it all the time! It even transcribes many different languages to such a Spanish. I only have residual hearing a very little of that, and this app is perfect. Way2go Google!",
      "First app of this type which works for me... However, I still have to find out the quickest and fastest way to transfer the text to anozer place. So far, when I'm done with the dictation, I touch the screen with two finger, select all and copy. Then, I have to open either a texting app or Google Doc, paste the text and either text via the texting app or to download the Google Doc. It's faster than typing the whole thing, but it should be simpler. Keep in mind: I need it mostly on chat lines",
      "This app used to work great but now it picks up so much background noise that in a still room , it thinks it hears water running when it's just still air. So frustrating. I used to use this app all the time. I'm dumping it. A bit of advice developer: if it ain't broke, DONT FIX IT!! Stop changing things that dont need to be changed!!!",
      "Painful slow to load after latest update. Used to be instant now few seconds to load. Huge inconvenience when you need it quickly. Often it complained that there is no wifi so it won't work but my LTE is working and fast. Why not use LTE? Want to know if I can use other Google products - bluetooth microphone or nest, etc to follow group conversation?? For example I want to place a microphone on the table in backyard and follow what 3 of my friends are saying on the table."

      "Samsung in limited time sending to and fro notifications to the phone or the internet without any delay is excellent. Even in the peak hours there is only the minimal time for the entire processit takes to get and send to the web all the dataneeded to be pushed either of the sides. On push services I believe Samsung has a tight grip and same goes for the network. Both the services are like hand in glove, Samsung is what it is today, one of the best best brands in the world.",
      "This is a wonderful life changing app by samsung. In all my life I suffered due to lack of push to do any thing. I was not pushed to my real abilities. After I bought a Samsung device everything thing changed. This app constantly pushes me to do the things I was afraid of doing earlier. At the time of pooping if I had difficulty to poop I oppen this app and it helps to push my poop extremely hard. Its a shame that this app is available only for Samsung users.",
      "I have tried time and time again to get this app to work. Actually, I don't think it's the app as much as NOBODY acknowledges my phone service as legit. I have not been able to get push notifications since my LG Volt.",
      "The device does not have sufficient onboard storage capacity to have the app working with ur device especially after the updates. Too many additional apps cannot be moved to the external storage as most other devices are able to. Permanently struggling with very low on board memory after just a few of the standard updates for the onboard apps. And many of the devices own apps cannot be disabled completely or uninstalled if not used.",
      "I want to be able to uninstall and delete this app as well as some others especially if I have no use for them. I like to feel like I have control of my devices and it's more time consuming going through each app and denying permissions over and over."

      "I have it and I use it, and I love it. However the only reason it's not my default messages app, is only because my samsung default app has \"Quick Response\". When I'm driving my taxi, it's nice that I can automatically send a message letting them know im not ignoring them... lol if you guys can get that on your app, I'd be in heaven. Great job tho, guys. It's a great app.",
      "I got this app in order to send/receive texts over wifi. Unfortunately, even after tinkering with it for several hours and reading a lot of troubleshooting articles, I was not able to get this feature to work. Needless to say, I'm disappointed and a bit irritated about the wasted time; I'm now going to uninstall this app and go look for one that actually works.",
      "Great app except it suddenly, without warning assigns default notification settings to every conversation, disregarding the global app settings. When I wipe the data and reconfigure anew it works great for awhile and then bam, all the conversations are back with default notification settings. I can't fix this without going into every conversation and changing the notification settings, one at a time, which is a big job. Thus, I can't use the app.",
      "Only issues I have are this app doesn't light up my screen when I get a text message like the stock one does, and the lack of customization options. I mean really Google? You can't add a few more lines of code to give some options for bubble colors and backgrounds? And I missed a couple texts because I ignored my phone when it dinged because the screen didn't light up till I figured that out. Love the ability to text from my Chromebook though, and it's the only reason I'm keeping it for now.",
      "I really like the functionality of the Google Messages app. However, a MAJOR shortcoming is the inability to automatically purge old messages either by message limit or by age. Since all messages are stored on your phone and not on Google's servers, ultimately the phone's memory use will become excessive - especially given the ability for Messages to send & receive large files and images with RCS. Short of deleting entire ongoing conversations with your contacts - which is rarely desirable - incredibly, there seems to be no other (easy) way to delete old messages except laboriously and manually! The omission of this basic function by Google is unthinkable! It's hard to imagine Google hasn't addressed this. Messaging apps with much less technical expertise and fewer resources than Google include an automatic purge function. Come on, Google, fix this!"

I have emailed back and forth with the developer with no change to the app. I have paid for pranks a few tones but i won't again and i suggest you don't either. Developer: I have contacted you multiple times and you guys just keep telling me to uninstall and install the app back. That doesn't work!!!",

This obviously greatly decreases the chance of anyone answering. Avoid this app.",

      "The app is sadly a huge battery drain. Furthermore the UI is poorly made and not intuitive to use. Answering calls sometimes makes them go to Speaker mode. In the Android app it's not explained properly how to log out of a queue, difficult to find. Call quality is very poor due to low volume, echo and drops in calls. Could use more options like on Windows OS. I'm sorry for the poor review, if the app is updated and the issues are fixed I'm more than willing to change it of course.",
      "I'm using this on Galaxy Note 10 plus - all appears OK until I receive a call. Unable to answer using the Galaxy when the screen is locked.I can only cancel the call. If I pick up on the desk handset, the Galaxy then continues to ring. I have also had instances when 3CX on the Galaxy has started to ring for a call that had ended earlier. When making a call - it is hit and miss whether I will be heard after someone picks up - WiFi signal is strong so unclear what is happening here. Same when I answer a call (when lock screen is off), I can hear the caller they can't hear me. I have no issue with the web and desktop apps. Disappointed that I cannot achieve full mobility as a result",
      "Using 3cx on all devices. I find the call quality to be a bit horrible most days, regardless of changing microphone gain would be great to have some function during calls to quickly access the quality of the call. and the details of the reports lacks a bit of body. But it's easy to use anywhere.",
      "They removed the Exit ignore push option. I legitimately have to uninstall this app whenever I don't want to use it. The 3cx team seems to imply using the silent feature is the same as the exit feature. This is a blatant lie. Your phone still rings/vibrates and gets the calls going to it. This is an atrocious app if you ever want to use 3cx on a computer and mobile you effectively have to uninstall the ph app whenever you just want to use the computer.",
      "It's okay, but I'm not really a fan of the way it now works with Android 10. If I've received a call on my office desk phone, the 3CX phone app is up and running in the foreground even after the call is finished despite the fact I never used my mobile phone to answer the call."

      "Have to install the phone app because Linux isn't supported any more and seg faults. The phone app asks me to accept the conditions. I click accept and nothing happens. Tried several times with varying degrees of firmness from light tapping to pressure that would turn hydrogen metallic. Threatening my phone with corporal punishment, invoking the spirit of Terry Pratchett, and unplugging the dishwasher didn't help. I'll just shout really loud for my meeting tomorrow, then have some cheesecake.",
      "Constant crashes. Unreliable. Almost completely unable to use. Have re-installed many times but crashes continue. Negatively impacting my job. Very dissatisfied struggling with this dumb app at 4:45am",
      "Works, but I but so frustrating. - there doesn't seem to be a way to turn off the video image if it isn't being transmitted - there are times I just want to listen and put the phone in my pocket. But this app hangs up if the phone is turned off. - lots of hang ups and app crashes when moving in and out of wifi range.",
      "I don't even know where to start... oh wait, one of the main problems with conferencing software is people not muting themselves. Well guess what. The mute button on this app mutes *them*. You can't mute just to listen in. But then, that is assuming you can stay connected. I gave up and uninstalled after the 3rd disconnect in 15 minutes.",
      "I'm trying to connect using Grandstream GCV3200 teleconference, however it always shows \"Vidyo communication error\". I've tried connecting to other android devices, and they've connected successfully. I'm not sure yet if this app needs to be fixed, or I have to contact the device supplier for this."

      "I love this app ! When im out of credit or cant find my phone or have no phone (like now) i can use this app instead. I can text msg friends, call friends just like normal but when my friends joined too we can talk n tex 24/7 for free ! Bye bye phone bill, play a game take a quiz n theres your credit, easy easy !! I love this app !",
      "I was charged 39.99 and didn't keep or use the app for a full month more like less than a week. I was charged and the only way to contact the app is through email that they dont ever respond to. You'll be lucky to get anywhere using this app but you can count they'll charge you even after you've canceled and obviously they don't like refunding your money even though they wrongfully take it",
      "I have installed several apps to get credits, but I have not received them as well as I invited number of friends and they installed TalkU app in thier phones and I have received credits for that. Furthermore, I try to contact the help support through TalkU app and through sending them number of emails, but again no one responded to any",
      "Terrible APP!! I never even used this app 3 days after I downloaded it, they charged my card $39.99. Mind you, I never even put any card information in. They will not give me a refund! I am very angry and if I could give them a negative star review I would! I would highly recommend not using this app, unless you want them to take your money without permission!",
      "I'm changing my review of you guys. I use to buy credits and get free credits from your offers all the time. You was my go to app. For business and staying in touch with my family overseas. NOW,,, I never get my credit's from your offers. Everytime I try to call my family overseas your app goes to people i don't even know. I tried complaining and getting you guy's to fix your problems. I'm done with you. I found a company that takes care of their customers. TextNow people. TalkU is sinking bad"

      "I like this app however we recently had to get this app for work purposes on our personal cell and it uploaded my personal contact. I thought it was going to upload only my work contacts, not happy with that and would like to.get that reverse. How to clear the number of missed calls. I tried clearing them but it's still showing number of missed calls. Other than that I love using it at work. Maybe I'll like using it at home for work too.",
      "I recently got an update to the app, I use an android. I am having an issue where the app will crash every time I try and join my meeting. I have my office calendar synced and everything. I try and join, the app closes out in error. Have not been able to find a solution and it is super frustrating.",
      "Popped up with an incoming call notification for a fraction of a second then instantly said missed call. There was no way to answer. I discovered the Hiya call blocker that came installed on my Note 10+ was set to block private numbers. It must count 8x8 calls as private because I unblocked private numbers in the call blocker app and now 8x8 runs great. Very convenient for doing business away from home.",
      "Performance is generally good but with the recent update my contact list is suddenly filled with all my Google contacts. Virtual Office is for my office contacts only and I can't find settings to turn that off. I turned it off on the app controls of my phone but Virtual Office does not pay attention to that apparently. Update: Things got back on track and are working well. We'll see how it goes as I have ordered a new phone.",
      "UI is pretty good but frequently have issues with call quality. The standard VoIP phone are nice and clear, but the cell app quality is not ideal. I'm often forced to have people call me back on my standard cell number, which of course works fine."

I used this app more than a year now and i can say its the best app i ever found in this term, its free and its hassle feee too. Its worth to download and its very simple to use. Please fix it because i find it very usefull for me. Thanks for this awesome app",
      "Really amazing.. I used it to make continuous call to my girlfriend because she was angry and you know calling over and over is a sign of love. But it's too much annoying to me lol. With this app I could able to call her again and again .. just set number, how much times call to need and it has started to do it's work ... Also this app has an amazing system. It can make calls on loud speaker. So that you can do other work until she take the call. Love this app 😘",
      "It does what it's supposed to. Would of gave it 5 stars but I don't like that you can't go to your home screen or do anything else while using it, because it will stop calling. But when you go back to the app, it picks up where you left off.",
      "There should be an option that the speaker turns on when the call is attended. Another option that when the call is attended it should mute the call. When we set call duration it appears on the screen and then u can't open and work on other apps. Please fix all these three issues.",
      "Very good app, just what i looking for, it do its job, that's it. Working perfect on android 7.0.0 but not working on android 9 stock, the call duration and the hang up settings are missing..."

      "Very useful app. But still there is a security issue. Because, anyone who is an admin of any group, can add any number without their permission. Instead I have a suggestion that, if a group admin needs to add a number to that group, then the owner of that number should receive a message to opt \"YES I am interested to join\" or \" NO I am not interested to join\". This will ensure more individual security. Hope you will update the changes. Thank you.",
      "Not the best instant messaging app but the most popular, which pretty much forces one to use it, and it's decent, especially now that it has a dark mode, save for the fact that we still can't edit messages to fix mistakes, or that we can't select messages and press the text bar to quote them like before, not even as an option. Two things to be added that'd greatly improve the app.",
      "Since the 20/03/2020 update I can no longer open whatsapp. It crashes every time. I can only access it if someone sends me a message and I click on the notification. I have been using this app for years and this is the first major problem I have encountered. I have cleared cache and even reinstalled a number of times without any success. I'm using a huawei P30. Please fix this issue/bug, i use this app every day to keep in contact with friends and family. I have notified support but no help",
      "Before the start of 2020 WhatsApp was the best social App ever created. However, since the start of the year, I'm not sure what changed but it went from a 10 star to a 1 star. Video calls are poor and voice calls are worse. You talk for a few minutes then the person on the other cannot hear you. At 1st I thought it was temporary but this has being going on steady for months.",
      "This app is very useful for me. It keeps my work sorted and I can also stay connected with my loved ones easily. It also helps in my business. A lots of pictures I can share with my clients easily. Easy conversation. Calls quality is good Video call feature is also nice. Overall this is very useful application for anyone and easy to use...."

      "This app is seemingly better than the Jive Mobile app that it's replacing but there are 2 key things that I'm hoping will be updated. If so, I'd give 5 stars. 1. The Name on the Caller ID now shows up when a call is coming in since my initial review (so I'm giving 4 instead of 3 stars). 2. You can't listen to voicemails on the ear speaker, only the loud one. VM Forwarding would be nice also. Thank you development team for responding quickly to feedback.",
      "This app is severely lacking, Specifically what it's lacking is a Create Contact from text message or call log screen, Doesn't show contacts address and obviously you cant click on a link of the address to take you to maps locations. Cant copy and paste any text to even make it a bit simpler to open your Iphone contacts to create a contact. Fix all that and I'll have a good review for it. UPDATE, AWESOME..i knew you guys could do it!!! Great Job fixing these issues",
      "Needed for work. App ringing is unreliable. Contacts imported from phone system (sidecar) cannot be edited and do not get updated when updated in the sidecar list. Does not differentiate between personal and business calls. Can't set special ringtones via the app to help distinguish business/personal. This is much worse than the Jive app we started with, which finally was greatly improved and working well just before we were notified that we had to switch to GoToConnect.",
      "Extremely unstable app. If I am connected to wifi when o get a call, I have to disconnect before answering so the call doesn't drop seconds later. Issues answering 8/10 calls as the app rings while on silent or will ring but doesn't pop up or open so you can answer the call. Its unfortunate, I felt that the Jive app (70% reliable) just had its major kinks worked out before switching to GoToConnect. I have to use the app for work (sales) so I dont have a choice but really disappointed.",
      "My issue was due to another third party app on my phone. Once I disabled the other app, GoToConnect works now. Sorry about that."

My replies and messages are completely in proper working order. update: for the past few updates, I cannot access the games.",
      "Hi! Just a little suggestion, can you please lighten the dark mode, like that of the twitters? Just gray scale and not really dark like black, i like it to be on dark mode however i cant really enjoy it because my eyes are somewhat sensitive to really dark colors. Just a bit of suggestion. Nonetheless, youve got a great app! Makes me connect easier and cheaper with my beloved abroad :) AND I hope you retained the ❤️ reaction instead of this one 😍. I prefer the former hehe",
      "Ive already explore it in various ways just to contain the full features of this app... i can say that it is one of the most reliable Video Calling and Chatting app that user can enjoy anywhere in the world... with just a minimum of data usage.. all of my friends here always ask me how to use the functionality of this app... i can teach them with pride. 😂 😂 😂",
      "Ive been using this app for years, its been always good untill now im struggling with an issue.. Which is I cant actually check any of my messeges requests or spam messeges it doesnt show this icon in this app anymore for my facebook messenger account, please try to work on it & fix it Asap. Im looking forward for this issue to be solved.",
      "At many years this app was good. Almost a monthly update everytime, especially the star wars update. But when I updated my messenger, some of my emojis changed. Ive lost some of them too. In short, my emojis resetted from their older versions. The update was cool but please fix this problem."

I'm giving you 5 stars.... So next year when we re-up on our contract think about giving us a discount.... Lol! Jk jk jk",

      "Very good. But finding difficult how to group many Contacts for a meeting.",
      "Inability to cut off camera and mic before joining a meeting drew some very unwanted attention rejoining in a noisy environment. Ability to stay connected when shifting from WiFi to LTE is very poor leading to the above issue.",
      "Initially, ran into trouble as the purple bar with a # on it was not pressable, and the green checkmark on the keypad did not submit the room code. A call to support (and a bad review here) brought quick response, which is appreciated. After three months of multi-point use: this is a solid high-quality software. Good audio quality, and is given priority. Quick focus switching when someone starts speaking. Facilities for all the usual videoconferencing features. Kudos to developers."

I have yet to get one piece of useable infomation from the app. Nothing that is remotely close to a gps location has resulted from hours of my time in an attempt to access such information.",

Besides the irritating ads that pop up while trying to find a location and knocking you back to earlier point and most frustrating once you find area and click to get address location the message from hell appears \"ERROR\" no matter where you click.

I called customers service they asked me to go on the web .My account was ok on the web , they asked me to uninstall the app and downloaded it again then restart my phone which I did. I have been with Boss revolution for a long time I can't even remember but this app is a pain in my neck every time I have a new phone. Therefore I give it one star",

And this app want to alter my numbers after the call don't go through. I wonder if the other part had the app would the call go through and still be charged even if it's VoIP both ways.",

      "This is a good app, and it definitely has potential! However, I am disappointed with the following; (too many ads) that there is no remove ads with purchase option, when you lock an SMS convo with a passcode by tapping on the unlocked padlock icon - it prompts you to set a password. You have to enter this password everytime to see the conversation. My issue is that there is no \"permanent\" unlock the convo feature after it's been locked. I'll rate 5 stars when the developer fixes these issues.",
      "Its perfect for keeping in contact with my son while hes gone and thats so awesome 5 stars for me. I wish you could add the feature screen share while on facetime so that the both people can watch a movie together while on facetime. That would be so great if they could add that cus I had it for my LG G5 but my Samsung A70 doesnt have this feature and its newer phone so Im confused. Anyways my point is that its amazing and great in everyway. Its awesome for when they are away from Home",
      "Response to message doesnt work. Message sent but still says sending. Contact name doesn't show for some contacts but when pressing the number, the info shows that it actually is a saved contact. No delayed sending option. No pin to top option. Really no options other than customization. Uninstalling. Going back to the stock messaging app.",
      "A super clean, beautiful interface w/ optional themes available at your disposal. Nothing to cluttered or clunky either, as it's all very well optimized. No lag. No annoying plug-ins/extensions or integrated ads planted within the interface. Ultimately a great app with no nonsense from the dev's. Definitely a step up from the native stock app on my S9+. Gripes: Photos are organized by album rather than date. Ads Redundant emoji button. We already have one. Contacts don't update quickly.",
      "I love this app. It does everything that I need it to do. But I have to comment on these stupid huge emojis that keep popping up. They are pissing me off because they keep popping up when Im trying to text and I keep hitting them. Please get rid of them. Other thank that its great I can talk to my kids that are to young for an actual phone.😁 Its the only app I use for video chatting. And sometimes I completely forget that I cant call people on my phone and just use the app instead."

      "I love this! My grandma lives in Canada and doesn't use the internet or have a smartphone, so I wasn't able to easily share pictures with her. This makes it do easy! And she raves about it. It's better than just sending pictures because the captions make the pics more interesting. I've been using this for the past year and can't say enough good things! Just remember to add your pics by the end if the month! Only thing I wish is that I could easily make an exact copy to send to myself.",
      "I love this service. It's a great concept for expats. My parents love it. However, the app doesn't work well. Just like for the other user, I am not able to go past the window to rate the app until I force quit the app and restart it. It's quite frustrating.",
      "Love the app. Doesn't seem to work so well on my new Oppo phone though. I have a subscription but I still get notifications to by a subscription or photos won't be sent - I still get charged though. Also with oppo the photos get rolled over to the next month. I find I need to go onto the website with my laptop to manage it",
      "First of all you're charging me for this and I've never once used it. Second of all I never remember signing up. Third, when I go into the app it makes me rate and won't go past that screen. if it's not fixed and I don't get my photo albums that I've paid for, I'm going to dispute the charges. Is completely useless if you can't even open the app to get your pictures in book",
      "Super nice, it's easy to use and my Grandma is beyond happy when she receives her album! Thank you for making my Grandma feel like she's part of the everyday life of her grandchildren!"

      "Worst app ever! Its created to just get your money one way or the other. You enter your genuine details, you get connected to bots, gals just want to ask you to make calls which is paid and super expensive, which means, you literally waste your time. Its has all the security against nudity and and all in warnings, but its cheating. A better model of business would be, 10 msgs with person of opposite gender and one 5 min ,video call per person. Then paid to call or contact further.",

      "Everyone should visit: ( BrowserGood. Com ) to install the best browser app. It's BLOCK ADS, PRIVACY and FAST. Firefox doesn't work. Works for maybe one or two sessions, then just won't respond to clicking on links, menu items, or even typing in addresses in the address bar. Tried with AND without extensions installed. Clearing storage is the only option to get it to work (temporarily) again",
      "This Android browser is really fast and has an option al tracking protection which was made together with Disconnect. This is one of the things which make it worth using it over chrome. But if you use a privacy friendly search engine on chrome (Qwant, Ecosia, DuckDuckGo) you're already a long way to better privacy 🙉 👍🏼. Also I'm really EXCITED about Mozilla going to implement DNS-over-Https (DoH) which will stop prying eyes from corporate DNS servers. I will be waiting for that feature 🥰.",
      "If you force stop an app, it may cause errors. Yeah basically accessing any site sometimes would have the browser stuck in loading until I force close it. Firefox is an old behemoth, I figure, and it's hard to squash all the bugs, but it's the browser I've stuck with for years. Keep up the good work, but really though, get the loading bug fixed, it's been like this for months.",
      "What Happened??? Firefox used to be awesome. Man it just slowed my phone down and would freeze alot then wouldn't scroll. Appearance is nice until you realize there is no Dark (Night) Mode and no themes. I hope its just in the middle of Construction or something cause I have always been a fan but please get this browser back in the game asap!! Chrome needs some competition but seems to be no contenders.",
      "I get random hangs and freezes on my OnePlus 7T. Sometimes, opening a link from an app will freeze the device for 10 seconds and Firefox fails to even launch. Even with no background apps this can still happen. I'm not really sure what's going on but I'm switching back to chrome for the time being."

I just did it for first time and they received a message saying 'the service is not available in their area'.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP!!!",

      "I almost didn't install this app as a result of a few bad reviews I red earlier. It's really not what they have described it. At last, it's working awesome for me. Calls were all clear. I hope you first of all install and give it a trial before you conclude.",
      "Had to pay to make international calls. Which I was willing to do. Come to find out rather than going to the person's device and calling them directly...they recieve the calls in WhatsApp which we already use. The purpose was to not have the call be as unclear as Facebook and WhatsApp calls. So basically I paid for this app to make a call through-to a different app. Total Scam. Waste of time and money."

I'm not but it's a thing that happens. May be it could that be possible? I don't want to switch to another but I don't know if another has it either. Thank you.",

Also takes forever to open a text çonversation and multimedia is a worthless button that just says sending for weeks. Zero stars is the real scare but enjoy money.",

And ever since i started using it i keep getting warnings that too much memory is being used. Im so bummed bcuz i love to be able to customize to the extreme and this app potentially offers that, and tons of themes to choose from plus you can literally use any font you choose, but too many bugs):",

      "Been using Mighty Text for about three months now and am very happy with every aspect of it. Does exactly what you need it to do without the other party having it installed on their devices. Being able to make, reply or just monitor incoming phone texts while on the computer keyboard is much more convenient and faster for these old fingers than trying to do a long text on the phone keypad. Will be upgrading to Mighty Text Pro in the near future. Very well behaved program that does NOT interfere with the normal operation of other computer programs in anyway. Bob",
      "There is no obvious way to stop the annoying reminder that covers the bottom right of the screen to say I have not checked in. I know that; tell me once, but then stop the constant reminders! No matter how many times I close the reminder, it comes back. There are programs that need that real estate, and the reminder is a problem. It also does not go away when you check into the program.",
      "I have been using this app with windows and linux OS's for a number of years. I just upgraded my phone to a Galaxy S10 and it works well, actually better than with the S6. I like that it also works with my tablet. I recommend it for people who do not like tapping on screens, the amount of data for the free version is a bit limited, otherwise it's great.",
      "I have been using the Mac version for several years and I am very pleased with it. For the last year or so I have also been using iPad (beta) version which I find even more useful — as I always have my iPad with me. The great thing about this app (for me) is that I can read and send SMS from the app — this even works when I leave my phone at home (so long as the phone is connected to the internet). My phone battery is old (like me) so having the ability to receive and send SMS when I am out of the house — when the phone is at home charging is a boon for me.",
      "Boy, I see all the good reviews and wonder. I bought the full version and at least once a week it breaks and I have to either unlink the phone or reinstall the app. It also randomly won't send texts from the computer. I'm moving on very soon"

      "I love this app!! It's not exactly plug'n'play to use...but it's worth it. So pay attention to the instructions and if it doesn't seem to work then persist. The developers have done a great job of streamlining it to make it straightforward step by step but there are definitely things you have to attend to.",
      "Galaxy Note 10, February 24th 2020 Installed, works as expected, except when I manually turn it off, I have to manually turn up my notification sound. If I were designing the app I would not make the user have to go through this extra step. The good news is that if I let it complete the silenced period so that it turns itself back on, it re-enables the notification sound.",
      "A truly used to love and rely on this app. for some reason now everytime I choose a contact to send the text to it randomly chooses a different contact. I would give this app five stars if it would just send the reminder text to the right text. like I said I love this app and relied on it for over a year before. It even looks different on my old phone so I don't know if I just didn't update it and the updates to problem but got any suggestions please help",
      "I'm pretty fond of this app. I bought the extra feature so I can use it for my FB Messenger as well, and it really helps me focus at school because I know if something's urgent people will call, and if not the person knows WHY I'm silent for so long. I do wish that changing the time on an auto reply actually just changed the time, though, rather than making a whole new auto reply. That part is irritating.",
      "This is a good app! I watched a movie and the lead actress is using this app and i kept on wondering what's the name of that app. Luckily i bumped into this. I can easily schedule my reply msgs to be sent at the time when I am busy or doing something. Would definitely recommend this app."

      "Great browser for millennials, as it looks like its intended audience. The swipe to search feature is definitely helpful! There are a couple rendering issues when switching apps and video pages sometimes don't load or disappear upon rendering. It would also be nice to add auto-complete and search for bookmarks on the search bar. A speed dial for bookmarks would also be a well appreciated feature! Other then that it is a fantastic browser in progress!",
      "I really enjoyed the user interface & design of cake, like the ads say, it is a browser designed for phones and the free VPN is a nice touch. However, it is extremely slow. I have just ran a speed test with cake & chrome. Cake came out at 38kbs and chrome 29mbs! It's a shame the speed can't be quicker, because it's an awesome browser! Please fix guys! 🙏",
      "4.1 stars is spot on, I like it! I like how the Cake browser blocks ads, everything would be perfect. Except it has it's kinks. It freezes sometimes whenever I try to open it on multi-window, (Chrome works fine in 1/4 view, 1/2 & 3/4, but no option for add blocking. I know ads help pay for websites, but I'm a Christian male who happens to be human, I'm flawed, I don't like to see certain ads that remind me of said flaws)",
      "The feature to swipe left/right between favorites should be something you can TURN OFF, but you have no control over it. I find it to be obnoxious and useless to accidentally open the same two \"favorites\" again and again and again when I'm working within my 1 frequented favorite, especially since one has had a safety cert expire. I'm uninstalling the app and giving it 2 stars. Fix this problem, please.",
      "This app truely amazing, but it does not preload pages the way it claims it does, thus losing a star. This app does not keep your device on when watching a video, though, and you may need to watch videos elsewhere. The design of Cake is great, and it keeps your identity secure. I have not seen a single add yet, which is incredible, and I find this app great for research. I highly recommend this to you, and hope this was helpful."

      "Used to be my go to app for calls with family and friends. However, after the last update, I cannot connect my Bluetooth headphones to the app any more. I do a lot of commute and connecting to my Bluetooth headphones was always an awesome experience. Not anymore I'm afraid. Everytime I make call the app would switch from Bluetooth to speaker as soon as my call was answered. Please fix this issue! I'm bound to use other apps with mediocre calling experience until this issue is fixed.",
      "Its agood app really really fun and enjoyable I'm pretty sure a couple updates and it would be great I mean you can text ,call,play games!!I love it it's such a good idea for when you are waiting for a friend to come back and you can just play a game or draw while you wait!!!its such a great app it definitely deserves the hype it doesn't get!!!!!🦄❤❤👉👈❤❤🦄",
      "The app is good considering it is free. Its easy to use and the video call quality is not bad. I downloaded the app mainly because my four friends and i wanted to talk while in shut down due to the Corona virus and this app allows to do that. I am content with it.",
      "This is one great app for sharing moments with your loved ones when you cant be there with them . great video quality but cant talk on mic because of major feed back from back ground noise . if this could be elevatied it would be great .",
      "I love this app , but I just checked now and when u log in you need your ID not your phone number and I have two different accounts and one of them doesn't have an ID so how do I get it back?? I'm really upset so plz fix it . I liked it better when you could use your phone numebr"

    "description":"Pingtumi is a mobile broadcast messaging service that enables any business, organization or individual to message large groups using push notifications. \r\n\r\nWHY USE PINGTUMI\r\n\r\nIf you are a business or organization that needs to capture the immediate attention of your customers, Pingtumi is the perfect solution for you. Instead of investing in app development or gathering thousands of mobile numbers to send text messages, you can have your customers subscribe to your notification feed on Pingtumi.\r\n\r\nIf you are a consumer and you are tired of receiving annoying push notifications that miss the mark, subscribe to specific notifications on Pingtumi and only receive the notifications you care about.\r\n\r\nPRIVACY\r\n\r\nWe respect your privacy. To use Pingtumi, you don't have to disclose your personal mobile number.  We believe your mobile number is private and that only you should control who has access to it. When your subscribers create an account on Pingtumi, they can subscribe to your notifications using their account username.\r\n\r\nTITLES\r\n\r\nEach notification you create belongs to a title. We do this to signal intent so your subscribers know in advance what to expect from your notifications. This ensures that they only receive notifications they're interested in. Say goodbye to annoying spam messages or irrelevant notifications cluttering your home screen.\r\n\r\nMULTIMEDIA\r\n\r\nLooking to grab the attention of your subscribers? No need to limit your notifications to written text. With Pingtumi, you can personalize your notifications by adding audio, video maps or images. \r\n\r\nSCHEDULING\r\n\r\nUnlike other messaging services that force you to send your message immediately or save as a draft for future distribution, Pingtumi provides a variety of scheduling options. Send your message immediately or schedule by time or location. To schedule by location, create geofences around venues of interest. Your notification will be automatically triggered when subscribers enter or leave your geofence.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMIZATION\r\n\r\nPingtumi also enables you to tag incoming notifications with custom sounds. If you've subscribed to many notifications, you can create a custom sound for each notification title. When the notification arrives, your custom sound will play so you'll know who it's coming from.\r\n\r\nPINGTUMI FOR BUSINESSES, ORGANIZATIONS AND PUBLIC GROUPS\r\n\r\nMark your notification as public and:\r\n\r\n★ Provide directions to attendees of your event, meetup or conference.\r\n★ Notify your students of important class announcements.\r\n★ Drive return visits to your website and grow your online business.\r\n★ Encourage customers to visit your store when they’re nearby.\r\n★ Alert prospective buyers to your new real estate listing.\r\n★ Schedule private reminders so you don’t forget important events.\r\n\r\nPINGTUMI FOR INDIVIDUALS AND PRIVATE GROUPS\r\n\r\nMark your notification as private and:\r\n\r\n★ Remind friends and relatives of important events.\r\n★Notify your party or wedding guests about changes in the location or time of the event.\r\n★Communicate cancellation of the little league baseball game to parents.\r\n★ Schedule personal reminders such as remembering to take your medication or take out the trash.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit us at:\r\nwww.pingtumi.com\r\n\r\nOr send us a message at:\r\ncontact@pingtumi.com\r\n\r\nOr install Pingtumi and subscribe to our notification feed at:\r\n@pingtumi\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\nTeam Pingtumi",
