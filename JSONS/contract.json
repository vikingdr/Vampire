      "From the recent updates search feature is not working properly. Earlier search would show results that contains the searched keyword in contact. But now until we type complete name in the format it is saved the contact is not being displayed. Please look into this... May be from last 3 months I'm experiencing this problem, mostly an update in this time frame has changed the search feature.",
      "What I am the most disappointed in is that the ability to search contacts is now only restricted to within the contacts app. If used to be that we could start typing contact names in the Google search bar from the home screen, that was by far the most used search feature. This restriction really impedes the fluid use of the contacts app. Unfortunate.",
      "Google contacts is a awesome app, through this app you can save your contacts on your Google account, and the a main thing I observed is if you save a contact on your Google contacts app is automatically save that particular number on the device memory.... This really helps a lot and thank you guys (GOOGLE) for creating such a great and useful app... I really appreciate your work.",
      "Inconsistent. Seldom finds either of my two printers. One printer is connected through Wi-Fi while the other one is connected through hard wire to the same wireless access point. Neither printer is a problem when printing from other devices, but this app routinely tells me the printers are unavailable.",
      "I would say it's a great app. But I have a small query on this app. I have two mail id on my phone. Recently I added one more mail id and deleted after a day. And now, i can still see those contacts which was in deleted mail id. It is very irritating to see those contacts. How do I remove those contacts? It shows contacts from 3 accounts though it is deleted .I would be very grateful if u help me with this google."

    "description":"Law Made Easy! Contract Law is a free new app, the third installment of Law Made Easy!, a series of law-based apps designed with the law student in mind! As many college and university students will find, law can be a stressful subject. But look no further because Law Made Easy! has one aim in mind, and that is to take away the stress of studying law. \r\n\r\nOur law apps are focused on the UK's legal system, which is practiced broadly and forms the basis of the legal system in most Commonwealth Countries.\r\n\r\nThe third installment of this series aims to provide students of law with an accessible and simple understanding of a very basic subject, one which is present in our everyday lives - Contract Law. This app is perfect for those who are taking Cambridge A-Levels or those who are just starting their degree.\r\n\r\nContract law is a subject that is based on a lot of case law. The Contract Law cases contained in the app are indispensable: the collection of cases here are as complete as possible, bearing in mind the importance of each case. Our team took great liberty in choosing the cases, and it is with great regret that some of the cases made the cut while others did not. No doubt the process was done with great care, and only those which are of utmost importance are provided for your convenience.\r\n\r\nImportant statutes are also provided. Contract law does incorporate a fair amount of statutory material, and thus we strive to provide the important legislation.\r\n\r\nThis app comes with an in-app notebook, so students can keep note of any important notes and chapters, and because law is an ever changing entity, it helps to have a notebook to record any recent changes and developments. It is so much easier to keep all your contract law notes in one place, rather than have papers all around. This helps students to revise the subject of contract law wherever they are! Forget the hassle of bringing paper and law books wherever you go! The in-app notebook is so much more convenient!\r\n\r\nThe app is good for revising before exams. With simple easy-to-locate chapters such as offer and acceptance, rights of third parties, misrepresentation, terms and conditions, one simple click gets you the concise information that you want. Contract law is an important subject in both Cambridge A-Levels, and in the first year of a law degree, be it from the University of London, Liverpool, Bristol, or Cardiff, or any other university that offers a law degree.\r\n\r\nBecause Contract Law forms the base for most of our everyday interactions (yes, we encounter it every single day! From buying newspaper, to ordering a set meal at McDonald's, they are all considered a contract!), it is imperative that any law student must understand this subject to its fullest. With this app, everything is in your hands. However, it is first and foremost a supplement to your studies and while it cannot be considered a textbook, the app is many respects a guide for you along your journey as a law student.\r\n\r\nThe features of this app:\r\n- Concise, easy to read format\r\n- A-Z list of important cases pertaining to contract law\r\n- In-app notebook\r\n- Detailed headings for each contract law chapter\r\n- notification function for us to keep you informed on the latest updates\r\n- case updates page: where additional cases are added, this is where they go\r\n\r\nAlthough Law Made Easy! Contract Law is an app designed for university and college students, it is also equally as useful for any legal practitioner wishing to revise his contract law or for those who wish to learn a bit about law.\r\n\r\nDownload the app now! Learn law the easy way today with Law Made Easy! - the only law app you will ever need!",

      "When using it from my phone app, it did not provide a search option. Also, it populated my contacts with duplicates, additional ones for WhatsApp and Skype for example. I am trying to get away from Google as much as possible, but this one did not do it. Received a quick reply from the developer who suggested that I try the pro version, which I did. it is much better. I like it. Now all I want to do is to make sure that I can sync my contacts with other devices and ditch Google contacts.",
      "I have been saving my contacts for some time on this app. I like having my contacts kept personal and free of online exposure. I want to reset my phone so I attempted to export my contacts to a file. The app does not recognize any contacts to export even though I am looking right at them. Very frustrating.",
      "This is a basic dialer that can use contacts stored on your phone. Love that! No more Google. However... GOOGLE HAS PREVENTED then from offering regents and call history!

As of 03-20-2020, this is not truly a dialer app, at least for my Blu G9 running android 9, updated to the latest version.",
      "Having paid to upgrade and put up with the more frequent glitches, I'm now unable to access my account at all. Edit: Now seems to be resolved. I'm dubious about using as I can't afford to miss important calls, but I'll give it another try. Edit 2: Almost all photos now disappeared. Edit 3: Some photos restored, apparently at random, but some numbers (from Google contacts) now truncated. Bizarre. Edit 4: Now seemingly resolved all issues. I'll use guardedly.",
      "Is the app also available in other languages besides English? Now I set google account language in English to let match the labels within contacts etc. with app. But native language is another than English. And please, try the accessibility scanner of Google for finding accessibility issues: not all buttons and icons are labeled with text-based labels.",
      "New to this app. The app seems to be user friendly and includes a lot of features. The only thing I've issues about is that unknown numbers can be saved only to 'new contacts' , the option to save to the 'existing contacts' doesn't appears at all.",
      "One Big Glitch The app works great except that it cannot handle group texts. You think you're replying to the group and the app sends the response to one random person. I'm going to stop using it. Hopefully they fix the glitch."

Plus this IS rated M and you have to pay for the \"romance\" scenes. Some people are into that, so whatever. Otherwise, it's just the guy talking-kiss-MC stuttering and blushing-fade to black.",

      "So far this app has not disappointed me at all. It has everything that you are looking for. 5 Stars for sure! Won't be disappointed. The only issue I am having is my calls are saying they are being recorded but when I go to listen to them it's dead air, silent. The recording time length is they're just no sound. It could be me, IDK. Not enough to give it anything less than 5 stars. Thanks Drupe. If you have any ideas on my recording issue, please let me know.",
      "It could be a great app only if you weren't trying so hard to reinvent everything. The design is to much, childish even. So many features no one uses, with such a design, makes me rather use a different, straightforward dialer. Try at least to make another, lite and minimalistic version of the app and see the reaction. My bets are it will be more popular. Who, for example, needs a calculator in a dialer, really. Because of these problems I only use it for caller identification.",
      "I like the features and functionality that I get through this app. However, there is one feature which I absolutely don't want as it troubles me almost all the time. When we get or place a call then we get a hold/un-hold button on the top left of the screen. So when we are on the call that button invariably gets pressed through the ear/skin and the call goes on hold in the middle of the conversation. Very troublesome button location. Kindly fix it to get better review.",
      "Records calls but when you play the recordings, you cannot hear the other person. You are loud on the recording of the call and the other person is not even a whisper with a volume booster app and volume at the max. They can not be used as any kind of management in customer satisfaction or as evidence since you can't hear the other person. Useless! Have not found an audio editor that can edit my records from drupe. They can edit ones from other sources of call recording but not these. 100% waste",
      "When in initial set up, the 5th and final screen presents the dots, then moves them to the right of the screen. The problem is that it moves the dots so far too the right of my screen, that they leave the screen entirely leaving me with nothing visible top swipe to the left. I can't use the app without passing this screen. -Can I bypass set up, and just go directly into using the app?"

    "description":"A mobile App for negotiating and creating multilingual contracts for buying and selling goods. \r\n\r\nDeveloped by practicing lawyers in the U.S. and China who represent companies in global trade.\r\n\r\nIdeal for companies or individuals who value fair and easy to understand contracts and are involved in buying or selling goods, especially across borders. \r\n\r\nGone are the days of long contract templates with one-sided, confusing and unnecessary language.

      "This is a good dialer. I have 3 stars because it seems to me that the developers are not thinking about the least number of presses to get the job done. Rather the app has a lot of nice features that are harder than needed to access. Additionally it would be nice to have the company name listed under the name. I sent an email to the developers but heard nothing so I'm posting my review.",
      "Ive been using the app for two weeks now and its been great, it's solid and predictable. The one thing i wish it would do is group together reprated calls from the same contact. By the end of the day i have multiple instances of the same caller. It clutters the call log and fills it unnessasarily, that's the only thing ive found that could be different. Otherwise well done!!",
      "This app is a phone number app, with caller ID and spam blocker. It does so many useful things. It can still use more work like be able to separate similar names. Example my Daughter's middle name is my middle name. No way to separate and if you merge. A big problem arises. Especially if you make it a direct dial number. Other than that It is a good to.",
      "Functions well with a few extra features compared to the Default Google dialer but I was looking for an app that will launch the dialer by default but you don't have that in your options. Please add the option. Puzzling how this is disabled on new Android updates, why add an extra step in order to make a call?",
      "I've only been on it 8 hours and so far this app has brought me a lot of relief and a lot of useful features. I might update and adjust the score later, when I've had it in use longer. I haven't yet figured out how to use the cleaning functions so that I can skim through the entries that the software wants to delete, and remove the keepers from that list. So, so far cleaning functions are the only feature that I'm reserving judgment on."

      "BEST app I have found to help build my business, I feel like it looks the most professional and makes my company look the same!! Love the different options to send a quote to my clients via email or text, and get a notification when they open the quote!! The options it gives them to pay an invoice with a credit card! AND also the options for the client to finance a project I'm going to do for them !!! Over all if you run your own business Contractor, handyman etc. this app will definitely help!",
      "The app is pretty good considering price point for pro version. The big issue is you can only contact via email or online chat thru app when available, which is hardly ever. This is a huge problem when you're having technical issues such as emails not being sent to clients. It's a bigger problem when you're waiting for credit card funds collected by Joist but haven't been deposited into your bank account. I've had these issues for a while and no help from Joist. Going with another company.",
      "The app has helped me quite a bit in my business, the only thing I am not too thrilled about is that they are adding more features based off what they find a contractor needs and should have access to as a basic forms, like a change order for example. I asked about that a long time ago so they knew they needed one. I hope they don't keep increasing the price and becoming too expensive.",
      "I'd like to have the licences number displayed, but to bunch it in with other useless features disappointing. Don't care about social media links. Insurance papers can be presented to customers as requested. If I'm at the point to send an Estimate, they usually know we are insured. I was with you guys from the beginning, but I'm going to have to cancel and try a new app. Don't like the direction you are going. Sorry",
      "I've been using this app for years now and it's been great. They have now taken away from it so much. Now I have non stop problems with this app. If you need myjoist help cause you can use this app good luck on having anyone to return your email. I have sent 4 emails asking for help to resolution on the problems I'm having. It's now been 5 days with no reply and they dont have a number to call for help at all. I'm not looking for a new app. I used to tell everyone about how great this app was."

    "title":"Service Contract Workers",
    "description":"Union employees have advantages over their non-union counterparts under the SCA. For example, if employees negotiate higher wages and benefits in a union contract, the contractor can be reimbursed by the federal government. The government only reimburses contractors the minimum amounts set in area wage determinations UNLESS there is a union contract requiring higher pay. This means there is an incentive for your employer to give you a raise if you have a union; there is much less incentive for them to give you a raise if you have no union because the contractor, not the government, has to pay for it.\r\n\r\nMany employees working for government contractors constantly worry about what will happen when a new company gets the contract.

It takes 100% cpu on minimum 2 up to 8 cores(out of 8), the graphics (cards moving) stutters and the phone warms a lot. 3. Pressing back after a game is finished is not intuitive. A simple big button \"replay\" or \"home\" would be ok.",
      "game is nice. But lots of bugs. it crashes a lot missing important features. U cant see the score during playing. how can u update your flag? the high scores are not goid enough. there are a lot of cases tgat a player is disconnected and then the other players get stuck waiting. very frustrating. another annoying thing is that plsyers always leave when they lose their chances, and then you get stuck playing against the computer.",

This isn’t just racing, it’s contract racing!\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CHALLENGES\r\n\r\nUnlike other racing games, Contract Racer has multiple types of challenges to complete. You’re a contractor with contracts to fulfill, and that means your driving talents will be needed in a variety of situations. Drive a taxi, a sedan, an ambulance, and more—whatever the situation calls for.\r\n\r\nSometimes you’ll be in a fast-paced race against the clock, fighting to reach your goal before time expires. Other times the police will be hot on your heels, and you’ll need to escape. Still other times, you’ll find yourself in a competitive race against other cars. No matter what your objective is, you must rise to the challenge.\r\n\r\n16 EXCITING COURSES\r\n\r\nRace through 16 different courses, each with its own goals and requirements, and unlock the next course with each one you complete. Your contracts will take you from the desert to snowy fields and beyond. Can you complete all 16 races?\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CAMERAS\r\n\r\nView your car from behind in third-person view or watch the action up close with first-person view. Whichever camera you prefer for driving games is up to you, and you can switch easily between the two perspectives during any race.\r\n\r\nONLINE LEADERBOARDS\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve mastered a course, check out the Contract Racer leaderboards to see you how your racing skills compare with the best of the best.

      "I have to say I've tried both this and the adobe sign app. Why isnt this all just one app? I really dont get it. I feel like you guys are so close to perfecting the digital signature but you make it unnecessarily complicated. Why cant I create a template with this app and then create new contracts based off of it? We cant be expected to create every field/form every time. This should all be one app. You need to hire someone to combine these apps simply/easily with a mobile only mentality.",
      "While it's a very useful app, it lacks a lot of features you would expect from an Adobe PDF software. For example it lacks support for pre-filled form data and highlighting. There's also some PDF that it can't open. Another important problem is that it doesn't properly persist filed-in information when switching apps, so if your phone is short on memory while you check something else, you might come back to a blank form.",
      "The app is easy to use but constantly gets in the way of itself. Needs more features and better zooming. It needs landscape mode. It needs more toggles. This app is just forcing you to use the main app that they have and spend money on it l. With that being said, this app does what it's supposed to.",
      "I wish I'd known about this app before! Very functional and great for filling out forms from font size control, signature feature to being able to fill out check boxes. You have control and it looks neat. I will be using this often, and can now not worry about having to pay and/or travel to print forms only to take a pic and/or scan them back to digital to send them.",
      "LOST ALL DATA! 30 min for filling a form, copy and paste is not possible and in general not easy to use! I switched screen a few time to find info on other apps, but the last time I came back to the app the form disappeared from the list and I can't find it anywhere! What a disappointment from Adobe."

      "Very good although slightly laggy. The puzzles and mini-games are interesting and the graphics different from most games, hand drawn beautifully. I'm not keen on the directional arrows, there might be a way of turning them off but I haven't found it. Update: I've changed my review to 5 stars because I'm really enjoying it despite the odd glitches! The ouiji board didn't work, spelled the name loads of times but nothing happened, had to skip. Great game-play all the same :-).",
      "Don't get me wrong this is a fun game, even without a bonus game. There are just alot of glitches. For instance even though you solve a mini game don't count on it being solved. The color puzzle for one. Believe me there were no 2 colors touching but nothing happen. I even looked up a walk through, did it exactly as the walk through and NOTHING! Instructions weren't to great on mini games, that's why I lookex up the walk through to begin with. In your menu when I hit more games, erorr every ⏰!",
      "Enjoying the story, the graphics are decent, puzzles are easy to solve. At least I have been getting through them on my own. Wish there was an enlarge feature, and I would like real voices occasionally.",
      "This sucks. Im right in the beginning (just installed) have the bucket, at the well to get water to kill the fire so i can get the mirror, right. It won't allow me to use the bucket. Keeps telling me i need a bucket. Really, it's right there. You suck. Uninstalled.",
      "The controls are awful and need to be precise in puzzles. There is no map, hop were small and hard to make things out even with zoom, puzzles didn't have very good instructions ie ouiji board where after every letter u have to tap yes for it to accept, I still haven't finished it but most of the puzzles are ones I actually hate. I am so fed up going backwards/forwards I'm not even trying anymore, I skip puzzles after a few mins for it to all end so I can play something else."

Lots of polish on contact edit, but the only setting is sort by. Where us dark mode? Why are there 2 headers saying \"Contacts\"? Why can't I dial? Why can't I click on a letter to jump in an index? I like it but it simply can't replace Google contacts and that is the baseline.",

I'm tempted to delete this app and look elsewhere ... !!!!!",

      "I like the game so far... but do something about passes developer",
      "I feel like in some of these reviews, people take this app too seriously. The premise is already ridiculous and the characters totally unrealistic. I'm not sure what you're expecting. Some of the guys are kind, like Andrea. He's my favorite. Clearly the game is for fantasy purposes. Like fanfic. However, the English translation is awful at times. It isn't unreadable but it is...awkward for some stories. And sadly, the romance is lacking because you have to pay for everything.",
      "Love love LOVE the stories! Theres so many different characters to choose from and they each have they're own personalities and stories. I am addicted. Use my invite code to get free stuff! ( yfHydQ )It really helps both of us!",
      "I couldn't finish the first run-thru of this game. The character of Prince Claude belongs in jail, or a crime story, not a romance. He obviously faked the Main Character's trouble at the border in order to trick the Main Character into thinking he had done something for her and that she owed him, when in fact this was a bald-faced lie to get her to help him out. He constantly insults her, and has threatened multiple times AND HAS STARTED TO rape her! And no option to react appropriately!",
      "The stories and graphics are nice. It may seem like a pay-to-play game to some people, but you can earn platinum for free by installing games. Unfortunately, the developers have stopped adding events which were an important part of the game to me and many others. Events used to be a good source of avatars, tickets, etc. but they are no longer available. It seems like the developers are trying to rack up on cash without putting in the effort anymore. For this reason, I'm giving the game 3 stars."
