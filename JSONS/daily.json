      "I love the variety of stories, but DM has ruined their site with too many pop-up ads. *Edit* February 2020 if I could give zero stars, I would. Their ads have gotten worse, if that's possible. Trying to view pictures that come with the articles is impossible. I didn't mind too much when I could exit them immediately, but now it won't let you back out of ads. I'm deleting this app.",
      "This app was probably one of the best newspaper on line. It has now got to be the worst. Persistently crashing. DM appear to not want the user to read it's stories with the the addition of a NEWZIT ad to take you to your browser for 'live' stories, which take forever to download. Why does it have to appear on every story?. It is akin to a zit on your face, unwelcome!",
      "Used to love this app, but everytime I swipe past a picture an ad pops up and you can't even close them right away. I think in gonna remove it from my phone soon. Can you imagine reading a book and everytime you turn the page an ad pops up. This app is like that but worse. I gave it two stars because I still like the content so much so that I was willing to pay for an ad free version but that's not even an option.",
      "Gives additional news that I don't see from others, for which I give five stars. One recent change to the Android Daily Mail app seems to be using more battery(take 2 stars away for that). Another recent change is showing links to other stories in the middle of articles, which you have to scroll past, to read entire article, I do not like this change.",
      "It used to be passable as a news app, despite the typos and grammatical mistakes from their so-called journalists, but now it's been ruined by intrusive pop-up ads, and a massive panel in the middle of every article advertising a service called \"OldPustule\" or something."

      "The app I personally have come to love. Positive little affirmations & mantras are a keystone for myself personally in life. The reminders can be set multiple times throughout the day with various categories. It's the excellent support one may need on a daily basis. I highly recommend it & going premium is not financially taxing.",
      "It's a really awesome app I'm using the free version many amazing quotes the only thing preventing me from rating 5 stars and buying the full version is I like to use the widget and the widget goes blank like a few times a day and I have to open the app and it comes that if you would fix that it would be perfect",
      "I love this app. It helps me relieve stress and smile and the good things in life. I love the quotes that are on there. Eventhough im not on premium the are fantastic quotes still on there.",
      "I feel like this app locks (until paid for) the most important topics that quotes would help with. To even chose a topic of quotes you have to watch an add or pay. I think it does give good quotes for free but I wouldn't ask for money for sharing feelings through quotes"

Whenever i click on the 'tap to share' option at the bottom of the devotional, the app crashes. I have uninstalled and installed multiple times in an attempt to 'reboot' the app but am still facing this problem. Help please.",
      "Lately, over the past week, the app has not been working properly. It no longer shows the quote at the end of the devotional reading. Please fix this problem, I love reading Our Daily Bread. It is an excellent and necessary source for my own personal Bible study.",
      "I believe this is the best daily devotional ever. And this is what I use for my personal Bible study. The only hitch is that sometimes it stops working and I have to uninstall/install. And of late it's not downloading the sharable image. A bit frustrating.",
      "What is going on...??? I've been reading the ODB for over 15yrs, initially receiving via mail and/ or at church. But in the past 3 or 4yrs on my cell. The app has been locking up, stalling to the extent I cant read and GOD forbid cant even listen to it!!! Now I cant send my grand children the pic with the bible verse on it, which they looked forward to every morning...it was my way of having them read the WORD and get there young attention with the added pictures.Recently it hasnt been available",
      "I love the app. It is app that can help you to devote your time with God. However I have problem: I would like to share devotional images with others, but it keeps disappearing. Yah. That's all. God bless."

      "I've been looking for a simple, yet creative looking diary for a while and Daily Life is the only one that actually feels like writing in a diary! Love the mood option, adding pictures and music is a great option. The interface is easy to use and it can be navigated easily! Would highly recommend if anybody is looking for that perfect journal app! Would like to see more mood options though!",
      "Can you please fix the PDF extraction feature? When extracting to PDF, the photos get cut off and part of the photo is included in another page. It would be good if a photo is fit in one page and not cut in half (cut off faces for example is not really ideal). Overall the app is really good, just need to get the PDF extraction feature fixed to make it perfect.",
      "My fav diary/journal app 😍 I've installed a lots of journal apps and this one is my favorite! It has most of my required features when it comes to journals/diary, but I hope we could add stickers or stamps on our entries for more cuteness. Anyway, it's still awesome and I love it. Looking forward for future updates~",
      "Luv it. One thing, I think would be good if you'd show a simple overview of how it works. Such as once you make an entery how to get back into that same date to add to it. Or anything else that the public my not be aware of.",
      "This is my first time buying a premium. I buy it because of the pdf extract features. But as written in other review as well, the picture will get cut off and part of the picture is included in another pages. Please fix this and I will definitely appreciate about it!"

I tried several times but it didn't worked. Even when I had internet connection. So does this AAP work or just takes the storage. So, what should I do now?",
      "I always loved this app, at first I was using Dailymotion on my web browser but decided to download the app which I like the layout of, the only thing I wish there was, is a thing to continue watching what you were watching instead of having to search for it again or the next episode of what I was watching kind of like the web page but I really like it",
      "I like the app, but more the site. I don't know if it's an error or my phone, but the videos don't have sound. I tried to change my volume, checked the sound settings, but nothing worked. I give it 1 stars because of the sound, but because I think that it's my phone and not the app, and the content it's good I give it 3 stars. If it is my phone the problem, please excuse me! Thanks!",
      "Really good app. You can download and save videos which is really good. The reason why I gave 4, not 5 is because the way you fast forward or rewind the videos in that you swipe your finger left and right. If you were to change it to something like a line at the bottom of the screen with a dog of where the video is at, similar to YouTube it will make it much easier for me and I'm sure others. But all in all, great app",
      "Downloaded app to find a specific video but couldn't find it. Now I get notifications on all sorts of videos that I'm not interested in...waste of phone memory. According to the link the video was added over 2 years ago. When I click the link I am taken to dailymotion but with a big black screen that (roughly) says for enhanced veiwing experience watch on app. I never answered questions as to what my viewing preferences was because I was never asked..."

      "Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is.",
      "I'm very sorry I bought the full version so quickly. The only benefit I found so far, is the ability to add more than 7 habits. I couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that I seem to regularly miss. I was drawn to the simple UI but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to Daily Tasks.",
      "I was reluctant at first to use this app but now absolutely love it. It's simple yet effective to track your habits and keep on top of to-do list. Truly one of the best app I have used (& I seldom say or write any comments). However, just one niggly point would be the alarm where it doesn't seem to do anything even if I choose to have alarm on the Reminder function. If this could be resolved, it would be awesome and would just go premium!",
      "Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the \".00\" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.",
      "I got this app to track my medication and it's perfect! I can set up how I want to take each medicine (yes/no or quantity), see the start date and adherence in the summary view, and even track side effects and effectiveness each day then see them in a chronological list in the sunmary. And the best part is that it's not tied to some medical database! Added bonus: I can track real to-dos as well. Overall, love this app!"

You can vote in polls, and read articles about your sign, while being able to comment with other people. Giving it a 4 star only because I think it has more potential. The side features like the magic 8 ball and palm reading could be replaced with things like more in depth profile customization, and lengthier articles.",

What you did... now I have to click 6 times! Are you kidding? After latest update backup on google drive works again, but I have to click seven (7) times to make a backup. If I had not payed for it I would uninstall. You just lost two stars !",
      "please please please let it have voice notes 🥺 that'd be so useful and really nice. been using this app since christmas 2017 :) UPDATE: greed really is .. about to end this app. adding multiple photos shouldn't be something you pay for. i tried watching ads but it kept crashing every time i watched it. reconsidering if i should keep on using this app.",
      "This is a useful, clean app, very good as a daily journal or for other text-based record keeping. It is simple to use, allowing efficient daily entry of notes. The search function and presentation of previous dates' entries makes it easy to review contents.",
      "It w.a.s a perfect app before it got slower. As I use this app, it is getting slower and slower when I type. I can't get the reason. I wish the developer tell me the reason why it is getting slower and fix it ASAP.",
      "The app worked great for some time and then suddenly it stopped saving the notes. It never worked by closing the app out with a normal exit but if I would force close it would save the data. Now it doesn't work at all. It is simply a calendar to look at which I already have. If you did an update then you failed."

      "I like the app but it's missing some key features. I love the category, activity and mood systems, but I need more out of the notes. Need to be able to upload images, sometimes this is key for me. I do free writing exercises (hand-written) and would like to add those as entries in their original form. Not gonna type it out. Might switch to a different app for that feature. Would prefer to stick with this one but only if I can add images.",
      "This app is wonderful. If you want to analyze yourself with a million different spreadsheets and graphics, this is the perfect app! Its seamless, fully customizable, and glitch free! I've been using it daily for over a year and I have not encountered a single issue with this app. It deserves all of the stars!! There are adds, but they are so well integrated into the app that they don't disrupt the experience.",
      "I love it. Never before have I kept track of my emotions this thoroughly. It has helped me to reflect more and stay in touch with what is going on with me. Being mindful, even if I don't do specific mindfulness exercises. Great app, that got me so hooked that I just had to get the premium features, which make it even more enjoyable. It really is worth every cent. Definitely looking forward to future updates!",
      "I have, as of today, made it to a 500-day streak of journal entries, no matter how minimal some are, or how long others are. thanks to this app. I've been trying for YEARS to keep a daily journal of some sort-- I tell people in RL about it ALL THE TIME!!! Try it!!! Also, I was really happy to discover, upon getting a new phone recently, that moving all my entries to my new phone was as easy and perfect as... pressing \"restore.\" I've got everything backed up in google drive, and it just worked!",
      "Wonderful app! Tried several mood trackers, but this one is my favourites. Great visualizations, lots of cute icons for setting custom activities, ability to set custom moods to track, etc. There's also a habit tracker that's well integrated with the mood tracker instead of being completely separate. Strikes the perfect balance between easy to use/customize and functionality. Clear interface that's got an elegant minimalism without being severe."

      "It was all going well with this app until the flashy ads at the bottom of the Bible started to affect my ability to read and understand the words of God clearly. The x at the bottom to get rid of the ad doesn't work. It just starts to slide over the menu. The only way to get rid of the ads is to pay for them to be removed. I shouldn't have to pay to read the words of God clearly. I will be looking for another Bible app.",
      "I like how easy it is to use. Having a daily psalm, gospel and verse of the day are wonderful. Having a morning and evening devotional is great. Being able to highlight in 4 different colors, underline, or bookmark a passage and being able to search through each individual thing that is highlighted, underlined or bookmarked is amazing. I like the fact you can set an alarm for the daily verses so it reminds you to read them. Unfortunately my alarm on mine doesn't always go off, thus the 4 stars.",
      "I love that it has audio reading!! Perfect for when my day gets too busy and I am unable to sit long enough to read. Do laundry, cook, clean, wash dishes or even shower and get your daily Bible reading in. What a blessing 🕊 I am thanking God for this app as we speak!",
      "This app is very easy to use. I love the options to highlight and daily devotionals. I also love the plans mapped out to read the Bible cover to cover will be using one soon. The audio reading option is awesome as well for when my migraines are to bad or I have to much to do to sit and read.",
      "I haven't tried it yet time reviewing everything that's on my phone so if anyone within the app from this day forward can give me the reason RF is beneficial life it's worth it to download it then I will God doesn't charge to watch ads. A little I can see but a lot of these apps really they are getting ridiculous with the ads and they want too much information why you are giving a permission to go into your personal information. God bless good night"

      "The only thing I didn't like is that all of the body toning sessions and most of the others are only for the pro users and I wanted something free since I'm just a student. But otherwise for the few free sessions I really like the app it's easy to follow and I really love that there are options to choose what you want to work on: beginners, weight loss, body toning etc.",
      "Things I don't like: Can't listen to my yoga Playlist along side this app. No heart points get rewarded. The free version is littered with ads. A yoga version of candy crush. Things I do like: Incredibly thorough. Easy to understand. Even though I've been doing yoga for years, I learned different nuances of poses in just one session. Yoga for ALL levels of abilities.",
      "I am new to yoga so I decided to try this app furst before joining a class. First week and the workouts are really great. You can pick whichever type of class you want. Beginners to Advanced. Also has a lot of meditation that work great for relaxing. I paid for the year so its a little pricey but they gave me 60% off. Not so bad. I think its worth the $$$ as long as you use. Its a personal yoga session in your home... Namaste : )",
      "Excellent app. Guided yoga routines and meditation. I'm really impressed as I thought it would be difficult to do but they are guided. Slightly annoying that the majority of courses you have to pay for, but there you go. Fun stretches and relaxing meditation sounds. Thanks",
      "This should keep me on track. I've been into yoga in the past but have slowly strayed away from practice. In one short session, my forward fold improved and I was able to severely release undo tension in my lower back, my calves and my shoulders. Definitely need to work on opening my chest and shoulders. Looking forward to tomorrow's session!"

      "Overall, it has been a gentle and positive \"voice\" with me; it is a supportive and encouraging presence. The steps are slowly layered allowing time to build good and healthy habits. I can add them when feeling confident to take the next step knowing that this next step, or habit, isn't going to be overwhelming to achieve.",
      "So I'm a premium subscriber, the idea of the app is great, but the app is quite buggy. For example: - backup and restoring on another device doesn't works (backup not found, but same account?) - syncing between devices should be a given (to have a DnD device without usual email, WhatsApp disturbances before the day starts, evening), doesn't exist - ofen returning from floating head, screen is just white (until you press back often enough to jump out of the routine) - you can't end challenges",
      "I like the steady pace and the small steps. They help to accomplish tasks during the day that I could otherwise forget. This app is good for people who find themselves wasting time and are clueless of where to start. The only con I can see is that this isn't for type A, energetic or lively people. IMO",
      "Useless app, charged during trial, won't refund. I got charged on the day 1 of 14 day FREE trial. The app consists of long reads in a condescending tone that repeat you name every other sentence. It is a cheap trick from sales, but how much is much? I promise you, Reader, they will pose your name, Reader, everywhere, Reader. The customer support is useless, they have even a process for refunds - but safe your time, any option will lead you to \"we are sorry, it's your fault, bye\".",
      "DO NOT download this app. Do not sign up for a free trial. Don't even look into it. I signed up for a free trial and was immediately charged for a full year. I contacted them for a refund and they said Google Play takes care of that. I contacted Google Play and they said they have nothing to do with refunds as the money went to this app. If I could take stars away from this app I would. Update: As you have continued to ignore my request I have claimed your charge as fraud."

      "Very nice app to provide a scripture verse every day. The verse can be expanded to display the entire chapter to see the proper context. The hamburger menu on the lower left provides additional resources such as an exegesis of the passage and a short prayer based on it. Many other features in the settings are available for customizing font, language etc. It's part of my daily routine every morning.",
      "In addition to the daily verse, I like that it's easy to read more of that chapter. I also like the new prayer that goes along with the daily verse now! The daily devotion is a great addition too! I have not read the devotion as often yet, but it doesn't seem to coordinate with the daily verse. That is okay, it's still nice that it's offered now! Thank you!",
      "Love this app! Just what I needed... Quick verse can open to the book it's from and there is a daily prayer and devotion each day to go with that verse. It also has many options in settings such as a daily reminder time and text size, etc.",

      "This app is amazing! It does exactly what it claims to. The only slightly downfall is there are ads, but they are not for games and stuff, but rather neat things! But when there are ads, the little \"x\" is big enough to hit and it dosnt send you to the app store every time! I do have a suggestion though. Maybe put in some tips for tablet users? Most of the device related ones are for phones or computers. Thank you! Keep up the great work!",
      "My biggest concern is that about 30% of the (tech) hacks are out of date and don't work (there's no way to flag them afaik), another 10% are pure speculation with no proof, 5% are old wives tales that don't work (tried them years ago). There are a lot I was unaware of that are pretty cool. But more than not, I was a little unimpressed. Excellent effort, clean interface, category choices, easy nav... the app is really great otherwise. Update the info and easy 5 stars.",
      "Alot of fun to find out new things especially when they are so simple. But however people like pictures as well. So my suggestion would be to Life Hacks is to spruce it up some with some colorful pictures of some kind. This will keep the interest going even further as to what else is there to know??? Attention spand is MANDATORY in educating yourself.",
      "Absolutely, it is an amazing app. Beneficial, offline , no irritating adds (depends)and it's completely free! Give it a try and install this app you won't regret. Tips that this app recommends you will be helpful in different fields that we are getting involved with them in our daily life and although help's you to keep your mood and self confidence okay 👍. Personally, I do appreciate the developers effort for making this wonderful app. Looking forward for new updates and new tips!",
      "Listen I've always enjoyed what I've seen things you people so just finding the app I'm going to install it now.. always seemed to find interesting useful things from these folks. I remember one of the finest quotes I ever saw was I think a former head of the patent office way back in the 1800s said everything that is important has been created already,. Anything that helps me go opposite that kind of thinking that's the way I lean but of course \"trust but verify.\""

It does have a good selection of verses with music and nice backgrounds if this is what you are looking for in an app.",

      "My only complaint is that the background pictures often blend with the words of the verse. Forcing me to \"guess\" the word blending into the picture. Not a user friendly feature. I despise flashing ads. I don't mind ads and certainly would not pay to remove them. However, I will never look at or purchase any product with a flashing ad. A stagnate ad I would consider buying product. I cover the flashing ads with my fingers. Very annoying ! Love the daily verses.",

Other apps the next message can be accessed directly from the notification.",

I can't find any feature in the app that provides information about how to proceed in this kind of situation, and that makes it extremely frustrating to attempt to use it. Overall, I consider this app to be great, but I do think that some kind of 'Help Center' should be added in order to make it easier to use.",

I barely met anyone normal, otherwise the app is fun but I dislike the fact y0u have to watch an ad to post a picture, otherwise, this app is great but some people ruin the experience.",

    "title":"List:Daily Checklist",
    "description":"Welcome Goal Achiever!\r\n\r\nThis Apps' mission is to encourage, support, and reward you for taking meaningful daily action towards the attainment of your goals, big or small. To help you take consistent action long after the excitement you felt when you committed to a worthy goal has faded.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons you might not be successful at reaching a goal is because you did not take consistent and sustained action for a long enough period of time.\r\n\r\nThis checklist was especially created to help you take daily consistent action over time.\r\n\r\n\"For changes to be of any true value, they've got to be lasting and consistent.\" - Tony Robbins\r\n\r\n\"...we have to make good decisions, use discipline and be consistent for long enough to see the results we desire.\" - Darren Hardy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple:\r\n1. Enter the actions you know you have to take daily to reach a goal. Like: Workout for 40 minutes, make 10 cold calls to prospective customers, send out 10 resumes to potential employers, write at least 10 pages for project, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Put the widget on your home screen. When an action is not yet completed it shows up in bright colored text. Once you check an action off the list the text becomes a lighter color.\r\n\r\n3. Your daily mission now becomes to see the list go from bright (in the morning) to gray (before going to bed). You can instantly see how far down your action list you are at a glance. This color change also signals that you had a successful day. A day in which you accomplished all the actions you needed to take you one day closer to your ultimate goals.\r\n\r\nA successful day, with all items checked, results in a green check mark placed on the calendar. Watching a series of check marks fill up the calendar, helps motivate you to stay consistent. \r\n\r\nThere is an indicator on the main list screen that shows the number of consecutive successful days. This is your success streak. A streak with seven or more days turns this indicator green. This gives additional motivation for consistency.\r\n\r\nThe home screen widget also serves as a constant reminder of the actions you need to take today. Each time you use your Android device you'll see the list and the amount of actions remaining.\r\n\r\nIn short: Don't go to bed if your list is not completed. If bedtime is near and your list is not close to completion, get to work on what is left on the list!\r\n\r\nNote: This version has a limit of 4 goals and an unlimited number of actions.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments send an email to:\r\nchecklist.help@gmail.com\r\n\r\nIdeas for Uses:\r\n- Goal achievement\r\n- Motivation\r\n- Build and re-enforce good habits\r\n- Behavior modification\r\n- Build discipline\r\n- Daily to do list\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Simple visual design to remind you of your success actions\r\n- Number of unchecked high priority items displayed at top of on screen widget\r\n- Priority indicator to designate importance of items\r\n- Priority significance chooser. Allows you to specify which priority level items need to be checked to gain a daily check mark\r\n- A variety of text and background color choices\r\n- Change text size of list and widget\r\n- Alert on individual list items\r\n- Automatic daily list reset at a time you specify. You dictate when your day ends\r\n- Cloud Sync your List to other Android devices\r\n\r\nPermissions:\r\n- Contacts: Find accounts on the device – Needed to connect to Google Firebase for Cloud Sync\r\n- Storage: Modify/Delete SD card contents - Backup and restore database to SD card",

I need to take medicine once a day and do a series of stretches a few times a day for a medical condition. This app helps me keep track of what i have and haven't done. It would also be useful to have an option to make a task that should be completed once every X days. Like go on a walk (etc) every 3 days.",
      "This is just what I needed. A little difficult to learn where to find certain features (select days, task sort, etc), but now I see it has them. I may get paid version so I can sync to desktop making it easier to adjust tasks and goals. Thank you, developers. Suggest add ability to make goal with no end date.",
      "It seems ok, but the UI is confusing. How do you mark that you've achieved a goal for the day? I've switched to a different app.",

      "A great journal that is user friendly & free. I checked out several apps but this one was the best one for me. You do not lose content even without having to save it. Been using it for over a month & no complaints whatsoever. Plus no advertisements to interrupt or distract you. It even sends you a reminder if you haven't written in your journal today. Thanks Daybook!",
      "It's great. Easy to use, has a dark mode and the reminders have helped me stay up to date with my journal entries",
      "I wanted a simple, adless journal with no frills. This app delivered. There probably are some nice features for those who want them, but if you just want to be able start tracking your daily thoughts with no distractions, then paying for this app is a great choice. Oh, and there's a dark theme. Any app with a dark theme is a winner in my book.",
      "I've only used it to record one day's events and I'm feeling refreshed already. I've never tried writing things down when I'm annoyed or sad and so far it appears to have worked. Not a fan of actually writing myself but this is a perfect compromise between letting it out and not writing with a physical pen.",
      "Just found your app and it seems to be exactly what I needed! Plus thank you so much for not bombarding your app with ads. One feature I'd love to have: I like tracking the progress I make with projects, so it'd be cool if I could see which story is related to which project. For example, adding a tag to a story and finding all the tag-related stories by search"

I play many times and there is a ads always you to play it and I know they can make money if that and us did not its bad.. Is not good.. Maybe there is controller of that... 8",
      "Many months ago i won a total of $86 but sad to say cannot withdraw it because its been a long time since i have not win again... Until now i always use this app..they said before they will lower the payout from $100 to $50 but until now it did not happen",
      "The app is okay. Some says its just a waste of time but for me a few click on ur phone to get a chance to win if this is legit is not a waste of time..its fun though i have few regrets how and where they get their money to give to their lucky winners..maybe there's a technical program here by way of watching their ads..maybe.. just sayin.",
      "I've just found out about the app so I don't have much to say about it. Just confused as to where I'd put the referral code of the one that recommended it? Anyway, it's simple and seemingly is just straight to the point and seems to be based on chance, unlike other games/apps. Hoping to win!"

      "Super powerful saving concept, but packed up in a simple user experience. Used to use something similar on Apple and finally found one on Android. Feature suggestion: a savings goal function which allocates a portion of your daily budget until it's met.",
      "It's so simple. Set up how much discretionary spending you can afford each month, and this gives you a total for each day. Surpluses accrue, deficits accrue, and it always gives you something to work towards. Spend less and the number goes higher!",
      "Absolutely has everything you need, except calculates the wrong numbers.... Put in the income and it shows it as 200+ more on the monthly total and expenses were also more than the actual total amount. It's hard to make corrections if the data it's telling you is off.",
      "I've been using this app for a long time. I love the way that you can manipulate the budget as things change and bills go up or down. My only concern is that I have to go back and forth between the income and expenses. I wish there was a way to see the whole picture on one screen. I also used the app on my other tablet when I was recently carrying two mortgages.. One budget showed the reality of what was and the other of what could be. Now I only have one mortgage and fewer bills.",
      "The app is excellent. The only thing it laks (and would make me pay for it, I suposse) is the ability to have more than one account. I had to find another app that does the same that this one does just to make it posible (and its not easy. Aparently, Android users are good at finance and not a disaster like me to need an app like this)"

And that you need a radical change to see a radical improvement in your life? Goalist offers you a path that's undeniably different.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't merely remind you to do stuff - that's simple and ineffective. It's too easy to just postpone a reminder. You end up with a bunch of annoying to-dos...\r\n\r\nGoalist helps you determine what to do and why and then provides flexible tools to plan and realize the plan. It helps you transform into a highly effective Time Management Master.\r\n\r\nUnsuccessful people use lack of time as a good excuse. Successful people have the exact same amount of time as anyone. They just manage it well. And as a goal achiever you know you cannot manage it if you don't measure it and plan in advance. Goalist allows you to create very detailed daily plans.

      "Have been using goalist more than 2 years with paid subscription. Awesome App. Had high hopes. Could have been great. But looks like it has been abandoned. Forum link not working. Cannot report bugs. No updates from past 6 months. There has been no progress in development on any modules. Want to but won't renew subscription in good conscience. Looked at subscription history, have paid around 3100 bucks, no accountability from developers, they just put the development on hold without announcement",
      "I've only been using it one day, but it's exactly the app I need to manage my time better. I suggest following their advice and tutorials for getting started: start by logging what you do throughout the day.",
      "This app is amazing. I am a longtime paid user with ADHD and I adore all of the functionality. Thanks for everything you do, you have literally changed my life in many ways.",
      "App have potential, but \"awaiting for development\" shouldn't be used as an add-up to the functionality list if they aren't being implemented yet. Paying up for functionality that isn't working is almost fraud. Sorry, but it's true. Be confident in your development an people may follow the growth of your app or simply promote it as it is and surprise with every updated functionality. Keep it up! 👍",
      "Nice, but OVERCOMPLICATED! Not for the average user. It feels very personalised, like it is someone's life or brain that they have laid out in an app. The idea is definitely there, but it needs some simplification. I really want to use it, but trying to get my head around setting a goal, then adding a task, which category or value it goes in?? By the end of it feel more confused than hopeful I'm so sorry to say. Just some constructive feedback for the designers, and nothing personal."

      "Inspirational & encouraging. Nice layout with the option to read along and journal. Also has a place to check if you've already listened. My only question is why is there 2 android versions for same app? The layout on this is more organized. I paid a small fee for other version and this one didn't charge. Maybe that's because I am paid and this is established when I signed in? One difference is u can download to listen offline on other app but layout is better on this one.",
      "Update 1/2/20: I contacted tech at DAB & they worked with me to fix the issues. Thank you! The app works well and the upgrades are great!!!! The upgrade is HORRIBLE! It constantly crashes on my Android and doesn't recognize my password or email that works perfectly on my desktop. It skips and fades out during playback and doesn't remember my place after crashing so I always have to restart. I hope you can correct these bugs because I like the new features and LOVE DAB",
      "This is the greatest ever.( 2020 My second year) To sit and daily follow along, the word being read to you. No need to try to pronounce the many biblical words and names, Brian does it for you. No need to get different versions of the bible, it's all right there. Click listen, click read and each day fill you heart and mind with the word of God from the bible. Even a brief review and commentary and prayer each day. I LOVE IT AND THANK GOD IT.",
      "I love the app when it works. I have a lot of trouble keeping it connected and it does not sync with my progress on the web page. I really want it to work because it is the best way to access the devotion each day.",
      "This is what I have needed for so long. A consistent daily feeding of God's word has never been easier. And it's fresh every day with prayer and encouragement afterwards."

      "Great app! I've been using it to track my daily drawings instead of photos, and it works just as well for that purpose. I wish it supported more file types (e.g. png) but I don't mind, still does exactly what I wanted! Thank you!!",
      "It does something I really need, so thank you. Please expand my ability to add a photo from the past to a date in the past. This could be by enabling me to share from inside Google Photos, then select a date. Or, it'd work if I could select an album from which to upload a photo inside Daily Photos; I'd just put the pictures I need to add there, first. Thank you!",
      "GIVES YOU VISION! I use this app everyday now to take 2 photos of each side of my face and track the progress of my acne healing. I was inspired and hoped to find an app to make a timelapse video, but I came across something better- this app. You can store multiple photos on one square of the calendar. I can really see a daily difference, now I'll never have to wonder if what I'm doing is working again.",
      "I love this app! I'm able to see my photos in a daily calendar which is exactly what I wanted. The only thing that I can see improving this for me is being able to take up the entire day on the calendar with my photo so there is no white space, but honestly I think it's fabulous as is :)",
      "Great app would love the chance to create a printed story book at the end of the year"

      "This is one of those apps that make you thankful we have the technology that we (humans) do; and the interface is good, easy, app has been stable. I paid for gold - if this is in your interest, I highly suggest trying it out at least! There's free version and one below gold as well, so no reason you can't try it out if you like art!",
      "I usually never rate with 5 stars, but the rating needs to get at least at 4.5. It's a great app to improve your skills and take some wonderful ideas. I find the community great, the developers better and the challenges nearly perfect. It works just fine on my phone and the fact that it does not contain a subscription, but rather a one-time small payment (optional of course) seems really kind of the developers and moving to me. An app purely based on the community, and I love it ♡.",
      "Really kind and supportive community! Even if you're just beginning and making heaps of mistakes, we've all been there, and I've never seen any rude behaviour in the app. Prompts are interesting and varied, and you can see all different kinds of art people have uploaded, from detailed oil paintings to simple abstract sketches to colourful digital pieces. I am not a paying member and there are no annoying ads, but if you upgrade you have the option to direct message other creators and more.",
      "I'm loving this app so far, it's great daily practise + inspiration for when you don't know what to draw. I like that there are tutorials for different mediums and skill levels. I think it would be really cool if there was a way to tag your art besides the medium used so you can look at specific things. Alongside a tagging system, blacklisting would also be nice. Then people could have more freedom with what they draw while others can blacklist their triggers.",
      "Great way to do some art everyday. So much more motivating than just setting the goal to draw daily because there are real artists putting up talented stuff. Makes you want to get back into doing your best and becoming better, even if you're just using the app in a light-hearted way. Love the daily prompts and that you can look ahead and prepare. I'm not an arty person but there's no ads so it's cool there are ways to support the devs by purchasing art supplies or paying for features."

      "Have been using this every day for the last month, to provide me with inspiration for a daily drawing practice. I tried a couple of other apps before this, but this one best suited my purpose. I really like it - the choice of paintings is broad (in time period, subject matter, medium, and tradition), and getting broader. So far, then, I have no complaints. And I'm probably going to upgrade to the paid version soon. 15/03/20 I have indeed upgraded to the paid version, and it's worth every penny.",
      "Use most days. And look at every day's offering. Seems to me to be a good way to get a feeling and understanding of art. A good mix of well known art / artists and the less famous (at least to me as a novice). I intend to continue using as I feel the app content providers are doing a very good job.",
      "Good, but there are a lot of paintings/ photos that are duplicates (some of these versions are even filtered). Also there aren't a lot of women artists as well as international artists from other countries like South East Asia or Africa, etc. Edit: I see that there are now more women artists being featured. Thank you, Daily Art!",
      "Beautiful Art (Mostly), awesome app. Thank you so much to the people who run this app who have been teaching me about art. I have always liked art and learning about the pieces I really like. This app has introduced me to so much of the art world I might ordinarily pass by. I love getting my daily dose, most days I enjoy the piece, some days I detest what I am being shown, however, those days I make sure I read about the piece and more often than not, I gain a new perspective of the piece.",
      "Look forward to new art experiences. I often Google the gallery/museums and the artist after to learn more. At 70 I can't afford to drive and park and admission to shows in Toronto. But when I was working, they were always priorities when I travelled. Chicago, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, new York, London, India, Peru, Thailand etc. Art enriches. Thank you."
