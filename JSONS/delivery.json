      "Be careful of the ads for restaurants that are not entirely relevant to your search screwing up your results. Other than this, the app works really well. I've been able to explore bunch of different places that I wouldn't have normally been able to go to. It has become something of a Friday night treat.",
      "It was working very well for some time. However, for the last couple of weeks it keeps on freezing when I try to order. I usually can't even get my order out. It is this app specifically that is causing the issues. Another issue is that on multiple occasions the app tells me I have a coupon for a restaurant or free delivery, but then when I make my order it tells me the coupon doesn't work or is expired. Why advertise the coupon on the app to me if it is already expired? It makes no sense.",
      "Several options don't match what the menus say. There are items that say they include a drink, but you have to choose a drink and be charged extra for it. Several options have only one selection that is required even if you would like to omit it. Someone should review menus thoroughly before releasing them. AI may be a good fit if you don't plan on paying anyone to do it.",
      "The app is generally okay, but it's very buggy with the campus ordering option. There are times my order fails to go through entirely because the app throws an error saying that \"this restaurant doesn't accept this payment method\" even though it's the OneCard option for a campus dining hall. Moreover, nearly every time I place an order, there are issues with the order timing out on submission so I have to place the order again. For reference, I'm using the most current version of the app.",
      "Good exceptional, it's good service but, can be a bit pricey after tip, service fee, taxes, etc. I'm a little lazy at times so paying the extra money is worth it. Over all, I like the experience, the app is very simple and easy to use, and I like simple. Grubhub is a great idea when you don't feel like going out and getting food at high quality places, just have someone else get it and deliver it for you. I like this app a lot."

      "It is a great app, but there is one thing holding me away from it. I uninstalled it by accident, and because of that, I could not get back into the app because MY phone number is taken, i wish you had the ability to log into your pre-existing account. That flaw is why this is 2 stars, I would also not reccomend if your are on a budget (minimum amount to spend). I used it and it went well, but those two flaws are why I am not a big fan . way to lose something I kinda need in a day.",
      "Maybe it's just me, but everything on this app seems extremely overpriced. I think the price kind of takes the convenience out of everything. I mean $6 for 12 slices of cheese is a little ridiculous. I would really only use this app if you are absolutely desperate, otherwise you should try finding a grocery store nearby.",
      "Lots of options. When I'm feeling lazy and like making it a movie day/night...this is my go-to app for ALL of the snacks. For later night deliveries, they call your phone instead of knocking or ringing the doorbell (which I absolutely love as I'm not the only person living in the house). Friendly delivery drivers. I just wish I could see a map of where the delivery driver is located, but they do send a text as they are getting close.",
      "It was amazing the FIRST time. The problem now is that it has a minimum purchase you need to reach or you can't order at all. I think this is the last time I will use GoPuff unless they fix this issue.",
      "At first I downloaded this app and it was pretty cool! Was a bit disappointed with their ice cream selection, but whatever. Soon after installing, however, I updated. The app since then has not loaded, even with changing internet connection, more updates, attempting force stops, and unistalling/reinstalling. Hopefully this issue is fixed, because if it's happening to anyone else, that means there's a lot of people who can't even access the service."

Therefore it's really hard to add a new address unless it happens to be the exact same as the My Location option.",
      "The app is fine. The service is terrible. Don't use. If you have an issue you have to submit a help ticket and then if it isn't resolved to your satisfaction you can't contact them again. There is no call in number or anything. Postmates doesn't have a problem taking their customer's money and then not caring about rectifying issues with your order. Don't use them!",
      "Working good until I've just seen a random charge. On top of taking forever to clear on your bank, it'll show up 3 days later on your acct. Ordered for 3 days ago ($22.92), just posted. But I'm looking at it and I see it's a whole other charge of almost $20. ($19.93 to be exact) That's weird because looking at all my orders, there's no such charge or fee! Cancelled being a customer. Refund me asap! Unprofessional!",
      "As a side hustle, Postmates is great. The navigation needs work! It connects to your phone navigation app but only within a block of the delivery address. If you use Postmates' navigation, the arrow pointing your direction is inaccurate. It also, only works if you know the streets you are driving. I have been manually entering the delivery address into my navigation app, works better this way, unless it's an Apt complex, good luck finding the right building.",
      "Useful for getting food delivered straight to your door, but the delivery time is often really long. I've also had multiple times where the food was luke warm and not too appetizing. I've reached out multiple times about updating the menus on the different restaurants because they're mostly out of date and still have items you can order that are no longer available and do not list new items. I'm hoping they will resolve these issues soon, it's a really convenient app!"

      "Update. Nice job! You fixed your app. Works much better now. (Previous review) Fix your app! App works great until checkout. I click \"place order\" and receive an error message saying my card was declined. I called AMEX and they said my card is working fine. They never even saw a request for a charge come through. Something is wrong in your system. After many tries, sometime it works. Really not good.",
      "App developer should be ashamed at how poorly the UI controls are placed. Buttons over text entry, buttons not visible when the keyboard is up. Choosing Pickup when you don't want to allow location access makes the app STUCK and you have to kill it and reopen it. Back button doesn't work. These bugs have been a problem for at least a year now.",
      "For some reason, I had to retry my card over and over and over again, for it to not take it. I kept going back to see if I made any errors, and I did not. So I then attached my card to my Google pay and tried and tried. After consist trying and changing food decisions, I went back to my original food want, and tried again. Almost a hour passes and the card FINALLY goes through. But I already been waiting for about 15 minutes and I have no sign of a delivery driver. I hope I don't lose my money.",
      "Multiple people in my household have used DoorDash and each person uses a different device. The app will keep saying it has timed out which results in the receipt having multiple copies of the same item. Then the same thing happens when someone tries to remove the duplicates. This causes the app to feel like it is more burdensome than rewarding when trying to quickly order food.",
      "They need to fix the app. Every time I order it keeps loading & loading til it says error, try again. When it finally goes through it shows multiple orders that I never added to my cart. Even when I try to delete the extra orders, it tells me error, try again. Please fix the app. I'm rating it to a 3 for now. Til it's fix, then I'll rate it back to a 5 stars."

      "I've used this app for a long time and I enjoy the convenience. One complaint is that for many restaurants, a lot of their menu/ordering options are missing from the app. I'm not talking about dessert items, just regular food options, so sometimes I use other delivery methods. Another complaint is all the fees; I don't agree with a \"small order\" fee when I still have to pay a full delivery fee on that order. So that turns me off from ordering sometimes.",
      "Doesn't deliver in Torres Vedras, Portugal. Requires account creation, phone number, e-mail address, first name, last name, credit card number, and full address before telling you so. Spams you with unsolicited e-mails. No contact form. No website support. No email support. No app support. Uninstalled. Edit (18/03/2020): Now allegedly delivers in Torres Vedras. Reinstalled, logged in, entered my address in Torres Vedras, they still refuse to deliver. Re-uninstalled.",
      "The tracking feature is laggy and not accurate. When looking to seeing where my driver is it, it will show them in one location and freeze them there till I have to close the app and re-open it. My last order placed I ended up having to wait almost 2 hours to recieve my food (which was an item and a half), by then it was cold, soggy and thrown all over the place inside the container. Sent in a help ticket and got a poorly excused \"sorry\" for a response with a measly $5 credit on the app.",
      "Unable to control payment methods in options due to poor app interface. Edit:I am on a galaxy s10+ and the camera/notification bar blocks the 3 dot setting button for the payment option. I need to delete it because it conflicts with my new payment option and I cant add the new one. The second part makes sense but I dont remember seeing that info. It would be nice to know that then. It would also be helpful to exclude it from the list as I thought it was a bug so I tried again. Thank you.",
      "My experience on this app has been in more cases beenn pleasant rather than an issue. The app is always a 10/10 with how they treat customers. My problem with the app is with the food and the handling of it at times; which I'd rate a 7/10. All in all it's a good app that everyone should in their back."

      "Almost perfect. The only issue I encountered was with changing my name. The problem was that whenever I tried to change my name I would save and everything seemed to work, but when I backed out to the dashboard and went to check my name, it didn't change anything. My phone runs off of Andriod Pie (9) Hope this is fixed soon. Otherwise, the app is a great way to shop for groceries and potentially make money.",
      "No doubt this app is conceptually wonderful, but definitely has some hiccups. For one, it's great when it works at all. Sometimes I'm greeted with just a blank page that never resolves despite closing the app/waiting forever/etc. Also, the search algorithm is sometimes very wonky. At least a few times per shop, I can't find by searching what I want, but am offered it as a replacement item when it is running low!",
      "The app certainly works, and I love this service!! There are some quirks that could be improved IMHO. 1. Rating your shoppers on orders from multiple stores is confusing. I could only rate one shopper, and I don't know if it only applied to them or the others as well. 2. Search is usually fine, but can be hit or miss.",
      "Because it adds things to your cart. Have to be very careful. I've been on hold to instacart for 1.5 hours and still holding. Not impressed with the search function while searching for items. Seems it doesn't lists all the items that the store has for example I know that Costco carried frozen french fries but you can't find it using this app. Very disappointed",
      "Easy to use! Very convenient:) Since my last review I have had a couple of issues. Items delivered that rotten or items not purchased. The Customer Support has been quick and they refunded me. Just annoying that I had to go to the store the same day to get the missing and rotten items. Kind of defeats the purpose of this service."

      "I loved this appt, used it frequently. Always got my rewards and my order correct. Unfortunately, I have not been able to open the appt without it freezing upon opening. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall... reason I have changed my review from 5 stars to a 1 star is due to my acct being deleted + needing to register again and starting over with rewards.",
      "App completely freezes up every time I open it, I have uninstalled and installed app more than anyone should ever have to do with a malfunctioning app. Also, updated each and every time a new update was released. It's pretty freakin sad on their part, as I was using the app a couple times a week because I'm disabled and can't just go to the store whenever I'd like",
      "As a first time user it was pretty convenient. I only got myself a pack a smokes but who hasnt been in a situation where they needed something of the such and wasnt able to leave for A-Z many reasons... Really came in for the rescue! The driver Kirk R. was really curtious as well. Will be ordering again...",
      "It's a convenient app to be sure but it lags a lot and sometimes exits out erasing your cart. Tracking system could be a bit more precise as well. But it is organized and when it works it works well.",
      "I use to really enjoy the app but the options aren't updated so that the options they actually have available in store are available in the app as well and over time there's just less and less items available"

Not only that, but its stinking ridiculous that you dont allow payment methods other than credits, or credit/debit cards. Not only am I uninstalling, but I realized you are part of HEB delivery. I will be ending my relationship with HEB delivery as well. I refuse to do business with a company that makes paying difficult.",

And what's more activating is I know I'm using the right email because I'm getting them Favor, just never the one I need for my password.",
      "This app is horrible. The first time I used it, my food arrived cold and melted. The second time my food never even arrived. The app said it was here. Even the runner text me and told me my order was here. But when I looked outside, nothing was there. Then I put in a report and they tell me that they will contact me between 2-4 business days. I do not recommend this app for anybody.",
      "Love it. They put accurate descriptions on 99% of things. I also love the write in an item option, as well as the drivers communicate with me! My favorite over DoorDash and Uber eats and others by far!!",
      "Great! Only wish the hours were longer, that's the only reason it gets -1 star. Since im a bar tender i get out super late and dont have the energy to cook or go grab food so having extended hours would really make it for me! But overall super user friendly and easy to operate!"

      "Always a great experience! Both drivers I have had, professional, kind and quick. My last driver, W-tabius, was awesome! He had no issue getting in the gate and was in a timely manner.",
      "It was working fine earlier but the app is not letting me search restaurants or view profile it just gives me a blank white screen! Please fix",
      "Of all delivery apps I've used, bitesquad is the best. It's perfectly streamlined and the menus most closely resemble the actual restaurant. Other apps include a lot of jumbled unorganized riff Raff that doesn't match the actual menu. Fees easy to understand. Premium service is simple free delivery across the board. The only negative I would say is \"biteclub\". It gives discount codes for ordering a lot. It's hard to find and not included in the app. Instead, its a sporadic email chain?weird.",
      "Bite squad is so convenient when you don't want to cook, but want a healthier option delivered. It has also saved me on days i have migraines and can't get up to make coffee. The taxes and fees do add up, but all in all it has been extremely worth having the membership. It also is really nice to just have the food handed to youand you don't have to mess around with signing receipts. Also, the drivers are always so nice! Order an hour ahead and you will never be disappointed.",
      "For the most part this app is awesome! But occasionally I'll get a certain estimated time and my food will arrive 20-30 min late which sometimes makes me late to my plans. Other than that, I'm so thankful for this app!. . . Ok, I'm gunna take away a star everytime this app asks me rate them. I rated this app already. Stop asking lol."

      "Good local options available but app interface is not as intuitive as it needs to be. App should default to current location but I have had food delivered to past addresses. Customers - be careful and cognizant to check and verify before finalizing orders. I learned the hard way. Waitr customer service was good about correcting the situation but it seems as this is something that should be addressed with the interface.",
      "Awesome , great way of getting what you need if you're limited on going places or just being lazy at home . Very impressed with the timely service and response to staying in touch .",
      "So, this app does get the job done however this app is missing so many features and it little frustating. This app is not transparent enough. Example, I supposedly received a refund and I have no idea if that is true or not because no where does it tell me that a refund was issued. They sent me a notification, but as soon as I clicked it, it disappeared. When the food is supposedly on the way, and I click on the notification it just disappears. I can't even contact the driver myself.",
      "The app is simple when it comes to delivery apps. There's no information on where the driver is GPS wise or a number to contact. I've also had people who sat in their car on their phone for a long time while I was waiting for my food. Without a GPS function, the drivers can take as long as they want. The support function makes it a hassle because that takes time to input information and finally get answers about something I could have called the driver for. Needs to be customer friendly.",
      "Latest app version is less intuitive than previous incarnation, but still usable."

      "Love The Service. Hate The App. Please don't just delete items from my list when they go out of stock. I add to my list all week. Then suddenly, I notice the bill is $40 lower. Now I have to remember/figure out what was deleted. Instead, why not flag the item on the list and not allow checkout to proceed? Also, the search results are horrendous. Feels like search is returning what they want me to buy, not what I'm actually looking for. Plus wrong/out of date images. Luckily shoppers are great!",
      "Outstanding update. Its still early, but so far Ive noticed a much faster, more stable build, and the new color scheme and design dont hurt either. A very welcome user experience upgrade. Thanks for not being lazy, and making sure this app gets better and better. Update: One unfortunate thing Ive noticed in the last several updates, and still a problem in this one, is that Favorites dont seem to update. I cant delete old ones or add new items. The list appears to change, but doesnt really.",
      "I'm still getting used to shopping by app. Once I thought something was in my cart but I must have just looked at it, not added it so I double check cart now at end. Update: I can't say enough about the shoppers and the billing process. Both exceed my expectations. When I called Customer Service they were just as kind and helpful. 2nd Update: Dec 2019 It's been a year and I still like Shipt. Consistently professional & kind staff. 3rd Update: March 2020 Shipt has the best Shoppers!",
      "We love using Shipt and the app is easy to use. 3* rating currently only because finding an item can sometimes be hard even when you have purchased it in the past from the same store. Not everything shows up in the Buy It Again page. You may have to favorite everything just in case it disappears the next time you want to buy it. This could be easily fixed if you could add items when reviewing prior orders.",
      "This app has truly been a lifesaver for me. Since I am now unable walk, I was worried about how I could get food. The shoppers are very quick (often, they are done picking my order in less time than it would take me to find a parking spot and get to the door), they have always been accurate and friendly. I simply can not say enough about this app. Thank you so much. You really are saving lives with this."

So when you let me use the app without rating it or constant annoyances to do so, I will happily delete this 1 star rating.",
      "Search is hopelessly broken. I searched for a restaurant right around the corner and it doesn't appear in the results even though seamless does take orders for it. This is like the \"Yelp\" of food deliveries giving some restaurants preferential treatment over others. It's fine to have promoted restaurants but don't hide them in the search!!!",

I have tried all troubleshooting steps and was notified a tech support request raised, no further updates. Order was delayed by 1 1/2 hour and the support representative couldn't speak to any of the drivers (2 drivers visited) or restaurant. They then decided the best option was cancel my order and refund my payment as credit. Outrageous, offered an insulting £5 credit in return.",
      "Decent user experience but all the additional fees are getting a bit ridiculous. £5 to get a delivery from somewhere a 15min walk away, a new service fee etc. Also so many delivery mistakes have happened, you get credit (forgotten items etc) but then the credit only lasts a short period. Was great, now average.",
      "The app didn't save my new details after I saved them, i placed an order and it came up with my old address automatically. I reached out to support and got nothing but a copy paste reply saying they won't change the Address or refund me and they'll \"try harder in the future\". I replied and they just stopped responding. Absolutely awful, just use Uber Eats.",
      "Great service, but there are things I'm not happy about... I live in London and I'm already paying £11 monthly for the premium membership to have free deliveries (it would be £4 per delivery without it), but they recently added a £0.50 service fee anyway on each order even with a subscription... I'm about to cancel my subscription and start using a different service"

      "Works reliably, menu options are easy to use, and quantities, options, and special requests are available everywhere you'd need them. I entered my entire order without being logged in to my account (acct is not a requirement btw), but even after having to bounce out to reset my password in a browser, I was still able to successfully carry on and finish the order. Seems as if not all apps handle that as well.",
      "I thought the app was very easy to use! It was actually a very fortunate find at the last minute towards the end of the night let's just say it's 8:15 p.m. and they have over 10 options of restaurants to choose from which is pretty cool for it to be an app that you just now starting out I'm assuming it hasn't been out for over a few years now. I look forward to seeing the progress that it's going to make and I like that it gives you the option of being able to use cash!!! Highly recommended!",
      "This is a really good app to have when you want to order food. The app is easy to use and will show nearby food places that delivers or take out. I would recommend this app.",
      "Easy to use ordering from a moderate variety of nearby restaurants. Food always arrives hot and in a very timely manner. (Often earlier than I expected.) I use Beyond Menu more frequently than any of the other restaurant delivery apps. Even my 93 year old mother who is an absolute luddite is able to use Beyond Menu despite her having senile dementia and no experience at all with cell phones. I highly recommend this app for all of the above reasons and a few more!",
      "Very easy to use but it seems that there are hardly any restaurants on this app, at least in my area. I downloaded it because my favorite sushi restaurant uses it, but I only see 8 other in Chinese restaurants on here but nothing else. This can't possibly be the only type of cuisine this app services? Wish there were more pictures or information on the items but it's easy to order and make comments for specific details."

I have wondered about what I would characterize as delays between ordering and confirmation of my order, but I suspect that has more to do with the restaurant than the app. I appreciate the ability to leave notes for the driver or the restaurant. Would recommend!",
      "I have nothing bad to say about the app itself, seems to work well, for the most part easy to use...the live chat is a bit of a joke. (3 stars) Eatstreet itself, Ive used the service 3 times, all three experiences were poor; food arrived almost an hour from delivery time everytime.. the food was cold... everytime.. when i contacted support they were patronizing and unhelpful. Offered me a $7 credit for my inedible $30 order. I would not recommend this service.",
      "It finally remembers my address! Its not very simple to search for things and often the restaurant info is inaccurate. But its the only delivery app that has restaurants in my area. I use it because I have to, not because I want to. But its ok.",
      "The app is great you can monitor the delivery process. You can watch your driver on the map while you are anticipating your delivery. But there is a downside that sometimes occurs. There are times where the app will shut itself down while ordering and you are not able to continue.",
      "Great experience ordering from a local favorite. Their prices are wonderful, for where I order, and the app is the only way you can enter coupon codes, making it a must have! Menus are clear and easy to navigate. The text I received, after placing my order, confirmed all the details. It was a fun, little message but I won't ruin the surprise. 😉"

      "I was told the calling feature would use the store's phone number as a mask. It actually uses a number that traces to an area roughly forty minutes north of us and is flagged by many mobile providers as a \"likely scam.\" I suppose that only matters when it successfully connects, though. Can't comment on GPS functionality as I do not need it. The push notifications are a bit excessive and \"order dispatched\" sticks around even after I'm off the clock. Tips don't enter on busy nights.",
      "Honestly horrible application. What design language were you going for? It's so slow, buggy, deliveries don'toad onto my app all the time, map shortcut that's built in takes you to a block number not the actual address (sometimes being upward of 3 miles off the actually delivery) this makes delivering 10x more difficult. In turn, I don't use it. Fix it for your employees and make sure the app in a position to be deployed reliably. It's actually terrible. Location permissions don't work right.",
      "I should be able to choose \"track only when using app\". Closed the app normal & Android reported this app checked my location 12 hours later off duty. Would suggest running this on an old phone tethered to your phone hotspot. If customer calls back & changes address app will show correct new address but send old address to gps app. That is a strange & unwelcome flaw to watch out for.",
      "This app has so many bugs that neep to be fixed. One driver in the store has this on the phone and the app calls 911 all by it self. Today I had the app call a random number and I wasnt even touching my phone, on top of this 90% of the time I cant even add the tips thought the app because it does not show all of my deliveries even if I force close the app and restart it.",
      "I've used uber postmates and door dash and this app is just a poor excuse as a competitor it literally cant copy an address from an order to maps. The call portion doesnt work at all and now I get in trouble for not using a worthless piece of trash. I'm tired of this app. It was a waste of money for the company and a waste of storage on my phone"

Also, there's no option to omit substitutions altogether. You can only approve the substitution or select a product which always seems to be more expensive.",

I tried 4 times and each it said my card was declined because it would only apply the delivery address to the billing address. I was finally able to get it to work by putting in a fake order for my billing address, then putting in my card info and then had to go back and change the delivery address back before confirming the order. Inconvenient that I had to trick the app to get it to work.",

      "Rarely get a ping to get a drop off. App took an entire 24 hours to accept my driver's license. In app camera didn't work to capture my license. Support (as many others have stated) is a joke. I reached out multiple times to get help only to get an email that someone answered my question, however, I can't access the dashboard to see their responses!!! The app also won't allow you to change your pic. The mugshot it captures of you for \"ID\" purposes becomes your profile pic that customers see 🤬",
      "Generally pretty straight-forward to use, and great for making some quick bucks. Recently I've been experiencing some very inconvenient problems with location and tracking, forcing me to restart my phone and wait for the app to respond after a few minutes so I can complete a delivery. This needs to be addressed. Please, Postmates. I am aware that this is an issue with other drivers. I've done many, many deliveries for Postmates, and the last couple updates on the app really fudged it up.",
      "🙄🙄🙄 I've been stuck on \"photo verification \" step 1 for DAYSS now!! But, if I do anything through email and the actual website it worked (like background check ect) but I CAN'T do ANYTHING as far as trying to make money because of this app! Not to mention I continue to get emails saying to connect my PM debit card WHICH I DID the DAY it came in the mail. So I retried and STILL get emails to do so. GET IT TOGETHER GUYS. I wanted to love this. Instead Im still broke",
      "it's a great way to supplement your income. everybody is always happy to see you ( if you're on time) very rewarding. However. There are many glitches inside the code. You never get to speak to a human if you encounter problems.( very stressful) every time they upgrade the algorithm it puts more pressure on postmates drivers.",
      "It's great when it works which is about half the timealways seems to be an issue I have to uninstall it or you got to check every day for updates and Google updates seems like there's always something wrong anyd got to tweak it for you get requests I've had a few good runs but mostly trying to figure out how to get it to work"

      "Very good App.. I usually use this app to order medicines. Even if the medicine is not listed in the app, they have an option to write the medicine name, the delivery person goes to the store, sends the pictures of the medicine and the price. At that time, you have to pay the amount and the item will delivered. And the delivery fee is also very less. Apart from that, the user interface of the app is also very nice. You get notifications for every steps during the delivery.",
      "Far better than what assumed in the first place. Installed this app on refer by one of my friend. But believe me i am very much happy with its services and response from customer care. I had already referred a few of my friends. Its worth to use and share for others. I surely regret my choice selecting Dunzo as my needy partner for deliverables. Recently i found we can't open this app/website in laptop. Dunzo account only accept to link for 1 mobile number which is even more pathetic. Uninstall",
      "I really liked the app before but lately their services have been really poor. The order will not reach you even after 2 hours, yes that is the amount of time I had to wait. And when you are trying to talk to the representative they will give you one line response and will close the chat instead of resolving the issue. This is really poor and I might uninstall the app as well. You lost a customer here Dunzo!",
      "It is not allowing to set up pickup & delivery address. It does not have support features. Chat options has limited option to select from, options not suitable for specific issues. Should provide options to enter problem. Call support not available."

Downloaded the app, easy to create an acct. Not only do they deliver, you can pay for assemble. My driver picked up my item on time arrived at my house in record time and I'm one happy customer",
      "Don't use them...I've had two guys show up, even tho I sheduled the pick up, not only wrong day , but the wrong time. They also play with your account that you use for the move. They hold the funds (which is normal)....but they don't take the total from that, instead charging you again and making you wait to get your funds back from the original charge. No thanks and.never again. They are not upfront with there prices and unorganized in the way they do business.",
      "Quick and easy. With everything going on with this virus I had to start working from home and needed a computer desk that morning. Sam was amazing and quick! Got it within 30 min. Extremely happy with the service♥️",
      "Use a different app. I read their terms and conditions. I dont feel safe using the app. The fact that a driver can decline a request just because it doesnt match the description. I couldnt even find an option for a single couch when I was trying to book my services. This company is a scam company when they obviously dont offer a large range of descriptions and give the mover the option to cancel because of the description. Coincidence, think not.",
      "Fantastic service and the men who delivered were great. I would definitely use this app again and refer others. It's too bad Costco isn't more educated on the service! If I hadn't found a customer in the store, who raved about the service, I would have been leery to use the app. Mike and Ahmad were great!"

      "Worst app, can't trust this app. I placed a delivery for my laptop charger from my parents'home to mine, and they just returned it back to the pick up point a while after picking it up. Can't rely at all, I had to complete very important work and because I relied on this app I got into big trouble",
      "I liked the service but the address map has biggest problem. If i give correct address it points to a very different far away location. I had to manually move the pointer to the right location which took much time. Without search option on map its really hard. I noticed the bug only after the courier guy went to wrong far away location given by the map for pickup.",
      "Really helpful app for sending around stuff within Mumbai...had to send something to a friend from Powai to Wadala and service was very prompt..",
      "It's a very useless app. I scheduled my parcel 2 days earlier and they assigned a courier service also but when the date came i checked and it was looking for courier service again. And the time I schedules was 7:00pm to 7:30pm (if I'm not wrong) and they rescheduled it like 2 - 3 times and made it 11pm. Useless",
      "Extremely disappointing app, do not waste your time on it.. Even if you schedule delivery prior they are never on time. They usually arrive on the delivery time which is 1-2 hours late. Just writing 60 minutes fast delivery and scamming people with wrong information. Rubbish app! CRM sucks, they don't even respond.. Feels like computer generated messages writing apology."

      "The app is not user friendly and worst part of it is that there is no one whom you can talk to if there is an issue. There is a chat channel but does not even reply. No problem with riders but just the app which is difficult to track orders and there are sometime lags or delays. I use this app almost everyday but I think somebody really need to look in to this issue if you want to give a satisfying service to your customer.",
      "There are many improvements needed to be done with the app such as order details (to reflect payment method used and to reflect add-ons in the order status) because currently it's not detailed enough. Also, a review button in the completed orders will be helfpful. Finally, a \"chat w/ restaurant\" option in the order status might also help to chat w/ the restaurant directly in the event you forgot to specify or mention something regarding your order.",
      "The app itself is great and simple to use. Problem lies in the partnership with local restaurants. There is not a whole lot of choices, plus many are frequently temporarily unavailable to order. P.S. the app is still in the first few months of operations in Yangon where I order. Hopefully things will get better over time.",
      "I can easily use this app and order everyday but my location keeps on changing and it is not accurately pointed at my location, because of this I had to cancel my orders and try again if it can properly point at my location but no luck it never did. Even games such as Pokemon and others can locate my current position accurately but this app just can't. This frustrates me a lot because I do want the foods they offer.",
      "This is a very good app and really helpful. It gives so many discounts and vouchers. The delivery charge is also free. But the problem is that it is a zone based service. As a result we can't order from any restaurant's which is outside of the zone. I prefer to fix an amount of delivery charge outside of the zone so that we can buy foods from any restaurant's."

This app is an actual joke. It's sad to see how downhill it really went. It's upsetting that I spent 10mins downloading this first instead of UberEats or some other one. That's how bad it is. Also, get a graphics designer to help update your app. It looks like someone in a college class designed this app for a class project.",
      "Although my favorite restaurant was on their list, apparently it no longer is. App let me go through the entire order process up until the Place Order point, and then just froze. Tried at least a half dozen times to Place Order thinking I was doing something wrong. Out of frustration (and hunger), cancelled app & installed a different one. There is also a small charge on my bank account which appears to be from some company affiliated with DD. Bank is investigating. Thought app was free? Beware",

      "It forces me to use the same liquor store for everything that's 4 towns over when there's a dozen other stores between my house and there. It also tells me that the store it's forcing me to buy from is closed at 4pm. I checked online, they're open until 8pm. So I couldn't even make a purchase even if I wanted to. There's definitely a lot more work to be put into this service.",
      "Since they \"updated\" it the app simply and only gives you the cheapest price of all the sources. Understand each source (store) has a minimum. You have to reach the minimum of each store to get charged a $5 fee. If you want two different items, the least expensive of each is from two different stores, you have to order more from each store to reach the minimum. There are no other options. Bad move on their side.",
      "I absolutely love minibar!!!!! I can't say enough about how great this app is! I have ordered from it 3 times now.. my local store the order gets sent to is Burnham Mart in Chicago. I usually order Camarena Tequila and the price is basically what is pay at the store. There have been items not available that I've ordered but they call within 5 minutes of placing the order and ask me if I would like it substituted for something else. Delivery has been around 30 minutes each time and if you can sign up for shoprunner, it's free delivery always! The staff at Burnham are great and I am very appreciative for the service they provide!!",
      "first time using app .the driver was here in 30 min . and nice n professional.this app is pretty awesome...maybe estimated time of arrival is needed.. but I'm super satisfied",
      "The app is easy to use. Very and friendly customer service. i was able to contact the delivery vendor easily. Thier delivery was on time and successful."

      "Pros: fast delivery, nice interface. Cons: awful support team, glitches with promo codes. I had (and still have) a promo code for a free delivery, was charged the full price for the delivery. The only suggestion from the support team (or a chatbot) was to 'reinstall the app', because they did not see any promo codes on my account. That's probably a bug, or intentionally deceptive advertising.",
      "False advertising: if a supermarket appears you expect to be able to order what they have. But you can't. Only a crippled subset. UX mistakes abound. Poor navigation, you can lose your cart. All the more apalling when you see \"delightful\" animations. This is the stuff dystopias are made of. Not surprised by Luddites when techies drop the ball like this.",
      "Today installed this and made my order. It seemed convenient, but there were a lot of issues. Here's the story: 1.My card was charged twice for the amount of order. 2.I received my order, one payment was cancelled. Weird, but whatever. 3.In couple hours my card was charged again for an amount slightly larger than the original one. 4.In couple more mins there was one more attempt to change my card, but was rejected, I assume by my bank. Support can't explain this and responds in foreign language",
      "Blown away by this app, got it for McDonalds delivery + discovered a world of restaurants to try. Great interface (photos of products to browse), low delivery fee, lots of special offers/discount codes. Not just food but also shops(KIKO!!😍). Speedy + hassle free; couriers find location no problem (unlike other delivery services). I think we got priority service with KFC as food came ridiculously fast (15-20mins). Tracks courier with GPS so can see progress in real time. Thank you GLOVO!",
      "Not bad, but could be better. I can't find some products in the supermarket section yet they are obviously stocked up in the supermarket. You should regularly update the app's supermarket items to sync them with the actual products, and prices."

      "The app is severely annoying for foreigners for two reasons. First, you can not pay with any option that is not in person as you need a CPF for that and it is very bothersome to get one. Second, the in person payment option is not always available because ifood does not provide sufficient machines to the delivery personal and so you need to wait randomly and annoyingly until one delivery person with a machine is avaliable. This sucks as you are probably somebody who values his or her time.",
      "Very nice app, could have the option to debit directly from your bank account, discount coupons are not accepted by most restaurants",
      "It is a love-hate situation with this app. While it is really useful showing restaurants nearby and their menu, iFood's payment system is really annoying and may simply refuses your credit card for no apparent reason, which make the use of their coupons impossible. Besides, it is not rare for your order to arrive late, wrong or not arrive at all.",

      "I really like this pizza app. It's very clean and simple to use. I like that I can see the whole menu on one page and it saves my information, even previous orders so I can order it again! Very well done! I also liked that I got an email when the order reached the kitchen. The only problem I saw was there were no drinks list. I don't know if it's the fault of the app or the specific restaurant.",
      "Promo codes don't work as advertised. I was emailed a code good for $3 off a minimum purchase of $10.50+ AFTER discounts, but the code wouldn't work until my purchase was $13, so there goes the value of that coupon. App is not the most user friendly. Barely any restaurants on here. Grub hub is simpler and more reliable.",
      "(Update 2/26/2020: Still loving this app). Love this app. I do wish more pizza shops would get on it. Love the coupons I get from the app and the contests they do. And I love how they don't over run me with junk emails. It's so easy to just open the app and pick which place we want to order from and have it only take a few clicks.",
      "Not great, but gave it a go. Kept glitching and it wasnt seamless trying to get what you want done. Also, I used the app for the first time, which was supposed to include a $5 discount. That did not happen. Not entirely sure we'll be using this again, unfortunately. The annoyance wasn't worth it.",
      "After several uses they start charging you covert fees without telling you. I used the app 3 times thinking that it was always free (there's no mention that it's not free), and on the 4th use a 50 cent fee showed up in the fine print right as I placed the order. Needless to say, I'm not too thrilled about their lack of pricing transparency and I'm removing the app permanently. @Slice Pizza Rep: The app description never mentions that you use a paid service model, which seems very deliberate."

      "First time using this app. It was easy to download, sign up, and use on the first go. I had a hot and fresh pizza for my family within 30 minutes. I had no line to wait for. Went to the pick up portal when I got my push notification, scanned my phone and was in and out of the store within 60 seconds. Really appreciate having the option to order ahead and grab something quickly on the way home or to wait in store and decide. Great Job Little Caesars!",
      "Super easy to use! I've used it 3 times in the last 2 weeks and I love it. I can order a specialty pizza and pick it when I get there instead of always getting the pepperoni pizza because it's convenient and quick. The pizza is always on time on the heat portal. I just put in the 3 digit code and get my hot pizzas. Love it! I'm so glad I started using it.",
      "Pizza has always been great, its the app that sucks. I've been thinking that this app was broken for about 6 months now, because everytime i tried to place an order it would just say \"Yikes! There was a problem\" This whole time the problem was that the CC info was expired. The date had expired. Had it alerted me to that fact instead of just saying \"Yikes!\", They probably wouldnt missed out on a fair amount of pizza sales. Fix the stupid error codes to be more specific.",
      "The app is fine and works as it is suppose to. I think a point system or something could improve the restaurant itself, but for the propose of this review and speaking of the app. Itself it is working and doing exactly what it was made for. You order your pizza and pay for it with your card on the app making it quick and painless. Why only 4 stars?? Its not perfect and could use some type of reward system for using the app.",
      "Originally I rated the app 5 stars. It functions just fine, but it posts to your Facebook profile without notifying you. So thank you Little Caesars, all of my Facebook friends probably think I'm a weirdo for posting 8 Little Caesars ads in a row. Not to mention the other things in app permissions; including disabling your phone's autolock feature and controlling vibration settings. It's not worth it lol"

      "It's really a hit or miss with this app based service. Is it not possible to build a feature in the app which indicates high demand in an area, which might possibly lead to a bit of a delay? It's not fair to a paying customer when they spend time picking a restaurant with a quick ETA of 25 mins and immediately after placing the order, it changes to 65 mins. Plus, you don't even realize your order hasn't been confirmed by the restaurant due to no driver until you contact customer service",

      "The app works great. Very handy for finding new places to order out from. I appreciate that it accepts Google Pay as a payment method. My only complaint is that it's missing the obvious feature of letting you favorite restaurants for faster navigation. As for the service itself, I have nothing but postives. The drivers are competent, timely and pleasant. It makes things easy and convenient especially for cryptids like myself. I recommend this entirely.",
      "The app should have a better procedure for refunds, instead of just giving skip credits immediately. It should be my choice. The app should have a little better detailed filters. With the ability to choose multiple filters. App should be able to have sorting options as well, ex. By rating, by closeness, by delivery charge, by coupons, etc. Great app in general, but needs some improvement.",
      "I would say this app is great for convenience, but other than that, you deal with more problems ordering through them, then taking some time to go get it or cook. Even when trying to express problems to the customer service, it seems as though theres no real care for your satisfaction. I have had many issues, and actually lost a good chunk of cash, even when expressed skip did very little to rectify the situation.",
      "Recently the app seems to have been changed, where you now have to enter the buzzer code and apt no every time you make an order. It is simpler to set it up once only. Otherwise, good app, easy to order, and see where your order is. The help desk is very responsive and helpful. Please ask all restaurants to label if dishes contain dairy.",
      "App is easy to use. The selection of food / restaurants is good, not exceptional but still worth a look. I have used this app five times now and am very happy with it. When in final stages of ordering there is a choice of the percentage for the tip but there is the option to enter an amount. Skip The Dishes says the drivers get the total amount of the tip; very good of them to make sure the drivers are fairly paid."

      "I really like the app and working for Doordash. It's a great summer job, but there are a lot of glitches that make the app frustrating to use. One example is location services are slow to update. I could be sitting in the customer's driveway, but the app will tell me I'm not close enough. Also, the app will sometimes give me a delivery that's 15 mins. away, but only give me 10 mins. in which to pick it up.",
      "It won't let me log into my account. I know the password is correct because I tried it online on the Doordash Dasher site just now. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it and restarted my phone as well. Not sure what's going on with the app. Updated 3/17: I still can't log into the app on my phone. I'm starting to think the app isn't compatible for the Samsung Galaxy S9. I've emil Dasher support. I'm currently waiting for a response.",
      "The app seems to be running much better than it has in the past with minor issues and so i'm giving it a higher rating. If i'm using the map for directions then i'm also recieving texts that says i've missed a run for not responding. There needs to be a sound notification like the other driving apps that lets me know what's going on in the background.the map is often wrong so i have to use a secondary source for accuracy. The pay rate needs to be much higher. My decline rate is all your fault.",
      "Was working fine until my phone had an update on Saturday. I've downloaded and re downloaded the app and it's still not working. It acts like it will after I log in but then just goes back to the login page. I have the samsung galaxy s9 and now I cannot log in. I have spoken with customer service and they are still researching this issue 24 hours later. I need to be on and driving to make an income. Please look into this soon and send a fix!",
      "Have not been able to log into my account for a little over a week now. Every time I try to log in, it directs me right back to the login screen. I did every troubleshooting method I could regarding this matter and when I called support they just told me to do everything I had already done. I enjoy working through Doordash and would like to continue. I hope this issue can be resolved."

      "At first the app didn't want to work. Then, when after a fresh install I purchased some flowers, only to be confronted with hidden fees that I thought was an error in reporting the bill. All in all, dishonest company with a clunky, ill-conceived app.",
      "Cant use crashes upon opening still cant use ! I uninstalled an re tried , still crashing",
      "After the latest update, it crashes every time I start it."

And when I logged in to my account after reinstalling Box 8 on my new phone, my 20 orders 180 days Box 8 pass for 25% off has vanished. Please try to fix that. It was valid till May, I clearly remember. And I didn't order 20 times, hardly 3-5.",
      "Over Priced !! Everything here is over priced, and the Box8 Pass is an absolute joke. They just double charge you and then give you a 10% discount and share it as they are doing a big favour. Which is completly unfair, where apps like Swiggy & Zomato are playing a fair game. With this review, i am uninstalling the app. Adios Box8. A disheartned Box8 Pass Customer.",
      "It used to be great, but the recent update completely crashed the tracking screen. Now, I don't have an option to call the delivery person, and neither does the tracking option work. I can't see the live position of the delivery person. The only way I know my delivery is out for order is via a notification, with no further information about the ETA from the app. Do fix this.",
      "No proper tracking, No chat and mail support(options added in application as dummy), once you order food for lunch, delivery person will travel around the world and reach you for dinner. Once you ordered you can't cancel because delivery person is on the way ,on the way , on the way ,on the way...... Worst application and worst food delivery network. Order today receive tomorrow -Tagline for Box 8.",
      "Food ordering should be hassle free, this is opposite, the app does not work most times, else there is some problem or other. The prices for the most ordered food also is manipulated. Have seen prices rise by over 35% in last 4 months. Avoid this app."

      "Very good app. Bought my 1st purchase ( buy4u) yesterday. Although i wish the rm 100 cap could be increased a little bit. Maybe for the buy4u insurance you could implement to be paid 1st by the customer. Just a suggestion",
      "First time using the app and I can say that I will patrionizing this one. Fast delivery and very accomodating drivers. However, it'll be awesome if we can chat the drivers inside the app instead of using regular load.",
      "Reliable and most helpful among all apps out there. I am really and very much satisfied with your service",
      "Useful app but drivers are taking advantage of app users. Like this one time, a ream of cups would definitely exceed the box but the rider charged 40 pesos because it exceeded the size of the box. My staff could have just split the quantity of the cups so it would not exceed the box. I don't even see a rule in your app that you have to pay extra for that. If you report something like this through email support, you will get no action too.",
      "Not good. Always having a delivery problem status. Manila and Caloocan areas have 2 similar area of choice with no proper distinction. Cannot book the delivery without the AREA selection first then followed by the home address. Kindly, update your GPS. The GPS of Grab and Angkas are much better than yours. Why not derived your GPS from the ones they have or use."

      "Neat app. There are tons of bugs, one main issue is the tolls, you have to submit a copy of the tolls in order to get reimbursed for them, which is a huge pain, and to add to this issue, you are supposed to submit the receipt of the tolls upon completion of the gig. Another issue is customer service is hit or miss as to whether you will actually get someone when you call, or it will say, sorry no one is available to help you right now. -edit* downloaded the beta app, it looks promising",
      "Changes have been made but not for the better in my opinion. The app and its logic are lacking in several ways. I receive notifications of gigs very sporadically the last week or two. Unless I'm by the airport or pharmacy/hub physically, I'm not getting gigs anymore either Maybe because they hired tons of new drivers for Walmart? Sad.",
      "First time I've used the app and for whatever reason my gig was canceled and I was charged $10! On top of that I ended up having to drive to the airport to pick up my bag. The app was difficult to navigate and the cancelling of my gig made no sense!!",
      "I signed up but haven't ran any gigs yet. This app doesn't seem to be real popular in Texas yet especially here in Houston since only the two airports use them. And they are located on total opposite sides of the city north and south. I have to drive 25 miles to 1 or 15 miles to the other forget that don't seem to pay very well for the distance you have to deliver. I didn't found for me driving 20 to 35 miles across a major metropolitan area for twenty bucks NAHH",
      "I've done 2 trips with Delta. I've had no problems so far. DELTA in Des Moines IA are quick to help you. This is a great side hustle! App needs work though, its not the smoothest running app and notifications dont show up right away, you have to keep checking the app.. Oh.. and more badge would be fun :)"

      "The worst by far delivery service. You started out just fine, but now I can't imagine you can get worse. I already uninstalled your app. It is not about the app, it is about the service itself. For weeks every time I order the order is cancelled because \"one of my order items is not available \", \"the restaurant cancelled the order\", \"no delivery person is available \". one order took two hours to be canceled at the end.

      "This app covers all of the details so that we can easily utilize a coupon and select if we want to have items be applied to 1/2 or the whole pizza. The carryout special comes in handy also for us. I love how they keep track of our points and we can decide how much of our Papa John's points will be applied to our bill.",
      "It lost the extra two stars because first of all if you accidentally exit out of your tracking section to see where your pizza is at it does not save your tracking so that means your lost when they're coming so you really have to be out on a lookout and 2nd I hate it when apps like this blow my phone up with notifications saying \"oh try our new special blah blah blah And all this for only $19.99!\" Yay. Other than that it works so that's cool.",
      "I changed my phone number and the phone number changed back. I do expect better service coming from this application be in the fact that it has worked for me for so long. I think this is a lot better than door - where I get horrible customer service I just hope that you can fix this",
      "Love being able to browse the menu and not feel rushed to make a decision. Great app, easy to use. Promo codes are nice to use and we can usually use a Promo with our Papa Dough, got an even bigger discount.",
      "Love it. Easy to use, all the deals are there, easy to customize/edit orders, and the tracker is awesome. You can also pay extra for Papa Priority to get your delivery quicker. Plus on top of all of that the rewards are great! Those new Jalapeño Poppers are lit!"

For instance your food gets delayed or arrive in bad shape, they try to throw some discount coupons to resolve your issue. That's insane. Also for basics, if you request that the delivery boy should ring the bell, the instruction goes unnoticed. Even if you ask them not to send cutlery they don't inform restaurant",

I selected junction which is only 300meters away from my actual home, then all the restaurants were available, so I added the food to my cart and then went into the cart and changed the location back to my actual one and then I ordered the food. I used to order food to this location. But now error in the app.",

Therefore everytime I have to un-instal the app and re-install again each and every time. Also 30% off,40% off and 50% off max value of discount is always ₹75.. if you can atleast stop generating pop-ups and make sure that the app does starts processing by its own then I would be really happy to keep the app installed.",
      "There is an issue with coupons application. It's written 50 Percent off but actually we don't get it. Only some times it is allowed. Kind of disappointing. I have brought this issue up several times with your customer service but never got satisfactory response. If you don't want to give the consumer actual discount then why do you claim to give. !

Tried to log in. Told password not valid. Spent an hour changing password 3x before successful log in. Frustrated with finding items from long aisle lists so searched each item. Placed order early Tue a.m. Was given pick up date-Thurs at 1 p.m. Tues p.m. received email that pick up was cancelled.",
      "I really enjoyed this app, however every order lately (and I order every week) the list of things on the \"out of stock\" items is growing! Basic items. I spend time shopping the app. And now double the time because i actually have to go in the store and shop for my items they were \"out of stock\" on. Uggg so frustrating."

      "The app is has modern look, easy to personalize, and the variety of quality restaurants is abundant . It is handy to use not only for food ordering but groceries, flowers and medicines too.",
      "Please do something about saving address, it always ask about address when placing a new order, why it can't be saved ! It's nice and easy app though.",
      "The app is fantastic and the customer service is excellent! However, the restaurants are letting the app down by being 1. Unrealibe, 2. Ignoring special requests, 3. Not being consistent in food quality. Overall, it's great and I recommend it for its variety of restaurants and convenience."

If you use your vehicle for work just click a button to track your miles driven to and from jobs on that app. Then you get compensation when tax time comes around.",
      "Not many project jobs to take and to many drivers because I get 1 project request per week and by the time I open the app to accept project it says project is no longer available because someone else already took it even though I opened app as soon as I get notify. This has been going on for for more than a month so this is not job security because you have to be awake and aware all the time waiting for the app to let you know that there is a project available.",
      "App works but instructions for customer's aren't clear. People should be prompted if they need a helper before completing project. I have accepted many projects where the customer didn't request helper but needed one. Also takes way to long to disperse payments driver retention will drop if they don't figure out a way to increase payments speed.",
      "Every since I have had this app I have not been able to receive any jobs. When a job does come through I try to accept it and it say the the job is now available",
      "It seems that the app delays acceptance of jobs for people who have a pick up trucks and favors cargo vans maybe because it's a higher rate. I have been looking directly at the app and accepted a job as soon as It pops up and there is always a lag. I have accepted a job and arrived and the police were waiting for me and was questioned. a criminal was using the app to delivery goods bought with a stolen credit card. Reported it too go share they didn't even pay me for my time and fuel wasted."

      "The latest update to this app does not let it run in the background. If im online and go do something else while im waiting for an offer, when i come back to the app it says \"Looks like your offline\" and refreshes. Please FIX this. It was never like this and it also marks you absent if you dont have only the Grubhub screen on. This is ridiculous!",
      "It's pretty good, but cannot detect when you have arrived or are leaving the restaurant. \"Delivered\" button is easy to acvidentally tap when arriving at the diner's location or gathering everything to take to the door. Should be a swipe or second tap to confirm. It takes days to switch bank cards/accounts. Maps should be better integrated. It doesn't calculate distances or ETAs to the pick up and drop off to help the driver judge if he can make the pickup or delivery on time.",
      "No longer working on Galaxy Note 8. I uninstalled and reinstalled 5+ times. Restarted my phone countless times. When I try to open the app, it shows a blank white screen for about 5-10 seconds, and then return to my phone's app screen. It closes itself out. It keeps doing this. BEFORE THIS, the app wouldn't constantly log itself out and vibrate continuously with the login screen continously sliding. Thank God I have the Samsung J7, works on that with WiFi/Hotspot. Or else I'd have no income.",
      "The new update 3.8 screwed my app up. In the middle of a job after I updated it the app crashed. It would not open up again. I tried deleting and reinstalling several times, restarting the phone. Nothing worked. Luckily I had 2 phones and my other phone was an iPhone. I downloaded it there and had no issues. I deleted the update 3.8 and looked online for the last stable update 3.54. After I downloaded that one everything worked out fine. DON'T UPDATE TO 3.8!! Wait for the next update.",
      "this app is one of the better written ones. The best is still doordash's app but this one is a close second period The only thing that is annoying is having to go to tasks after accepting an offer It's on a whole separate screen I don't see why they just don't make it go up on the screen you're on like the door dash app. This would help a lot especially when you're driving because you get these offers when you're driving It's the nature of the job Make it easier for us"

Also alot of the time cash tips are given on credit cards. And that is accounted differently. If credit card has a tip that gets paid on my paycheck as opposed to cash tips.

The answer I got is to wait for a month and in that time they will have added my area. 4 months have past and there is no slightest progress.

      "Great service, great people, great app",
      "Dumpling is a great alternative to exploitative gig economy services -- but the app needs a _lot_ of work to be user-friendly. For example: 1) It took me many tries to find the list of items that I bought, which is hidden behind the name of the store (absolutely counter-intuitive); 2) You have to remember to manually save certain actions like adding notes, or they'll just be forgotten, 3) Sometimes you delete items by selecting \"0\", sometimes by clicking a \"Trash\" icon, 4) You can't create custom items from a failed search result (that should be the default); 5) Simple quality of life features (e.g. \"no results for polato, here are results for potato\") are not implemented. If the company is too small to fix these issues, maybe open source the app so others can help?",
      "It would be nice if the shopper can add items into the shopping list app while they are shopping. And even better if the shopper can leave a note of the changes in the order",
      "Amazing service! I get the same personal shopper every time and they can shop ANY store debit and credit cards are accepted. Highly recommend.",
      "My first time using it was a disaster. They flagged my card and put a 50$ hold on my card it was just a mess Okay I will update this!!! My \"shopper\" messaged me asking me questions after questions why I rated them so low it's very unprofessional and this was absolutely disgusting I cannot believe that someone who shopped one time and and gets 20 by the driver. I will never use this again."

      "Update The app is smooth and working flawless now From 3 stars giving it 1 star as they again didn't show up. But what pissed me off is the lack of customer alerts as they want you to give calls ans check the status.(you can take them only as plan b or alternative) While even every other app sents an easy notification, I don't see that happening for them. While the negatives are of this sort the app developers have put a very neat and easy app to order and operations team a big thumbs down",
      "Love the timely service and products but an essential part of a shopping app is missing, there is no orders page, no past order summary and no invoices. I cannot go back and see how much I've paid for an item I've ordered in the past. Update: dropping the rating further as I'm facing a lot of quality issues. Every single time I'm told that the issue will not be repeated but then it happens again."

      "We use this for our small dairy delivery business in the U.S. It's easy to use, fairly intuitive, and reasonably priced. Best features (for us) are route optimization, SMS delivery notification, and the mobile app. Mobile UI could stand a bit of a redesign to be more intuitive for drivers, but once you learn it it's easy. Would also be nice if driving directions were native in the app rather than punting to Google Maps...currently you have to switch back and forth when you arrive/depart if you're getting directions. Not a huge problem, but just enough of a hassle to make you aware that you're doing extra work as you use it.",

The only other package delivery app I've ever used had this feature and it was pretty nice. As of now you have to manually enter the carrier yourself even after inputting the tracking number. This is my only \"wish\", but it's a very small issue in comparison to how well the app actually works.",
      "It's a good app, used to be that is. Now it has become super annoying with daily full screen nagging about permission for personalized ads. I give the permission but each day it comes again, trying to push me to buy the ad-free version. Bugger! Time to look for another tracking app. Edit: after a couple of updates the problem disappeared. Therefore I'm giving it now 4 stars instead of the original 2 :-)",
      "Exactly what I need when I have multiple incoming orders from different shipping providers from around the world. I also think this app might be more trustworthy with my data compared to other similar apps (you can see the country that the developer registers themselves under).",
      "Awesome app. Consolidates all my deliveries in one central location and updates me in a timely manner. Incredibly useful for big batch of deliveries like my new PC build order(s) that I'm waiting on.",
      "This app is great tracking packages it can show on the map details and you can watch as the carriers dont move your packages for days sometimes. This app is accurate and is the best for tracking multiple different carriers."

Maybe something like, free delivery after so many orders, or save $_ after spending $_. Or maybe a point system to earn rewards. Just s suggestion but please keep up the great work!",
      "When I got this app I was disappointed with the lack of options at first but ignored it. Then upon finding what we wanted to order we were unable to add the item to our cart or scroll in the item menu, i couldn't see all of the toppings or add the pizza to my order.",
      "I have used this app several times now, more often than not food arrived before the estimated delivery time. Food is always hot, no missing items. Drivers are friendly, even on bad weather days. One time my order was late but that was because when our driver picked up the food it was cold and he asked them to remake it. Prices may be a little steep, and restaurant options are limited in my area, but the quality of the food and customer service is well worth it.",
      "Loved ordering from them and when I worked for them it was a great environment and the money actually went to the drivers & and not a corporate giant. I highly recommend PRD if you want your money to be reinvested in your home town community, you want quick and professional delivery, and service that will go out of their way to make sure you have the best experience.",

I read some of the other species and see that others have had this same problem. so now my review is actually a question.. why hasn't this issue been fix yet? will it ever be fix or should we just delete the game?",

      "Love Love Love this! My husband and I hate to cook and this is an amazing option for dinners. It's ready in about 5 minutes and tastes like it was just freshly made and not microwaved. Everything is delicious and healthy. It's easy to tell that its fresh ingredients when you taste it. Plenty of options although I wish they would do more fish cuz the few times they have its Absolutely delicious! App is easy too! This has changed our lives and opened up so much time in the evening! Many thanks!",
      "The app works fine, but the food has definitely declined in quality and value since I signed up a little less than a year ago. And unless you like chicken, chicken, or chicken, I'd suggest passing entirely. UPDATE 3/10: freshly responds one way here, but today I receive an order consisting of meals I didn't order and can't eat. Just called them and their responses to credit me 11 bucks... Nothing they can do to get any food 2 me before my next order. Guess you shouldn't complain publicly?",
      "This is amazing. Medical issues were the reason I started this, but taste, ease if use- the skip feature! - even changing the plan as needed... all these make Freshly great if you don't prepare meals. I don't and now I get fresh prepared meals I genuinely like. Worth it. I'm on the 12 meal plan. I've skipped a week with no issues. It comes the day I scheduled every week, no hassle. This is a blessing for my health, my nutritional need, to take to work! I'm picky and these taste GREAT!!",
      "Couldn't be easier! Order, deliver, heat and enjoy. I've tried several of the meals in the low calorie section and I've enjoyed every one. Really delicious food. And it saves me money. Shopping and cooking for one is challenging and I found myself throwing out so much food. Now I'm not wasting a thing!",
      "I really like freshly. I have a tendency to get busy and then eat out instead of making dinner. Having the healthy and delicious options delivered every week and the fact that you just need to microwave them has changed my eating habits for the better. I also like that the menu changes and they email you new options, it keeps me from getting bored. My only critique is that they are a bit pricey compared to store bought meals, or cooking. But they are less than fast food, and way better for me."

      "Useless app. Tried booking a move, took forever. Driver didn't show up, support was non existent",
      "The movers are awesome but they are not upfront about the price they quote you for on thing and then are waaay off about the actual price. And they have alot of hidden fees they like the add, which leaves u better off just using a regular moving company."

      "Update has been a mixed bag. Though the scanner is noticeably faster with the update, the scanner placement has to be just right the first time or else I have to re-scan. Also, the \"almost done\" text notification pops up but does not connect to my messaging app. I have also experienced app freezing, particularly during order processing. In fact, overall order processing time in the app could be improved. On a positive note, I am no longer having to re-take receipt pictures with the update.",
      "Since the most recent update, I cannot even open the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail. I continue to get prompts for promo orders though. However, as the pay rate has continued to diminish, it may just be time for me and Shipt to part ways. Not worth the two hours of driving, shopping, and delivering for $11.",
      "Needs improvement. Needs to be easier to substitute items or force add something when the barcode wont scan. Needs to show the price for items as this can help you find the right thing. Needs isle numbers for some stores as the categories system can out two things in the same categories even if they are on different sides of the store. No pay for mileage so you can only accept the limited number of orders nearby. The worst part is support takes 15-30min to get and help. Even on an active order.",
      "They just launched a new version of the application, and with everything digital you have to wonder what they were thinking? Who did they ask for information? Big change, let's give it more color and make it harder on humans eyes. I can't wait to lose more of my eyesight! Why do I have to see my profile picture? The font is smaller! When you created this did you use it as a practical application, or did you think , we want it to look cool! Getting an alert at 50 mph with 60 seconds to claim!",
      "So far the new app updates are working great for me. EXCEPT the issue that I cannot access my delivery history prior to December 2019. Hoping my communications with HQ will get this resolved quickly as it is a necessary tool I use to reconcile for tax prep. I am not the only Shopper with this issue."

I use delivery I actually got help via the BOT that gave me what I needed..not Amazon(on hold 45 min & bot hung up)and just try to update my payment with new card..that took, seriously 3 DAYS and its still not done! Im looking for a new cellphone service asap. Dont use SHIPT OR those services they charge too much Stay aware stay safe STAY HOME..DONT HOARD please",

I get to the page with the TOS checkbox & a drop down asking how you heard about the app. However, when select continue, it errors out stating i have to enter a valid vons club card number. There is no where to enter the number on that page or any of the prevoius pages, so i cannot use the app.",
      "App registration failures! Very very poor customer service to fix it. I had the same error with entering my phone number as with the other 1 star reviews. There are data entry conflicts that migrate across the desktop page & several apps with no way to confirm or fix these issues - rerouting to customer support.",

Literally the best, other apps do not deliver to some location but this app delivers to many locations in Hyderabad and the personal assistant option is very good. Deliveries may be a bit late as they deliver to even faraway locations but it's not a big deal considering their work",
      "This app is good and the UI is clean and efficient .In my phone at some places the some layout items are not correctly aligned , for example in the order page \"Any instructions ?\" text is hidden under \"coupon code \" link . Except for that this app is great . Good luck developer .",
      "When i first came across this app i thought it was too good to be true because it didn't have one bad review. I thought the app is rigged and i was scared to order. But then i got exactly what i wanted and with reasonable fee charged. I really like this app. One thing I'd like to change is the tracking system. It would be helpful to have an live tracking system and the updates shown on the app are slow. I got my delivery but the app showed that the agent was still on his way. Loved it"
