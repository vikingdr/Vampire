      "I used to play this game a year ago, it was lovely. Since I've downloaded it again, the ads are ridiculous. So many ads you can't even play the game and nothing to purchase to get rid of the ads as i like the game enough to pay a couple of bucks to make it ad free. Just recently its also crashing every 2 minutes or so, impossible to play between crashing, long loading time, and ads. Super disappointing for such a fun game otherwise.",
      "I like that game, but now im starting to get annoyed. I built the research department and added staff members to start a research. The research wont start and it wont allow me to remove the staff members. I could be using those staff members to complete missions. Please fix this. It says the game has been updated. I havent played in months. I open the game, but everything is still the same.",
      "It's a great game, but after less than 24 hours of game play, it just exits the game all the time. I can't get anything done. Sometimes it wont even load all the way before it just exits out. Very disappointing because I was liking the game very much. I cleared the cache, 5 times. So that is NOT the solution. And, I see a lot of players having the same issue with no response. I even spent money already. I would hate to delete, but if this cant be fixed, its not worth the frustration.",
      "Really love this game, but like others I am dissatisfied with how the game has been operating lately. I dont have any problems with it crashing like everyone else, but I have 2 of my doctors stuck in research for 2 weeks now. I cant use them for anything because they are locked in there with no count down. Also disappointed that there have not been any events for 3 months. Will change my rating when issues are resolved. You guys have over 10 million downloads can you get it together for us plz",
      "The game is so fun and worth the money it will suck you in. And then it will start closing out on you all the time after you play it a little bit and you can't get the app to open for long or run right. I'm seeing a lot of people had this complaint about a week ago. The problem is still not fixed yet. Sucks because this game really could be awesome."

      "This is an excellent resource for urgent care or psychological or psychiatric care. Messaging or calling support staff are convenient options. Scheduling is convenient and it integrates with calendar for appointment reminders. The only downsides are: 1) There is no timer for 50-minute sessions to show remaining time, so watch the clock! 2) Searching for a doctor by a specific specialty is not possible without reading the biography for each doctor.",
      "I cannot recommend this app enough. Between therapy visits and medical doctor visits I have not only saved time and money but I know I've improved my health in ways I couldn't or wouldn't have otherwise. This is a changemaker in our society and I only wish those without insurance had an affordable option. Next step, hopefully. Everyone deserves care.",
      "This is perfect for common ailments that usually costs us $$$ to go to a dr office or clinic to be treated. The app was so easy to use no technical difficulty. They let me know she was running behind but it literally was only a few minutes. I would have had to waste a whole day to go to an urgent care or ER. You get to pick your Dr by reading their Bio and availability time. Highly recommend this app especially if your insurance allows. New era of medical care!",
      "The service is top notch but the app could use some updating. The volume level was very low in the video chat even though I had it turned all the way up to MAX. When entering a credit card it would fail when I used my phone's camera to enter the 16 digit card number but worked fine when I entered it all manually.",
      "This is an EXCELLENT resource for when you cannot get to a clinic or get in to see your PCP the same day. It's a REAL doctor visit with knowledgeable, professional doctors. I actually prefer this service versus going to see my doctor in the clinic or hospital setting. Plus, my medical insurance covered the visit 100%, so no co-pay."

      "This app is horrible you have to buy all all of the rooms except one which one of the rooms only and you only get to play with such few characters in the characters can't even hold anything even though it's only $3 I need my money for the Coronavirus. This app is horrible don't play it..",
      "It is all AMAZING! Except that they only give you like the bottom floor and 1 room! And that they only give you like 7 characters not even! And if you pay they give you 13 rooms (Wich is all of them) and 30 Characters (Wich is all of them) But you have to pay to get a lot of things but if it unlocked more characters and rooms for free I'd give it 5 stars.",
      "Its soooooooooooo boring game im tired of playing in only one room, i mean to say that in this game there is only one room for Playing and the ground floor you can not play it for so long and plz don't download this game plz don't waste your time playing these games and remember don't play any series of \"play toddlers\" by the way kids will love it 😅",
      "The other two stars are only for the rooms,the person who create this game can you actually make all the rooms free for us to visit and when i wanted to buy they say buys are not avaible what kind of thing is this",
      "Boring and otherwise the other rooms are free we can enjoy because I like this game but little boring so make the other room free then anybody who this gaming even they will know this game then this game can be in trending so I have a only one wish that in this game make everything free And I like this game 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃"

      "I've loved every Heart's Medicine game that's come out so far. Since I'm stuck inside I figured I'd finally try this one. HOWEVER, this one has been glitchy since the moment I started it up. First, the sound wouldn't work. So, I shut down my chromebook and tured it back on. Now it won't open literally more than 2 seconds before shutting down. This needs to be fixed! I can't move on to the next HM game until I know the story from THIS one!",
      "Love the game, but I'm having an issue with it saying I have all of these energy reserves (2 orange juices and 5 salads) when I actually don't. I went to try and use one and kept getting an error message because they aren't really there when it says they are.",
      "Love this game and the characters are awesome!! The only thing I'd like to see among all the games actually is to have them in some sort of order so I know which to play first, second etc... other than that I have no complaints!!!",
      "It's a great game however I just wish that the minigames didn't take the same amount of energy as the main story and that the energy wouldn't take so long to charge. There should be a way of buying energy with diamonds or hearts.",
      "Great game, but lost progress.. I got a new phone and have had my progress wiped :( have to start over :( I don't have my previous game key. And I updated because it says update and get a free gift and all the keys are removed? Is that over now? I also bought a pack with an apple drink and meal, got a receipt and it isn't on my game! So many issues! It was better before when you could just buy the game for 7.99 or something and play the whole thing!"

      "I don't usually write reviews for apps that I use ,but this game is really wonderful . My 2 years old loves it ,we even role-played the game with our dolls. I like that it gives a back story to every injury and that some of them have a moral value for my toddler ,like don't eat too much candy or don't play under the rain . My only concern is the relative difficulty in some requirements for young ages ,like the owl's x-ray or the dropping drug bottle to aim kn the animals' mouths.",
      "My daughter loves this app. I would gladly pay for an ad free version but I don't see the option to. She hasn't played it in awhile so when she played it today I was surprised to see so many ads. She downloaded 2 apps in under 2 minutes by accident. Please add either a buy out option or some kind of lock system that prevents unwanted downloads. Thank you!",
      "My two year old loves this game, which is great, but she clicked on an ad and Post Malone's \"Rockstar\"started to play. Wouldn't be a big complaint, but her tablet literally blasted obscenities from an uncensored version. I clicked out of it & let her continue to play... Then a few minutes later an uncensored version of \"Motorsport\" started to play. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A CHILDREN'S GAME!! DO BETTER!!",

      "Horrible!!! I've booked different doctors, at different time, about 5 times!!! They're never avaliable, or time what shows at this app avaliable - is unavailable! They always calling me, or living messages that doctor or time what was at this app unavailable!!! Every time!!! If doctors or time is unavailable, why you put them at this app like avaliable?!!!!!! Waste of my time!!!!!! I still can't see the doctors which I need!!! Because call center continue put me on reschedule my appointment",
      "Great app, but the developer REFUSES to spend time on the sorting and filtering features in the app. You run a search for an internist and get results where 8 out of the 10 of the top 10 results don't practice adult or family medicine. A podiatrist? Really? Sort by distance and you get doctors 15 miles away before the doctor 3 miles away. C'mon guys. Do better! This app is supposed to create efficiency, right?",
      "I like the app, but a big flaw is payment. A day or so after your first appointment you will get a phonecall of someone saying they work for Zocdoc and need your credit card details in case you would cancel your appointment. This is a big security flaw, because there is no way to verify if the person actually works for Zocdoc. Payment should be part of the app itself!",
      "This app even their website are not accurate. I booked a doctor appointment only to be called and told the Doctor doesn't treat a certain condition even though Zocdoc app and website say they do. This has happened twice now. Don't know why I bothered using a third party app instead of just calling doctor offices myself.",
      "I usually love this App but it's not allowing me to make an appointment for my dad. It keeps telling me \"oops something went wrong\" everytime I try to verify the phone number. I emailed them this morning and didnt even receive a confirmation that they recieved my email."

      "Would not recommend. I didn't even get to the actual \"talk to a doctor\" portion. I took the evaluation, and entered my info. It specifically said \"IF\" I decided to go ahead and choose a prescription, I agree to be billed every month, to which I said yes. However, my card was charged, even though I didn't talk to anyone or look at any medicine. All I did was take the evaluation. Then I tried to login on the app and it's saying that it does not recognize my email or phone number, so I can't cancel",
      "This app is absolutely wonderful! When I first installed it i was doubtful of it's abilities, but everytime I have needed to figure out why I was feeling a certain way, K Health has been amazing in giving me its opinions on what could be wrong. This app is extremely helpful and I highly reccomend everybody download it!",
      "Don't bother using this app if you need a doctor's note. It will not print or save to your phone. It opens up in a weird PDF browser. I used my Samsung Galaxy S9+ and my Samsung S8 to try to download the doctor's note. It didn't work. If it weren't for the trained doctor's and the app features, I would've rated this app with one star.",
      "Bad app, $14 Waste, Less than average in symptom collection. This app signified symptoms that I did not select. The doctor thus got inaccurate information and did not ask about all symtoms (including wrong sypmtoms I did not select) and thus felt she could not prescribe anything to help me. Ugh, frustrating. I want a refund.",
      "You will waste your money on this app! It will basically guess your diagnosis but that's expected because it's an app! It's not a real doctor! If you are worried about anything going on in your body, go consultant your doctor, I can't tell you how much happier you will be too that way."

      "I was under the assumption that as long as you watched the ads the game was free. It wont let me go past level 6, it says I have to at least pay 1.99. I was really disappointed. Update- Thank you for responding. I was trying to play free watching ads. I got to level 6 and it only showed me a screen that said purchasento okay and the amounts. Even though I clicked the button that should have showed me an ad. It was very frustrating. This isn't the first time I have had these issues with your game",
      "Just completed this game. Never lost interest as every level was different. This differs from other apps like this as in they have an actual storyline as well. Getton \"Allison\"and all at Hearts Hospital. Looking forward to the next part of the story..... P. S I have just one tiny weeny \"complaint\"- it became a little difficult to see everything as it was so small for me, although once I'd found my glasses, it was all good!!",
      "I don't normally leave reviews but I was a bit perturbed by that fact that after passing level 15, the game automatically restarted. I was enjoying making progress and was highly enthused as it was one of the best games I've played thus far. However, after it restarted I couldn't see myself doing everything again from scratch hence I decided to uninstall it as I was disappointed.",
      "This is the best doctor game i have ever played and I love the storyline and mini games! This is inspiring and captivating because I want to work in a hospital some day. I like how you can go around all the wards and even the cafe as you play fun mini games. The music is one of. My favorite parts of the game.. I love this game and I would suggest a feature where you can create yourself as a doctor character and make choices. I highly recommend and I can't wait for episode 3! :-)",
      "HM2 4 iPad has a version where ea lvl has 5 stars. Is there a 5 star / lvl version 4 the tablet? Lvl 13 (iPad) has become stuck after the 3rd star on replay 4 4 stars - I'm loath 2 delete & re-install in case I can't get it again. Also, there are no hamsters showing or squeaking in Emily's kitchen lvls yet there's a # 4 1."

And the amount of ads it's insane. I feel bad to give one star, as this game is still..saveable..that's why you get two. But really deserves one.",
      "Seriously I'll just say things that are wrong _pictures when they're talking make it look cheap when you put bandage on the cat or dog looks bad and misplaced just not the BEST game ever.....you did good*fine* though",
      "it has the potential to be a really good game. it would be nice if there was some research done into injuries animals get to put into the game. it would give it a more education element and give each pet a little more depth. the controls are ok, could be smoother but its not the worst. im sure kids would like this game although you would have to remove the adds. they pop up every 10 seconds. its a little glitchy but not unplayable. id say it was just that. playable.",
      "I think it has to many ads but other then that I love the game. Such a good game",
      "The description definitely is not what the game is like, the graphics are pretty bad and the controls are also pretty bad but, I like the effort and this game can definitely be something with better graphics and more animal options and better controls so I gave it 3 stars for motivation to make it better. Other than that, its pretty cool👍🏼🙃"

      "Why is the there a time limit? The buttons on the keyboard never click or tyoe once you press them and the instruments used never actually finish the job so its just time wasted. It seem like a good game but incouldnt even pass level one bc of the instruments they never did the job even if i did what it told me too. I do not recommend this game to anyome with bad phones with a weird touch screen issue and to anyone who is impatient bc this game takes a lot of time just to write in the patient.",

I guess I won't be paying to unlock the other apps we have dl'd either. We will sadly only be limited to the ones I had paid for back when my six year old was playing them. Too bad...",

      "There was some significant lag time but the overall service was really good. The wait time was less than an in-person doctor visit. The availability of doctors was also good, though as expected there are no specialists. The line for the doctor I selected was long, but there was an option to auto-connect to the first available physician. This was very helpful and greatly decreased wait time.",
      "This app is a joke. It will bounce you around then tell you the provider is offline and boot you after you tell it to find another physician sooner than the one you're waiting for. If you tell it you'll wait then you'll wait for at least 2 hours then be told the provider is offline. Either way you might as well send up smoke signals and hope for a response. 4 1/2 hours wasted on multiple attempts.",
      "Horrible app design. It will randomly bring you from the waiting room back to the login page while the app is open. If you switch to another app and back it brings you to the sign-in page, so you effectively loose your spot in line.",
      "Quick and easy. No need to go around sick people with just a migraine. The Doctor is very knowledgeable and listened to all I had to say. Very great experience.",
      "This works well for me. I've used it twice so far. The first time it was seamless. the second time was tonight the doctor didnt know someone was waiting to see her. Mistakes happen so I ended up waiting a little longer. Nbd. The visits are cheap I paid $120 at an urgent care without using insurance so this is a good deal as.long as you dont need to be seen in person. I would recommend it."

An update is essential, or this game will never become any better. Some people might think I am being a bit harsh with a one star review, but this game seriously needs help. If the developer is looking at this, please, please change the graphics and controls! It looks completely different to the pictures, which is clickbait.thanks",
      "Well I can't go to the next level,it just would not respond if I press next. I have internet but it would not work if I want an advert (I can't watch an ad) please fix the issue",
      "It's interesting. because You Can Do Stuff Like It's Real Life. And Also I like This Game to As well To because You Can Walk Realistically to And that You Can Pick Your Character In - Game. because You're My Favorite Game cuz🏆 You Are the Top! Anyone Like It Guy's??? Because Was This Game Made 50 years Ago? Because I Don't Know Do You Guys Know? I Mean It's Okay If You Don't Know ✨ Well that's All I Haft To Say About This Game Oh Yeah One More Thing You Are The Star Well Bye Everyone ☺️",
      "Who ever designed this game obviously doesn't know anything about dentistry. The instrument used to clean teeth are scalers and cavitron; not an periosteal elevator. That's used for extracting teeth; to separate the periodontal ligament from the tooth. The patient should have been numb when you started the restorations. You don't mix cement to put in amalgam. They don't even use that anymore. Do your research; or better yet go to the dentist.",
      "This game sucks.Whenever I tried to walk it took me to another room and it has ads in the middle when your taking care of your patient. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE STUPID GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

    "description":"Children's doctor - we all love when people around us smile. We become well and happy when someone on the street gives us a smile. But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. \r\nWe present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). \r\nIn this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets.\r\n \r\nYou have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful.\r\n \r\nDeveloping games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child. They help to develop fine motor skills, coordination of movements, visual perception, attentiveness and observation, will show the baby how to treat animals, take care of them.\r\n \r\nOur games for kids, such as a dentist, will teach them not only to treat their pets with love and care, but also to protect their own teeth, do not forget to clean them several times a day, because going to the dentist is not the most pleasant pastime.\r\n \r\nFor the purpose of comprehensive development of the child, we create applications and educational games for children that are aimed to help boys and girls develop basic motor and other skills, and also have fun, fun and useful to spend their free time.\r\n \r\nAll you need is to download games, install and start playing, and in the future your child can choose one of the most needed professions in the world - the dentist\r\n \r\nBe sure to visit our http://yovogames.com and also we are at:\r\nYoutube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZruadkJJTuD4Bgb1F6pa3A\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/YOVOstudio\r\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/yovogames",

There's one bug in the hippo level where it won't respond to action it's telling you to do, you have to work around it, but once you figure it out it's fine. The whole game is fun and i recommend",
      "my toddler likes this game. there is nothing educational about it, it's just fun. but he was using it and the toothbrush the game required him to use disappeared and the process he made was gone because we had to start over. but it's really not a big deal because it doesn't ssve progress any way.",

I let my daughter play games on the phone so I can do housework and she's not disturbing me but with this game (mind you without the adds) would be the greatest app) but because I'm getting disturbed every second I hate it",
      "My toddler loves it and always goes back to this game. Only thing is they need more characters to play with (there is only 4). Also, there are ads in every kids games that are free. This one has lesser ad pop ups than other games we have played.",

But the box you choose always has 1 diamond, which can be up to four, choose again, yep it's 1 diamond. So options pop up again choose box watch video you tap and of course its unresponsive, they just tease you, you never get next video,",

      "It's a great time waster, it's been well thought out and it is very good theme hospital upgrade. However, I seem to have a bug. I'll email aswell but receptions seem to stack up and people end up just hanging around the reception area until they die. I think this has occured since coming out of winter mode.",
      "Ok, this is a really fun game BUT #1 it's REALLY hard to progress without pouring real money into the game. Also there are some glitches such as I got the cafe thingy to help with people's hunger and thirst but no one will go into it, I can't staff it or anything, it's kind of sitting there useless and ppl want drink vending machines right next to it. The graphics are great and it's fun otherwise.",
      "Really good game but why is it still in Xmas mode? It's almost March!! UPDATE... Had some issues where I lost some stuff due to a server error. I emailed for assistance and nothing got resolved. Bored of it now. Uninstalled. UPDATE... In reply, you emailed me 1st March in response to my email. I replied with the info you asked for and then nothing happened. Just be honest please.",
      "Graphic is very good. Pace is too quick. Rooms, Utility, etc too pricey. Not balanced with income.Produce medicine takes time too long. I enjoyed it at first, but later not again because the gameplay are definitely not balance (high medicine demand, but slow produce medicine, pricey shop item&rooms but low income). So sad.",
      "I couldnt even get to play. Once i had to hire a handy man, the select button was not responding. I tried to uninstall then reinstall, but the same problem kept appearing😔 Update: support team reached out and fixed the problem. Currently playing with no issues."

And speaking of playing perfectly, I've lost 20 pills trying to do the blood pressure apparatus and just can't get it. There are no instructions on what to do.",

      "Good little game. I understand its not 100% accurate but it is still nice to a student studying paramedicine. If you could just add some more options for diagnosis to stop things getting confusing? For example, V-Tac is not V-fib, and PEA is not a diagnosable option even though it occurs in the game. Apart from that, maybe some more vitals taking options? Or maybe that comes later im the game. Anyway, good app, helps pass the time",
      "Educational, entertaining, and realistic. This game is one of a kind for sure, it's difficult, and requires actual medical knowledge, which is provided in the game. It's fun for people looking to gain knowledge, while having fun doing so. In further updates I would like to see, more medications and dilemmas, more realistic and complex character stories, add a female model to match when your patient is a female (this will allow you to actually connect with your patient, increasing the pressure)",
      "Kinda good but kind bad. I think. For the good points, 1. You do hv to know the basic biological knowledge to play the game, which makes me to study biology more (as a high school student) 2. It will test you if u read the passage or not (the “test” in the game is very funny) hahaa. But there is always something to be complained. 1. It's so messy during the gameplay, lots of control but no tutorial (actually is there are a tutorial or I skipped it?) And I don't really know the words. Hahaha",
      "Interesting idea but it gives too much information too soon too fast and too much at one time. All the same I enjoy information games and even though it is not intended to be a complete legal representation for a real life situation it does give information about how anatomy works. I would enjoy seeing future updates to this game",
      "Love the game its extremely satisfying to save a life how ever I agree with a few of the other reviews it's really slow u dont get enough money for the missions. On top of that it doesn't change much with each mission it's really repetitive. I've bought game dollars and still can't afford everything needed to progress faster. Also when u diagnose a patient it says that the diagnosis is wrong if u only select one injuries or not enough injuries I think maybe a partial score would be fair."

      "This game is not good I do not recommend. There are few levels, even though you were showed how to do the surgerys they walk you through every level, before you wipe the open wounds with the alcohol wipes and there is still blood, it looks like someone just took a red marker and started to draw on the \"victim\". Many more poor things with the game.",
      "The game is cool and all but there's only 11 levels/ operations , then the Game is over. And most of them are pretty basic like emergency room injuries.",
      "I've noticed in some \"surgeries\" a patient may experience heart failure which is when the heart valve grows weak enough it can either stop pumping blood to your lungs or stop pumping oxygenrich blood to the rest of your body, so then the game ask you to give cardiac arrest. From the research I have conducted I'm pretty sure your not supposed to stop the heart while it fails. Just some common knolwedge from a 12 year old. Whoever made this game obviously didn't do their homework.",
      "This game sucks. It starts off okay, but then it just keeps holding your hand through every level, telling you step by step how to do everything up until you finish the whole game 5 minutes later. It needs vast improvement. You should be able to pick the items you want to treat the patient with. And there are annoying advertisements after each 20 second surgery you complete. It needs much more development before it sees the light of day.",
      "This game was aight.But the nurse telling the doc wat to do & according to the story line the doc is one of the best surgeon around that area,this doesn't make any sense.oh I get,may be the doc is a junior intern ,like the best junior intern who needs help from a senior nurse 😂."

      "This app is terrible. It takes forever to generate an appointment, then will continuously tell you there is an error but not where the error generated from, leaving users to continuously try to re-enter information over and over with no success/ access to an appointment. I wish my company would return to Dr. On Demand, that app is easy and painless.",
      "I usually don't rate app, but this one is really ridiculous. It won't even let me log in, either using fingerprint or password, because it the app thinks that I'm not connected to the internet. If I'm not connected, why are all the apps on my phone working and online with no problem? My phone is connected, both on Wi-Fi, or data, but this joke of an app doesn't even recognize it. Please hire some real Android developers who know what they're doing.",
      "After attempting to create an account for 60 minutes due to issues with the system having issues verifying my insurance info or whatever, the app says it'll be over 2 hours to speak to a doctor. Yes Covid-19.. Delays delays. Still signing up sucked majorly. I tried the website, calling the 888 number, the walgreens app and finally the mdlive app to sign up. All options had issues.",
      "Was recommended to use the service by my insurance provider. Called them up, went thru registration, installed the app, confirmed the appointment wait under 15 minutes. 3 hours later STILL waiting. Spoke to a health service specialist at 2 hours who told me the next available time to schedule a video appointment; because thats the only way in my state to use the service, was 11 1/2 hours later! What a joke! I could have went to a walk in clinic. I'm done. Uninstalled- waste of time.",
      "I cant even discribe how wonderful this is! Ive had an on going issue for a little while now. Time and money is a struggle, I just used this for the 1st time and received the prescription ive been needing within 5 minutes. Im so thrilled. Im overjoyed and i have a sense of relief . Thank you so much"

PLUS THE TALKING OVEN IS CREEPY!!!! And the characters are flat and dont word, AND THERE ARE TOO MANY ADDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

      "I have used the teladoc app to make contact with the doctor several times. I find the app interface to be easy to use and clear. At one point, I had an issue with resetting my password. I called the number, and the representative there was very helpful. She gave me a new temporary password and helped me to reset my normal password. Thanks guys, for your quick, efficient, and effective app!",
      "I think they have something fundmentally wrong on how to creat a patient's profile. Every time I switch to another insurance plan, I have to set up everything again. The funny thing is they even lost my visit hostory. Why doesnt allow users update their new insurance plan? Why you need create the whole profile when somebody switch to a different plan? It doesnt make sense at all.",
      "This app was recommended to me by a co-worker. Said it was great and they usually respond within 15 minutes. I have been waiting for 3 1/2 hours....I can't go to my PCP, Urgent Care, or ER unless I am dying or \"have severe difficulty breathing\". So, I thought I would give Teladoc a try. I have been doing home care for 6 days now and not getting better. I guess I have to suffer longer and get worse in order to get help. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this app. 😷",
      "More of an issue with the service than the app. Requested appt, then kept getting texts and robocalls from \"SPAM likely\" number, saying \"The Doctor is ready to see you. Please enter the waiting room.\" App was already running and I was already in the waiting room, and had been all day. Message at the top said I was still in queue WAITING to see Doc. Only thing I see is my cam image. Nobody ever connected with me. Finally, 9 hrs later, get another call, answer, it cuts me off appt is cancelled!",
      "Doctor did not show up. If you signed up through United healthcare, there's no way to login the app itself. There is no way to reset the password or find out the username, because it requires a security question. And if you don't have a security question you have to call them. And if you call them, after they have you on hold, and hang up on you because they can't hear. After that experience two or three times, one-star review."

Foxfire1",
      "UPDATE: Cleared cache and problem was solved. Quick reply from developer. Thanks! Fun little game and I love that you aren't limited by \"energy\" as to how much you can play. I can handle short ads before playing the levels. Was great until I can't load level 25. Says it can't show me an ad because I'm not connected to internet (even though I am) or I need to wait until ad downloads but that doesn't happen.",
      "Really great story for a time management game.. not too hard, so really enjoyable. Unlike other similar game, this game doesnt put \"energy\" thing to play which is GREAT. I want to know more about what happen with allison and crew in the new hospital they are working.",
      "The X-ray machine doesn't click into place, please fix the ultra sound; it doesn't allow you to see trough the skin. You can't pass without it working properly. We care about you enough to report bugs because we like the game so much. If we don't like it we just uninstall it without report. Thank you for your creativity you share with us.",
      "When I first played this game there was a part that scared me but now I am going to be brave and going to give it another try and because Im ubsest with babies and there are some babies in this game. and I think you should maybe give it a try and if you don't want to than thats okay im not going to make you and im about to do a spoiler alert to. And the part that scared me was the part when they where doing Dr.Allison and her mom's surgery.but thats me so if you want than have fun."

Edit 2/22 Still haven't heard from customer support and it almost a month. They only responded here but not in my game.......I just responded again in the help and support section of the game....You respond quickly here base on my review but it's a month and no reply or fixing my game !!!Customer support is a joke. It's almost a month and still no reply or fix to my game.",
      "Great Game! Although its online. Love playing it when i have data. The only thing is geting the meds, some meds is hard to make and struggel to keep up with patients sickness. Other then that love this game",
      "Since the last update I cannot play advertisements to decrease the time I wait for cures. Also my bubble boy mini game doesn't always work. I was enjoying the game very much, now just a little frustrated 😕 please fix 😬",
      "The daily quest activities don't register when I do them so I'm losing out on rewards. Game is good however it's hard to cure patients when you don't have the room so end up waiting ages for the cash to build the right room.",
      "Great game runs well. But after 2 years and upgrade to honor 8x phone not supported. Tried to contact twice but still no fix."

      "It really works! I was skeptical at first and thought it was too good to be true. I was fighting a bladder infection which I get frequently so I know how they feel. I simply paid a fee of $30 (prices vary) and put in my symptoms and then spoke with a Doctor. He prescribed me an antibiotic and within an hour I was able to go pick it up at my pharmacy! I also used GoodRX and only had to pay $15 for my antibiotics which would have been way more! I definitely recommend this app!",
      "This is amazing. I had a bladder infection and needed antibiotics but with my work schedule and feeling yucky, I did not want to go to a walk in clinic. Hey Dictor came to the rescue, I registered in less than 2 min, paid 40$ with my HSA card, described my symptoms, and wrote a little explanation to the doctor. I didnt even have to call or video chat - within 3 hours I received a message that they sent an RX to my pharmacy. Amazing top notch service, I cannot thank you enough!",
      "I was initially skeptical of using the app and putting in my card and everything. Worried it might be a scam. But I did try it and loved how quick and efficient the doctors were at answering my questions. They were helpful and quick sending the prescription I needed to the pharmacy of my choice. Nice to use this when I'm just too busy to get to my primary. And it's not very expensive",
      "This is wonderful! It is very reasonably priced. The level of care combined with the pricing blows seeing a PCP or urgent care out of the water. I used Teledoc in the past for minor issues and I would definitely recommend this over Teledoc.",
      "Absolutely amazing. I woke up on a Saturday morning at 4am with a UTI. I was dreading having to wait until my urgent care opened so I began looking up alternatives and Hey Doctor popped up. So glad I did! I filled out all the info and submitted my request around 5am and before 6am my prescription was sent. I was so relieved! Awesome service."

      "Dr Tracy Wilson was very helpful and quickly assessed the symptoms that my seventeen year old was experiencing. She confirmed what i was thinking and eased both our minds. The app itself has some problems and it was hard to tell if certain functions were operating properly.",
      "This service was amazing! Super quick sign up like really quick. An NP takes initial info and respomses are immediate then doctor was chatting with me within 3 minutes or less and was very informative and offered me great advice regarding my issues and great steps to reach the goals of what i am trying to accomplish very easy and very quick best part was 7 day free trial to make sure you like the service before paying so why not try?! But i will certainly be permanentley joining for good! Best",
      "This app is very helpful! Instead of making those scary trips to the ER and paying $200 for a bandaid, I highly recommend this app. Set up your regular doctor appointments but save the trip and text a doctor online with your concerns and they will be more than happy to assist and point you in the right direction. My experience with this app and the doctors I have spoken to on it has helped me a lot. I wish I could meet them in person and make them my regular doctors.",
      "Couldn't ask question without having to give payment information. So much for the free trial.",
      "Best app ever! Never been so pleased each answer always answered best outcome always happy with results couldnt ask for a better app! 😊"
