      "Great app, however when ever you switch to desktop the actual document's layout is different. The whole purpose of the app is to have it on the go and add pictures from your phone. There are no pages in the app so when you move to the desktop version the layout is different. It needs to have the desktop features like showing references and pages.",
      "I love this app. I use it everyday to write, make lists, etc. The fact that multiple people can be on and edit a document at once is incredibly useful, especially for things like shopping lists and school notes. Unfortunately, the app can only open and functionally edit documents that are less than a certain word count. I've noticed it gets glitchy around 40,000 words. There's also less ability to format than on desktop and I've had some issues with the app crashing multiple times in succession.",
      "Very convenient app, but a lot is missing or hard to access, such as font and spellcheck. It would be nice if you could double-tap or tap and hold a word to bring up the spellcheck instead of going into the menu each time, or if you could choose what formatting elements to have above your keyboard.",
      "Everything is good about this app but I am only dissatisfied because whenever I want to paste some of my Writtings in a document and save it offline. The clipboard will not open, I download this app primarily for saving my projects for back up. When this is fixed, I might give this app a five star.",
      "Better and Lighter than Microsoft Word. It's automatic cloud saving helps a lot and the best feature of it is of Online Sharing and Online Edit. For example, if you share the link of this doc with someone, and turn on editing rights. They can edit the document live when you two are miles away."

      "Office is awesome. The subscription model is a bit of a deal breaker. I can't stand reoccurring payment plans and my plan is apparently going to end. So if office Uninstalls itself I'm switching to Linux. You buy a computer that works for a year then stops being functional is ridiculous. It feels condescending. You're company has billions in profit and I can't just buy the software and move on. I love your software and I hate your payment plans. But what do you care? You don't.",
      "I hate to complain, because it might just be the best Word Processing app out there. But, there are innumerable problems with the interface - especially manipulating/dragging the cursor for editing. Also there are periodic discrepancies in template formatting, indentions, margins and paragraph spacing. All in all though, it gets the job done. And, as I said, it probably is the best mobile word processor out there. I'm sure that with time and updating the devs will get all of that fixed.",
      "Wonderful!!! It's more than wonderful this software has been a dream of mine for over twenty years I was first using Microsoft 98 word and word weaver. I think that was the name of the product that I had used. in my office supply and tool store. It was a really a good product back then. It really promoted my thoughts and ideas into a reality. Thank You. Office 365 is where it's at \" a good product \"",
      "This app seems to do most of what a desktop version of Word does. The trick is to figuring out what all of the little icons mean to do what you need to do. For example, you can convert a table to text, but it took me a while to figure out that there was a conversion *arrow* that looks similar to a \"back\" arrow (or *undo* arrow) that was actually the convert icon. I don't know if that example made sense, but the point is that you can do a lot with this if you're willing to figure it out.",
      "The interface is very janky and has numerous problems of which I cannot name from the top of my head right now. Despite this it \"gets the job done\" but despite this for simple editing such as moving images/shapes and paragraph spacing and intergers tend to be very janky. But I haven't had it for long but these are my first impressions on mobile."

    "comments":[
      "This was a great app until most recent update(s). The layout has changed and it's more difficult to find the tool/option needed. Today I went to change fonts and clicked on the font button only to get a \"busy\" indicator. After 15 minutes it was still busy. So now I am limited to 1 font. The menu text is smaller and more difficult for me to see and the text icons, which were in color, are now a drab B&W. I'm totally unhappy with the new version and I'm glad I didn't go Pro version.",
      "This was my favorite office app. Not anymore. If i am going to pay for a subscription, I will migrate over to Microsoft. The functions are too limited in this app for all the adverts for free version. Very disappointed. After leaving this review I will be looking for a new office suite to use. This reminds me of what happened with the Peel remote app. I found new app to replace it, simple 1 time purchase and never looked at Peel again.",
      "Was a great app. Loved it. Was using it from past few years, but after the latest update it's become worse. Advertisement are forced upon on the user and the complete system hangs (esp. the app force opens the Amazon app & the system hangs). The only way out is to reboot the phone. It's happening to me very often and it's just irritating.",
      "It's great app, love it!! Been using it for almost four years now, and it has only improved. Don't mind some ads as I'm using great product for free. But recently the frequency and duration of ads has increased to the point of being an annoyance. Don't want to pass through intrusive ads every time I take a look at a document.",
      "With the latest update the app has some added feature like search in filter mode. But there might some bug in this feature because it won't search (or index) at all. And after hitting done, nothing happens. It also requires you to type \"exactly\" (upper or lower case) all characters. I hope this will be fixed on the next update."

      "The app is great, very comparable with Microsoft Word documents (print layout, differs). Basic package has a data limit. I had a problem with sync update in Polaris, thus prevented access to a document, via email sharing and the latest modified document in the wallet vanished. Polaris had imported an older version from my Download folder to the Inbox folder, and was unable to overwrite with the newer version in sync, thereafter. The solution was not to have two documents with the same File name.",
      "Polaris Office is great to have on my phone. I can see all my pdf s at the click of the proverbial 'button'. How I wish you would give me instructions how I can install it on my laptop.That way I could print off all that I had saved. I am a soon-to-be 70 year old 'computer-challenged' lady. Can you help me, please?",
      "The interface is the best, it has exactly the options you need. Purchasing ad free only removes ads from one device, you have to purchase for each device separately. Almost every time I save a document it asks to save in a new file rather than updating the current one. Sometimes when I delete characters the cursor moves forward in document and deletes other characters instead.",
      "Almost every time I press the space button it just goes back and deletes something that I wrote and puts some words taken from what I was writing when I pressed the space button. And that happens way too often! It's almost impossible to do anything with this problem, please fix it ASAP",
      "Excellent compatibility with Excel and Word. Very well adapted to the limitations of the smaaler screen. I have the free version with ads, and would like the fll version, but it seems to come with a monthly subscription only. Had there been a verrsion that I could buy for a lump payment I would buy it."

Also the paid versions offer syncing between PC & Android devices but only via USB & I'm not paying for that. (COME ON GUYS) it's the 21 century! the ads are all dodgy gambling (slot) type games which I also have a philosophical problem with so - relentless adds + USB only sync = no purchase. Sorry but 👎",

      "It describes itself as free but when you try to use it it wants money. Sure, it offers a free seven day trial, but i was looking for something that would help me create a PDF for free, truly free. Now if it would give me X number of documents free, without having to enter credit card info, i would be happy to try it and maybe end up subscribing later because i expect to be needing this type of software again.",
      "Unfortunately another dishonest application described as FREE, but that's a misnomer. Let's be clear, I have no problem with paying for a functioning application, but to date all this one has allowed is the installation of an advertising model. It has not been possible to create even one document for testing. A waste of time.",
      "This was very disappointing. Icons that would normally fulfill a specific function do not respond at all. The ads are constant and blinking. Help is not available. Just take notes and transfer to a regular computer for the formatting that this app promises but does not deliver.",
      "Sneaky little liars. Even reading through the description it won't tell you, but this is a glorified pdf viewer. Unless you sign up to the membership, it's completely useless - all phones come with a viewer for FREE. This describes that it can edit documents etc, and that the premium can also do such and such, but 99% of the description is for the premium only. Don't waste your time - there are dozens of apps that at least let you do a few free edits without asking for $50.",
      "I could not be happier😁! Microsoft Office is not compatible with my Samsung Notepad. I purchased a MS Office license without being advised it did not work on a Android platform. MS documents work seamlessly. This application is comparable to Office in all ways. I have not found any discernable differences between MS Office and OfficeSuite. I was a Beta user for MS Office back in the Dark ages when I was using a 3-button mouse."

It simply uses my virtual keyboard, but I can only search once for a word. (It does highlight all words but in a very long document, this is not very helpful.) There is no way to up Arrow or down arrow through a document to search for other occurrences of that word.

      "Excellent! What I really like about this app is its OCR functionality. You take a photo from your document and save it as pdf. Now you can search for a word within your document or highlight the text or anything else that you do on an OCR text. I just wish it had more options when exporting a file (Dropbox and Google Drive).",
      "The actual scanning process is great - makes excellent copies of documents. Someone then took this technology and gave it to a team of inbred monkeys to build an app with it. Crashes regularly, inexplicably took old photos from my phone and made them part of the albums it created, changing the dates they were tagged with. Better perhaps to use some freemium junk filled with ads than this mess.",
      "I got this to replace CamScanner but I'm pretty disappointed. So far it fails to produce very clear scanned copies and doesn't have much capacity to adjust the brightness or contrast. I took scans of several documents which looked fine on my phone, but when I emailed them to myself and printed, they were barely legible and looked like really bad copies. Also, I find it frustrating that it won't save as a pdf on the phone. I'm in the app store not looking for another replacement right now.",
      "I've enjoyed using the app, and the new interface and web capabilities are very nice. However there are some issues with the image to text feature, especially for text that appears in multiple columns, this doesn't convert well and the converted document usually comes out as a jumble of text. If this can be addressed I don't think there'll be any other problems with the app",
      "An imperfect software for capturing a book. It doesn't try to identify the page by line orientation, only by the edges it tries to determine and because of that it sometimes stretches the page incorrectly. It also gets stuck on one element of the page (a diagram or a photo, ignoring the text sections below and above) and sometimes it's hard to make it consider the whole page. I'm not a very handy person and holding a book with one hand and controling the phone with the other are not easy."

      "Amazing little app to scan any documents you need digitized. Much more convenient than having to head to a print office to use their scanner, and not as costly as buying a home scanner. I got the unlocked version after a few months of enjoying using the locked version - since I liked the app enough, and didn't want watermarks on my documents anymore.",
      "Power packed app for scanning, OCR, format conversion, editing & sharing of documents. No other app comes close to it. Also really easy to use. Cons: pricings are quite steep for casual users Update: where's the recycle bin? If one accidentally deleted a page, only a message pops up informing they'll be kept for 30 days but you can't even find how to restore",
      "Exceptional tool to manage and edit documents! A must for every literate. The options to share in any format and different sizes, import pictures from gallery or other documents, crop and customize scanned documents in a variety of available options makes it awesome. Looking forward to learning more features. There are ads when opening and closing the application that might irritate, but that's nothing compared to the services provided for free. Plus, one is free to purchase premium :)",
      "This app used to work fantastic but now it intentionally lower the quality so handwriting is no longer legible. That will not get me to buy the app. That will make me find a different app instead. Now I'll be spreading word-of-mouth about another app instead of yours. A lot of people have downloaded your app because I told him it was very good, you're welcome. Now you made a liar out of me by lowering the quality of the free app like morons. No more free advertising for you. Dumbasses.",
      "I've been using CamScanner for quite some time flawlessly. With recent update though, I have now two deal-breaking issues: 1) It takes ages for folders to show contents when clicked. Eventhough, those folders have been viewed millions of times before. 2) Documents do not get moved to specified folders when I try to move them. I can see the documents in the new folder right after moving process is completed. But when I check later, they're back again in old folder. Frustrating!"

Version 3.6.13 is a major release including support for footnotes and endnote viewing, hyperlinks in PDF Export and PPT, full screen reading mode, Dark Mode and x86 devices along with a large number of bugfixes.",
    "comments":[
      "Best mobile office suite because 1) it doesn't grow in size with each file I open unlike many other \"reputable\" mobile office suites... 2) it has all features that are supposed to be basic for any office suite (does what it's supposed to) It's truly smart. 3) app size is very good. 4) It's very fast. 5) NO ADS🥳. I'd have given 4.5 🌟 if Google play allowed it. The reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I wish you guys could work on the UI in the next update to give it a more modern feel.",
      "This app is smooth and fast, with a great simple interface (it shows the entire file name!! amazing), stable, and perfect for my general document viewer needs. The fact it's free of ads despite being free is another absolute plus. I wish it supported rtf format too, which is the only part that doesn't quite work for me, but otherwise absolute recommend.",
      "When I try to open a docx file in Google Drive, it keeps saying \"There was an error (4) opening the document\". I gave the app all permisions and account data, but unfortunately it can't get along with this particular cloud provider. Apart from that, the program is fine, no ads at all, which is a pleasant surprise for a free app.",
      "Love the app but cannot save to my SD card so 4 stars. No matter what type of file, I receive an \"error saving document\" message when saving to the card. If I switch to internal storage, saving works well. Note: Response from developer did not address lack of ability to save directly to SD card as indicated on their website.",
      "I want to love it. I really like the interface which uses a small screen well and seems logically layed out. however most of the time i open an existing doc created by this app, i can't edit it no matter what I do or tap and all the edit controls are greyed out. if this is a feature, it has left me confused and i'm a computer programmer of 35+ years. When it has worked on my Samsung tab 4, I've thought I found my mobile office solution. Love that it prints to my Brother network laser printer."

      "I have a persistent error that ruins the experience for me. Every time I try to sign a document, the app tries to download \"fill&sign\", which always result in the same error message : \"There was an error in starting Fill & Sign. Please try clearing the cache data of your PlayStore application\". Even with several cache clears and phone reboots, I still have the problem.",
      "I used to really like this app. Not that much since the latest update that messed up one of the features I enjoy the most : the Reading mode. It no longer operates properly. To my despair... Since my last review, absolutely nothing has been done to improve the Reading mode feature, which is really poor on my android smartphone compared to similar apps. Is there any way to improve the Reading mode feature?",
      "Auto-cloud forcing, Apple level frustrating! Stop forcing the F** cloud on us! It's not brilliant it should be an option! Files just cannot be saved locally apparently, only broadcast into the cloud. Re Reply: This is not just a reader, it's an editor & creator, these functions are cloud only. That is not optional. To say I don't have to use half the app is not optional. Allowing me to save privately to the device I'm using would be optional.",
      "Kinda blows my mind that you need to pay for a subscription just to change the color of your text from black to white. Maybe I just couldn't figure it out with the free version, but that should be a basic feature. Not paying $10 just to use the app once, maybe twice, to get a different text color. Unless someone can tell me how to do it in the free version, I give 1 star. Money grabbing scam from what I can see",
      "Absolutely brilliant for my purposes. I needed a simple reader for PDFs that synced between devices, and I was not disappointed by Adobe. Even just the free membership has all the beautiful features I need. //// EDIT 03/05/20: This app is terribly buggy now. It hangs when faced with large files and refuses to sync with the web so I can access my PDFs on my laptop. Uninstalling."

      "This is a great little app for keeping and organizing all the mounds and mounds of paperwork that seem to constantly overwhelm my life and home. The pro version is a 1 time fee and super reasonable (though I have been doing the free version for over a year now and still don't really need it). The clarity is superb and the UI simple and intuitive. Love an app that does what it says and does it well. Great job devs!",
      "I used to LOVE this app since it really is user-friendly and creates nice scans if you really just need a mobile scanner, but after the update I can't keep my free account. It is basically making it so you have to pay for the services. I get to the new screen to subscribe to an email list and get an error. I've tried several times to uninstall and reinstall and nothing has been working. Edit: Fixed the problem - they are super responsive and friendly!",
      "Absolutely terrible. Scanned 30 pages from my phone. Went to upload to my Google Drive and they are all lost. Waste of time. Finicky app. Spent an hour and a half trying it out after I've learned to use other scanning apps in a matter of minutes. Not sure why this was rated so high, but avoid the hype.",
      "Fantastic scanner app. I tried a lot before deciding which I was going to use, but firmly settled on this which has become my go-to app. I even upgraded to pro and I rarely do that unless an app proves worth it. Keep up the good work Devs (who are still actively developing the app which is always a good sign). 👍",
      "I truly wanna love this app, but it's... Missing feature somehow. Not able to delete page after save, Instead you have to delete the whole document and rescan it. It is so inconvenience! Also, while iOS is having Sanbot 9, we fellow Android user is having 7 instead.... So am sure we are missing out. Decent app but hardly recommend for productivity user."

      "The app is one of the best document saving apps, I've tested so far, although the app (in both free and paid versions) is missing some basic features like an \"address\" and a \"document type\" deletion function. In search for an answer I consulted the app's own Zendesk forum, where a user posted the question 11 months ago and has been left without answer until now. Therefore only 2 stars for now.",
      "Very good app! Works perfectly!",
      "Ich nutze Docutain nun ein paar Monate. Dabei ist das Prinzip des Handy basierten digitalisierens nicht unbedingt neu, aber mit Docutain geht das Ganze sehr effektiv und flott. Weiterhin werden Probleme umgehend mit neuen Updates behoben. Vielen Dank für den Service und weiter so!",
      "Quite good. Urgently needs Support for German Umlau üäö. I would assume other languages with similar letters have the same issue ? Improvents to make. Own categories are needed and also default ones to delete. If I hold the camera upside down, OCR brings garbage. It should be abe to recognize the layout of the document? A fancy function could be to attach GPS location and than lookup business on google and suggest it 👍 Anyway, thanks for a great free App!",

      "I have to say I've tried both this and the adobe sign app. Why isnt this all just one app? I really dont get it. I feel like you guys are so close to perfecting the digital signature but you make it unnecessarily complicated. Why cant I create a template with this app and then create new contracts based off of it? We cant be expected to create every field/form every time. This should all be one app. You need to hire someone to combine these apps simply/easily with a mobile only mentality.",
      "While it's a very useful app, it lacks a lot of features you would expect from an Adobe PDF software. For example it lacks support for pre-filled form data and highlighting. There's also some PDF that it can't open. Another important problem is that it doesn't properly persist filed-in information when switching apps, so if your phone is short on memory while you check something else, you might come back to a blank form.",
      "The app is easy to use but constantly gets in the way of itself. Needs more features and better zooming. It needs landscape mode. It needs more toggles. This app is just forcing you to use the main app that they have and spend money on it l. With that being said, this app does what it's supposed to.",
      "I wish I'd known about this app before! Very functional and great for filling out forms from font size control, signature feature to being able to fill out check boxes. You have control and it looks neat. I will be using this often, and can now not worry about having to pay and/or travel to print forms only to take a pic and/or scan them back to digital to send them.",
      "LOST ALL DATA! 30 min for filling a form, copy and paste is not possible and in general not easy to use! I switched screen a few time to find info on other apps, but the last time I came back to the app the form disappeared from the list and I can't find it anywhere! What a disappointment from Adobe."

      "Very user friendly. I can scan anything and crop it all to standard document size. I can edit any number of pages at will, even merging, separating, or reordering pages is an easy task. There's still a lot for me to learn using the app, but I really like it, and it's a really good app for beginners. Wish the update was free.",
      "Good scanner! Works good but I'm missing a few features. The most crucial one is probably that I'd like to be able to rearrange the pages after scanning multiple pages. It gets really annoying when you scan a bunch of papers and do not realize until you're done that you missed one, so then you have to start all over again to get them in order.",
      "Unable to FAX easily since getting rid of my landline. Tried this app and was going to FAX PDF with eFAX. Scans are not always clear with this app, even after brightening; camera is in control of app sometimes when you are trying to center your papers and it clicks without your consent. I just want to get some clear scans with least amount of hassle. Why do most apps suck so much even in 2020? Staples can FAX your papers, forget these apps.",
      "So far user-friendly and it's fast I hope us they improve the app we able to put things like copy write on the document and in putting our signature on document in any style we prefer. So far I like.",
      "Worked great before, now it pops up your camera no green outline box and auto photo, moving on to better app,, this was the best, now completely unusable for multiple doc scans."

      "I like the constant updates. And they come just when I'm having problems. The products are operating good. The issue is when you bring in your second account and it is an account with a different telecom company, mine is outlook, seems like there must be a better way for the network to understand you're the same person. That is my wish list, everything Gboard, Gmail, Assistant, work great, the assistant recognizes one me and two accounts with no problem.",
      "Everything was working fine for years, until latest update. The problem now is that I can't open PDF files. It's freezing and get a black screen. 12-03-2020 I have uninstalled the latest update and everything works fine. Installed again the latest update and nothing is working. I can not access Drive files and can not open PDF files. Please fix it. Thanks",
      "It was a nice app but recently the synchronization has been an issue. Now I open it then it crashes and says \"Synchronization error\". I have updated and still the same. I can not click on the link to access the link you sent me. Please sort this out urgently and I will change the rate to 5. Answer my comments with why this is happening so all people can see. Not privately. Still the same problem & now I open a new account & there no folders. When I try to delete an acc, says I need my admin....",
      "App was good at one time. It seems like the last year have been nothing but problems. It seems like the more you use it the glitchier it becomes. When using it in the first few minutes it might be fine then after a little while I will get duplicates of the same video which aren't really duplicates at all and if you delete them thinking it's a duplicate your actually deleting something else and it's probably something you really want to keep. Thank goodness the trash has never let me down.",
      "I love using Google drive to store a lot of PDFs and different files to access whenever I need them. Now there is a version management, that uploads a new version of a PDF whenever I just want to look up a page for one minute in Adobe Acrobat, which prevents me from opening a file for a couple of minutes and it KEEPS BREAKING THINGS! I have a dozen or so PDFs where I have to delete all the useless and corrupted versions (on PC, doesn't work on mobile) to even be able to open them again. Pls fix!"

      "I am sooo glad I found this app!!! It is super easy to use. It automatically opens up to allow you to get right to scanning. I love that you can clean up the image, like fill in a corner that has a piece of the background or erase creases. I had been putting images on a document and then saving it as a PDF, but the quality was not good, as I am sure you can imagine. I can now send professional scans. Thank you Adobe Scan!",
      "This App falls into 2nd place after CamScanner, which I've been using for several years.. This App does Everything that CamScanner does, and is (Free), the scan quality is as good as CamScanner. To get the same features in CamScanner you've got to get the paid version.. If I would of come across this App before CamScanner, I wouldn't have paid for CamScanner..",
      "Alright I take it back, they implemented a great share system similar to the Acrobat Reader app. My last preview is below. Congrats to the developers whole improved it, I hope I helped. Previous: [ Great scanning aweful sharing. 3 stars just because it has been like this a quite a while and it is pretty bad. ]",
      "I use this everyday for work. It is an easy, quick way to convert written documents into PDF.some features are a bit cumbersome, but considering the fact that I've never been able to create PDFs on the fly before, I'm not going to complain!",
      "So far, so good. This is my second time using this and it's so helpful. I no longer have to find a scanner, connect to internet, scan in my files to my email, and make sure all is good. This app captures exactly what I'm needing."

Super annoying since DocuSign converts Google Docs automatically. If you have more than one doc to send, you have to create a merged doc which is yet again an added step that slows down productivity.",

This is totally FRAUD. Kindly return back my money am requesting you.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, was because the forms I created were difficult to read and even after applying several of the filters, I could not make my documents easier to read. The filters I tried either made the text more blurry or darkened the document making it harder to read. If there were better filters or the ability to adjust the contrast and brightness as well as sharpness of my document I would give 5 stars.",

      "I'm not very happy with the app right now. I needed to type a letter which I did. First I couldn't find a way to set the margins. Second I could not tell when I came to the end of a page. I needed to print it. I saw where i needed to swipe the screen to find more options. It worked and I chose the print icon. The print preview showed the entire letter was not going to print on one page. I cancelled the print to go back and revamp. I swiped after the change. Lost the whole letter. Can't retrieve.",
      "This app is incredibly basic. I can't find any style options found in the desktop version, and table of contents does not work either. The biggest problem is its struggle with large documents. Typing anything in the middle of the document brings the app down to its knees, and any sentence written during that instance will fail to appear after a certain length (fast typers, you know what I'm talking about). The undo button is extremely inefficient as well, only doing one char at a time.",
      "It's very simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, unlike every other Android writing app, it doesn't auto-capitalize the first words of sentences. [Edit] Thanks for your reply. It's now 4 months later, though, and no change. [RE-edit for new reply] LOL! How long does it take to add a few lines of code that capitalize the next letter if it follows sentence-ending punctuation and a space? Do you need a consultant? I'm available! 😁 ⌨️ 🖥️",

      "This app is good at scanning for me to rate 4 out of 5, but if possible try as much as possible to minimize the capacity of it results. For instance if i turn my picture into pdf i need the range options of kilobytes(KB) or megabytes(MB) so that i can choose any range which is effective for me. Do you think if i need a pdf which has 1MB is it easy with this app? Your kind regard.",
      "AMAZING!!! I was just about to use the fax machine at the library (which would have cost almost 12.00!) when i remembered my friend using a phone scanner so i downloaded this app and WOW!!! It is sooooo easy to use and gives perfect scans. This is an excellent app in every way!! Love, love, love!",
      "This app is amazing! So easy to use! I just took pictures with my phone, imported the pictures to the app, (you can take them through the app, too), and then followed the extremely easy prompts. The app adjusted everything for me! And I saved and sent the newly converted documents. It was so easy!!! I'm so glad for this app!!! Thank you!!!",
      "Galaxy S8, Pie 9.0.0 - Clear Scan is an excellent app! Over the years I have tried a number of scanning apps and I just was not pleased with any of them. Clear Scan is lite on resources, simple to use and loaded with features. Every scan I take comes out perfect without any effort. After using the app for 20 minutes I upgraded to the Pro version to support development of this app. My thanks to the developer for an excellent full featured app that is easy to use! Job well done.",
      "The app is excellent. It puts a cropping frame around your photo. Since you can't see under your finger, it puts a magnifying glass next to your finger for precise placement when you move the corners. I have this on my phone and have used it many times away from home to capture documents, and at home when I don't want to mess with my scanner. Recently had to scan a big long brochure that would not have done well in my scanner. Highly recommend it."

I havent tried editing a doc yet but I will .I dont like the having to upload a private docx to open . Privacy would be a big issue. Had difficulty finding option to remove ads maybe google play want to display adverts. It better value than Microsoft however it need an option to read docx without upload",

      "No longer works for password protected ods files. I had an open office spreadsheet with a suffix of ods. This was my master password file so I had it password protected. This was downloaded onto my phone. I went to open it because I need to look up a password. It no longer works. I then went back to the original master password file, removed the password requirement, re-downloaded the file and then was able to open it successfully because it was no longer password protected. It used to work.",

      "I've been using this app for years. In my opinion this is the best app for scanning documents and exporting them in various files formats. I have used this on both IOS and Android and my opinion stays the same. For me, scanning documents every day and exporting them as .PDF files is a laborious process. Using turboscan has mitigated that and made this allot more easier. The UI is very easy to navigate. I have not run into any bugs for the past 7 or 8 years of me using this.",
      "I've been using this app for 9 months now, and I use it for checks, documents, scanning letters and notes from work, sheet music. It does a great job of creating high quality facsimiles. It's not going to give you a 100% HD replica of a printed document, but it is WONDERFUL for record keeping and document sharing. I highly recommend it.",
      "This app is great. I love that I can utilize it for my work. I tell others how easy it is to use & I get clients to download it to send me their documents. It's easy to scan, crop & send the scanned documents in various formats to anyone in my contact list .. directly from this app. It updates automatically ... I absolutely love this app!!",
      "It works great. Really like the way it processes the pictures. Two issues that make me look for alternatives, even after purchased that one: 1. Need to import multiply pictures to app from my gallery. Currently need to do that one by one. 2. After initially imported page to multipage document I cannot modify page any more, so crop and other options are available just once. I really need to process pages after have completed importing them.",
      "Excellent performance and affordability. It turns my phone into a portable, high quality scanner."

However, the option of downloading the vehicle insurance into the issued documents is not working. It keeps asking for the father's name field, which was never in the vehicle insurance paper. Please get this corrected.",

My all the documents is registered via Adhar number even this application and the policy of this fails. They're lucky they're getting even 1 Star from me, if in my possibilities I would rather give -100. Pathetic, awful, disgrace. Shut it down. It's only made for Delhi not for other regions."

The app I used to use has become loaded with bloatware, pop-ups and it takes way too long to get anything done. This app far exceeds them. I highly recommend Simple Scan and will do so with word-of-mouth as well.",
      "App is simple. Too many intrusive ads. Ads will pop out and make it difficult to look at or do anything. Instead of locking up more advanced features to paying customers, the developer appears to have decided to serve ads almost to the point that free version is unusable. It would be nice if the developer could keep the basic part of the app without ads popping out.",
      "To upload to Google drive you need to pay for premium. That's not a premium capability, that's just the act functioning as it's supposed to. Also don't shove your 5 star vote in my face. Also it turned my pdf black and white in a really grainy way. Better off just taking a picture and cropping it.",
      "Does exactly what it says. Plus it's still free unlike majority of all the other similar apps that started of free but now want to charge for the same service. So would rather use this app which does exactly the same as them but for free. Hopefully this won't start charging once it gets a loyal customer base.",
      "Ok, so I needed to store my documents on an SD card, therefore I had to purchase the premium version. $7.99AUD, not a lot but when you expect the premium version to be better than the normal free one and it's worse, per sé, useless, I get a wee bit ticked off. The dozen or so documents I had scanned on the free version have disappeared without a trace. I'm hoping for a refund but the money has probably disappeared too. DON'T BUY IT."

      "Love this apps to my bone. I use it everyday for documentation. So easy to crop from any presentation image and store it in the folder that you can label it right away. You can delete or keep the images without going to a different page. Unfortunately, I can't do backup all the images per folder, the way the folders are set in Notebloc. Also all images can't be backed up all together in one process. Sadly, this type of feature isn't available in the pro version. 🤔",

Yet, I'm just wondering why doesn't this App get newer update(s) since the last provided update on Oct, 6 2019 (v4.0.1 is the recent update available on my Play Store). • I heard some other countries had got the recent update (v4.1.0) -- Is the version an official update? A regular update for the markets around the world would be nice and I'll surely be very grateful for that. ツ • Thank You! • Pro User",
      "I needed a scanner app that wouldn't scam me like camscanner. A lot of the \"free\" scanner apps are subscription traps. Notebloc is a pdf scanner with no fluff. It's easy to use. It's rare to find an actual free scanner app with bulk scan, but Notebloc's got it. And to become a premium user is one simple payment.",
      "Simple, Practical and Functional I am using the Free Version for general and office purposes now for about six months. I could not fault it on a single point. Although user interface could be a little more improved. I have used many PDF Scanners before, but strongly recommend this one. Just Try It.",
      "I used to use a similar Samsung only app, and it took a few attempts to find one I was happy with having swapped phones to a Motorola model. This app works well, although it has taken me a little while to get used to it and I am still discovering things about it. I use it mainly to scan forms that I complete each week by hand, so I can email copies. Their are probably a few things I would like to see improved, so will try and take note and add these here to my review."

Most people look to make a quick edit.. just install edit and uninstall apps of the kind...",

      "Great app. I have been using One Drive for about 6 years. In the last 18 months I have had to monitor One Drive very closely as every 3 days or so it decides to dump a ton of my files into the recycle bin. So I have to restore all the files and be very careful whenever I empty the recycle been. I lost some pretty important files when this first started occurring. I used to trust the program 100%, but ever since this started occurring I have been keeping my eyes out for a convienent time to move.",
      "So pissed with this program. Thought it would be good to backup my photos from my phone and be able to get to them on my computer. It deleted all my photos from my phone, all folders I had my photos organized in are now gone and not on the app. Dates photos were taken has been changed. So i can't even find the photos I took a week ago because other photos are on the same date. Do not use unless you want you photos completely unorganized and lost to you when you don't have service.",
      "Somehow my laptop got wiped completely clean, and everything was gone. I was in a panic as you can imagine. I had to basically do a factory reset on my computer and make another account and so on. As I was going through and getting all the accounts that I could remember back up. One of them being Microsoft One Drive. It took it a little bit to gather everything. But thank God all of my documents, pictures, everything was in there!!!! OneDrive has been amazing!!!",
      "Good quick alternative for offline backups, with universally accessible features and contents. Recently found that there is a Dark Theme option as well. Thanks. Once it gave me 'Unusual Network Traffic...\" message, saying that my account may be blocked in 48 hours, although it didn't show which file was 'inappropriate' according to them. So don't rely on the Cloud too much. My account is active, but that message definitely upset me. I now type my Day Logs offline, and stick to offline backups.",
      "Its great, the 5GB storage is pushy. A hard stab forcing that monthly fee. Microsoft is focused all business and structure. Lacks Compation in the product's, a little slag in chartter water too. Great product's hands down, for corporate covered business styled living. Google offers more free, and affordible products. There data storage security well its just NOT sucure. Only secured with companies thru gsuite. The terms of agreement and privacy policy BS. Thats why im switching to Microsoft."

I like all your apps so that why i want them. Please i need you help , is it because of the apps version doesn't work with my watch or there is another reason.",

I am using it on TicWatch Pro and can only recommend it.  You have to pay 3eur or 1,50EUR (50per. discount) for full app that is really awesome. Negative reviews are from people that thinks that everything is for free on their 200+EUR smartwatches.",

Large formatted PDF documents are hard to read as font is not super clear. There are obviously a lot of screen size limitiations but the app works well however is is not that practical to view  large docs on a watch :)",

      "This app definitely gets the job done. May not be all flashy but it does exactly what I need it to do. I have yet to run into any issues. The most frustrating thing about it is probably having trouble capturing the image. Most of the time it's no problem, but every now and then it will take forever to get a quality scan. Overall, 4 stars. Worth it.",
      "Very practical app that will easily convert your documents- just beware that options are limited as to how you can share these documents after you've taken photos of them. If you want to be able to save them to your device, you'll have to pay for the locked features- although I've been able to make due with emailing my documents to myself as a workaround.",
      "This is a MUST HAVE app for both personal and for business that everyone should have. I LOVE IT. As a Realtor I no longer need to run back to the office to scan docs in order to send them to my clients. I am able to scan immediately where ever we are signing and clients really like and appreciate this type of service. This app has lots of great features. Thank you so much to the person or people that created this app that has made such a difference for my business.",
      "Whew! I \"think\" my search is over. Lot's of free useful setup features and lots of one time, under 5 buck, purchases. So far, it's underrated! Try it, then buy the extra features. You can live without them, but why, when the total package is so affordable.",
      "Amazing, useful, it is a game changer! I used this app for YEARS and I absolutely love it. Especially when you don't have an actual scanner. This app really makes your work look like a PDF document. BEST APP EVER! I recommended this app so MANY people, including family and they love it too! Honestly, it's even easier to use than an actual scanner and fax machine!"

My eyesight gets worse the longer the day wears on, so itd be great if I could manipulate the font to accommodate for that without having my entire phone's font have to change. If I make the phone text too large, it becomes a pain to read my menus. I'd love to give it 5 stars. Please include this feature!",
