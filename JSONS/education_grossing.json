      "Couldn't speak more highly of this program. The content & material it provides is undeniably the best on the market, while being fun & engaging. I've never had any technical difficulties. I bought the full personal package a couple years ago & recently recieved a free upgrade to access all languages! It was already more than worth the purchase so I am very grateful. If you actually want to start learning a language or brush up on your skills you won't regret the purchase!",
      "When I tried to do spanish it kept telling me I was doing it wrong. I personally took spanish classes and was looking for more help. I don't think this app is really good with its audio. When I try to speak into the audio its always says \"Please move to a quiet place and speak slower\". I usually speak fast so uhhh don't know what to do then.",
      "I also had the message \"SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG\" but after trying many things all I did was delete the app. Shut off my tablet. Waited 2 mins and turned it back on to reinstall and that solved the problem. Hopefully this helps others. The App version is actually very easy to use and learn. I'm satisfied.",
      "Very happy to have all languages available and grateful that they updated my purchase with it without me having to do anything. App is fun and easy to use and it checks for the accent which is the main thing. Excited to learn French and later Tagalog, Italian, Hebrew, and all the other languages I've been wanting to learn!",
      "I haven't used it much, but this is clearly not the typical language learning app I'm used to. I finished the first core lesson and didn't hear or see a single word in English, but I'm definitely more confident in what I've learned here than anywhere else. It's interesting, and in the best way. I can't wait to keep learning. :)"

      "The lessons are good but the servers of this app are non-existent. The video keeps on buffering after every 4 or 5 seconds even though others apps work smoothly with the same network connection. The same is true for the Udemy website. It becomes frustrating after a certain time and the excitement to learn vanishes. I kept waiting for an hour to watch a 16 minute lesson and wasn't able to complete it. It was either a problem with the lesson or the Udemy server. It keeps on buffering.",
      "Works great but facing problems while playing videos and opening pdf lessons of my course at times. The videos get stuck displaying a message telling me to play the videos from my computer instead. It isn't a connectivity issue. The pdfs simply refuse to open while the ones on my phone open as usual. Moreover, this app works well only on high speed connection. When connected to the WiFi the video playback speed drastically reduces. I hope the problems get resolved soon. Thank you Udemy",
      "Hello Udemy team, I have an issue regarding the screen resolution. I cannot watch the videos in full screen body ratio. The width of the videos are fixed to certain level. And we cannot even zoom. As you can see when I play a video in YouTube. I can get Full screen display ratio. It would be better user experience. If you update it to the full screen size ratio. and also great helpful for mobile user's. Please look into it and let me know. Thank you. Kind regards.",
      "Please can someone explain why my course downloading is not effective. Each time I try to download a new course, the downloading starts from a previous course that I've already completed before. Is there any way I can correct this? However I've been enjoying the use of this App, this download issue is my only challenge. Please assist.",
      "I like the app but there are a few glitches I am facing recently. They are, 1) Even after downloading the whole course I am unable to view it when my internet is turned off or my phone is in poor network zone. 2) Recently I have bought a new course but I am unable to make the course offline, the download button does not work. Hoping to hear on a resolution soon for you. Thanks & Regards, Kevin Rodrigues"

      "Very streamlined, a lot more detail than other brain training games. The games/challenges are brilliant,, it also tells you where you are most advanced. The only thing I would change is the yearly cost and make it monthly, I'm not currently working so can't afford the yearly cost in one go, so I have given the 7 day free trial a go, even in the further info about the app, it says that elevate offers a 14 day trial and I only wish that I could continue with it.",
      "So far so good, been playing for about a week. I'm enjoying the content, I like how its getting harder with improving scores and the graphics are really solid, it's a very attractive game and it appeals to my competitive spirit by mentioning how you scale with the community of players. It's a fun way to exercise brain muscles. I just purchased pro to help support the creators, and I honestly don't regret it .",
      "Excellent app, developers! My brain is getting better by the day. My language skills aren't bad, 'cause I train them for college all the time, but my math skills are really diamonds on the rough, so I'm polishing them most especially. Thank you for making this! I recommend it to anyone who needs to polish their cognitive skills. 👏👏👏",
      "great app. I would give it 5 star if there is a way to backup my progress. dont really understand the ranking system. my rankings in each game is much lower than my ranking in each skill (writing, speaking, reading and math). my skill rankings are too high and I suspect that could be because the app does not have enough users.",
      "I mostly like this app. Some of the sections are extremely frustrating because they just don't work correctly. Specifically, working with commas. The app doesn't recognize when or where you tap on your phone screen accurately. Since it works fine on other sections of the app, I feel sure it's the programming and not my phone."

You can't do a damn thing until you sign up for one free week and $7.99 a month after that which to be honest I wouldn't mind, IF I COULD CAST TO MY TV! BUT YOU CAN'T!!!! If I could cast, I'd get the subscription. Until then this app gets 0 stars from me. Complete waste",
      "What a scam. Payment method expired so after a couple months decided to cancel the subscription. Cancelled they a few days later updated payment methods for other apps. They then decided to reinstate my subscription for Noggin without permission. I'll never use this again.",
      "Nothing works. Every time I try to verify my email address be it on my phone, tablet or computer, I get an error. Not to mention many of the games won't launch. I'm sure if things were to work properly it could be a good service. Uninstalled",
      "The recent update has changed the entire layout. Its much more confusing now with games mixed in with the episodes. The names of episodes no longer show either. When you're done watching/playing be sure to close out of the app completely or the show moght start up/continue on its own several minutes later. This is especially creepy in the evening. I'm hoping for an update/fix soon otherwise we'll be cancelling our subscription.",

      "We LOVE EPIC! It helps us easily find books appropriate for my son's age as well as find books by themes that he is interested in. I love how some books are read to him while highlighting the words and how some are read for him to just listen to. It gives him fun access to books while we can't get out to the library during this virus for a VERY low price! He actually WANTS to read like 3 TIMES A DAY now! We have lots of books but I love letting him access books (appropriately) all on his own.",
      "Worked well on my phone initially, but on my tablet the start free trial option comes up no matter how many times I sign in, and also on my phone now. When I click this it tells me that its already activated and sends me back to sign in again. So, I can't access anything on my tablet or my phone, which was working earlier.",
      "Love the app but wish students could use at home. Also wish it was free for remote online learning and parents who choose to homeschool. Thank you! My students loved this site last year. Also wish it would extend to older grades as site is very easy to navigate. Sincerely Priscilla. Ps I just signed up for 1 month free and extra 30 day access for $7.99 . Ithought great time for grandkids to explore while most of us are at home during these trying times. Be safe my friends!",
      "I couldn't access to my account almost for a year. When i try to enter my account, there is some one month free page appears all the time. Now, i am really sick of it. This app charges $$ every month from my bank account. I sent email to support team, but i still haven't heard nothing from them. Also, i tried to unsubscribe on playstore, but it wasn't work . So, i don't want to spend my money on this useless app. Please, fix this problem.",
      "Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too."

      "Excellent app great structure. The structure is very repetitive though, I know what to expect as in it always starts with a few new phrases, then you have to type them, then it's the conversation followed by lots of information educating you about sentence structure. A massive room for improvement would be if I can practise what I have learned from the beginning. The review should bring more stuff from the beginning as it primarily consists of recent topics and not topics from a long time ago.",
      "This is ridiculous. I used this platform before and always loved it. Now it's not working. More specific the mic. Yes I already checked the mic itself, the app has permission to use the mic as well. Also no background noise. Still doesn't work. It just doesn't seem to record anything and says try again over and over again. I did not pay so I could not use the mic function! Usually I never write reviews but now I am actually mad. Not cool.",
      "The app is quite good but sometimes the chapter isn't finished even though I just did it (with correcting my mistakes). As well when you have to tap the right picture to the expression, at the beginning of a chapter, the app often freezes. I have to close the app and repeat the things.",
      "The only thing that stops this getting 5 is the inability to change the size of the text. I would like to make the words slightly larger to make it easier . Update 15th March 2020- Also the listen and complete is painful. In other parts of lessons when you press the sleaker button it says it slower and the press again it says normal speed but not in listen and complete. It needs to be the same.",
      "It's def a great app ,just by taking the first lesson I can tell I would learn the language fast with this app. The only downside is you have to buy a monthly subscription. The price is the reason I'm giving it 3 stars. Please consider lowering the cost so It can be more affordable and more people can have access to it."

Is there anything else I can try?",
      "Horrible! Why fix what wasn't broken? I have used Dojo for years. I have told everyone about it. Now that you have updated it, nothing works right. Yes, I uninstalled and reinstalled. I have signed out and in. Nothing is right. If I wanted my app to spin a blue circle for hours then this would get 5 stars. I need it to work regularly as my students depend on it and this new version is erratic at best.",
      "This app is an amazing tool to keeping in contact with your kids teachers. I was having a problem with my app, deleted it, reinstalled it, and even updated it (waited for an update) and still had problems. So I emailed Class Dojo and they helped me to get it working properly again! Thanks to Rachael with customer support!!!"

    "comments":[
      "It is a very good application but it doesn't bring things from q new dimension daily. Just the same thing over and increase in the level of difficulty but that might not necessarily be a bad thing because practicing a thing over and over again helps you improve and be better. It helps you organize your thoughts and concrete. I would recommend that you download it and not only that ensure you use the app daily, with time you would notice the improvement you have made.",
      "It's been a roller coaster ride, I've been on and off Lumosity over the years and every time I find my way back I slowly start to see improvement in certain aspects of my life. It makes me wonder what parts of game theory are mlinked into Lumosity. Furthermore, I'm grateful to the creators of Lumosity. I hope somehow it can become a standard test for middle school",
      "I give it a 3 instead of a 4 because there is a drawback. Yet, it is a great thinking game, as well as an enjoyable way to learn. The drawback is that unless you buy a \"monthly membership\", you are at their mercy on which games you can play. This limits you to the three they have chosen for the day. You have the option to replay the games of the day.",
      "Ive been playing for least 12 years, and I have had a premium subscription. I really do enjoy it I would recommend it as a way to pass the time, especially if you want to paly something more mentally enhancing than PVZ (Guilty!) It keeps my memory sharp and its odd to notice when it does work, but when it does, you know it. Disullision and Train of Thought is also a personal fave. If they would allow your insights and maybe show you where you need improvement for free users I would give it 5",
      "Love it but would find it even more fun, if the list of scores were dated...none could then investigate/retrace especially poor or excellent scoring days. Also, since word games are my favorites, I'd love to find out how more of those could be presented me on my training days as opposed to the simply visual brain gymnastics, that my eyes find quite difficult and tiring. THANKS!"

      "This was a gift. My husband knows how much I enjoy learning a little bit of everything, so this was such a perfect gift for me. I am absolutely enjoying this app! So far I've watched Gordon Ramsay, Sara Blakely and Jeff & Rich... They're all very informative and fun to watch. I totally recommend checking this app out. He got us both the year subscription and we both are enjoying it. I look forward to getting thru all the Mater Classes by the end of the year! Thank You!",
      "I like how the courses were filmed and it gave me the vibes of documentaries and friendly interviews. Having all of the sets up and the content was scaffolded and smoothly flowed. However, I would like to have more engaging interactions or the set of assignments or assignments feedback after each lesson or module.",
      "I love the content, but the actual app is pretty glitchy. Trying to resume a lesson often plays one 2-3 lessons back. It's something you learn to work with, but still, for content delivered by professionals and leaders of their respective industries, it'd be nice to watch it on a more polished app",
      "I have never written a review before but today I just had to. Masterclass is phenomenal, it's a phenomenal concept and its executed in a captivating and smooth way. It's incredible to be able to sit back, consume content and learn from the best of the best.",
      "I tried to use it. I signed up with Google and as soon as I was asked to get the pass I clicked not now, and now I'm on a limbo were I can't do anything other than go around courses previews. I tried logging out and in again, with no luck. Oh well."

      "This is the best app ever! It solves your homework problems for you and if it says show your work this app can show you step by step how the problem was done! It helps people better understand the problem. There is only one thing I don't like about this app. It doesn't solve long word problems. Please add it to were it answers long word problems. People who have troble in math should download this app!",
      "Almost like a TI-84 in your pocket but different. You have to give it certain commands to find the value you want, but don't let that turn you off. I only have a couple of complaints, like the fact that there's not an option to slide along a line or parabola and get the exact value of it at whatever x or y value on the graphs like Desmos. It also doesn't have an option to pull up a table. But everything else is pretty great and the things I mentioned might be included in the premium membership.",
      "Okay, so I do enjoy this calculator as it provides the answers to your equations almost instantly with almost all of the requirements you need. Though, I don't like the subscription in order to view the steps. And now, after the past couple years, they pushed it with an ad for every problem you send. That's absurd. I'm sure they wondered why they weren't gaining money from the subscription service, well forcing an ad down our throats for every problem doesn't fix the issue.",
      "when I ask it to do uniforms, I can't even do uniform, it's just a waste of time. I don't understand why people would even like this app, I thought it would actually be good, but yep, when you take the picture, it always says that it can't solve the math problem, cause this is it correct math problem, which is really dumb, as in this app, doesn't work for me, I don't know if it works for other people or other people are just reading the app for no reason, but certainly for me, this app is bad.",
      "Really efficient and accurate. I use this to double check my work because I sometimes miss a negative sign or miss a step. This has always been right and is always really fast. Helps out a great deal. Props to the developers!"

      "Content amazing! App needs upgrade. The summaries are spot on. At first I read the blinks of the books I actually read (top to bottom), only then I pulled the trigger to buy the one year premium. Love the contents. Saying that I subtract one star due to the app, to be more precise: the app struggles with syncing. 1. Abysmal sync between iOS and Android. 2. Once a book is read, you will never find it via search although the book has been downloaded and added to your library. library does not load",
      "Nice app. You often waste a lot of time by reading whole books, and the realise 50% appealed useful to you, or 40% was something important for you to learn etc With this app, you can read blinks first, then select those books that are the most relevant you you. I gave it only 4* because imo it is too expensive, I would say it is maybe worth 60-70% of the actual cost.",
      "Updated review : The support team quickly resolved the issue. Thank you Blinkist team. I love the app, I have suggested it to a couple of my friends. The UI is great, the content is also very informative. I have a suggestion however, I wish we could export the content to OneNote as well as Evernote. Old review :The app says \"please hang on tight until we update our local database\" and after sometime, it says \"to upgrade, you have to be connected to the internet\" whats wrong with the app.",
      "Wow, what a great app. Really interesting idea! The app promotes highly effective life-learning in a quick, efficient and simple way. So enjoyable for those that love to learn but cannot always dedicate hours and hours every week to doing so. Definitely give this a try. I couldn't imagine anyone not loving this one! The settings are very straightforward with uniquely-smart customization options.",
      "Blinklist is a great app for supplementing your walk, commute or workout routine with some snackable food for mind and soul. It is a great alternative to brain numbing social media or music play lists. If you prefer reading, Blinklist serves as a great intro to books and allows you filter content and make better decisions about buying the full version of the books."

And it took us a while (sorry about that!) but we’ve finally put our heads down, flipped it and reversed it.

      "I'm disappointed of the last update. Now I can't just swipe left side to see all my courses but I need to get the button on up, that's not so comfortable with tablet. And also I don't bug it is or not, but my courses now have all time streak. So I can't see did I or didn't enough progress for a day. For example I learned some words yesterday, and today I still have the streak, but I did nothing for it. Thank you, great app anyway. I hope it will be fixed.",
      "This app was so much better when I started. There used to be so many features that distinguished it from just another generic language app, but everything that made it particularly useful or engaging to me---accessibility of user-generated content/courses, overall course leaderboards, the cute alien mascot Ziggy that evolved as you progressed from one level to the next---all have been systematically removed. To top it off, with each new update the user interface design has gotten worse. Skip it.",
      "I decided I wanted to learn a third language and stumbled upon this app. I feel like the most essential part of it is that it gives you the literal translation of a phrase. I think that is the feature I have learned from the most. I used the trial and ended up getting the annual subscription as well. I use this app in conjunction with Duolingo and Drops and I feel like all three are giving me a well-rounded education. Overall I love Memrise.",
      "Great flashcard app with both user-made and official courses. There is a paid option but the app is 100% useable in the free version. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can no longer access user-made courses for the first time from the app. Instead, you have to go into the internet in your phone, search for a memrise course you want, then open it using the app. After that it can be accessed from the app at any time. It's not a big deal, but it is a bit annoying.",
      "Good app but... There's a bug! The app doesn't allow me to go more than the first level of each course without paying. It happens only when I use it on my phone, on the computer it works without problem and I'm able to go to the next stages of the course."

I know I can search it on chegg but I seem to get to the solution more effectively when I Google it to get to the right chegg solution. Now, I can't get into my account when I need it the most. I spend nearly $20 a month for this!! I'm so frustrated.",

You can change your password as many times as you like, but if you plan on using chegg on a computer and your phone expect to get banned.",
      "I paid for the app, never got access. Emailed chegg and they told ME to deal with it and figure it out, and also to give them banking information over an email which i did not want to do so I just hoped they would deal with it. Emailed them MULTIPLE times to resolve the issue, and they took regular payments anyway. I paid for 2 months of subscriptions and did not receive ANY HELP from this app, or the support staff. Shame on you, Chegg. I would give zero stars if I could."

      "Content wise pimsleur is great, I find it very fun and easy to learn with this method. Unfortunalty this app has some bugs, but the Web version still works very well. //for devs The main bug seems to occur mostly when the screen is off. It desyncs the duration bar(or wheel in the case of this app) making it slower, when you switch the screen on it then tries to catch up to where its supposed to be. But if you have finished the lesson it will crash when it reaches the 30 minute mark.",
      "Very easy to learn basics and learn how to apply them in conversations. Very useful and clear app with good examples and activities to quickly learn the language.",
      "Excellent content buggy app. Given other reviews I can see that the issue is not my phone, but the app itself. There's issues with it lagging when I choose options and there's an annoying time lag that prevents me from being able to pause the content until it catches up. The lag causes the lesson to freeze and get cut off which makes it super difficult to remain engaged with the lesson. I love the content and focus on pronunciation. Part of me wishes there were transcriptions of the lessons.",
      "Updated review: excellent content, frustrating non-native app experience. Pimsleur fixed some bugs like the time seek control, but the app is still laggy and unstable; I have to force-restart it multiple times per week. Volume ~50% too low compared to other apps. Frustrating, but worth it for the content. Still recommend to everyone. — May 31,2019 review: three stars. Excellent content, frustrating non-native app experience. [Bug report.] Frustrating, but absolutely worth it for the content.",
      "Very disappointed i bought fluency made easy by ikenna and through that started using this app. Laggy, non responsive, crashing, slow, annoying This is the first payed app I ever tried and it has exceeded my worst expectations by miles. Even going to tech support crashes the app. The program and method is amazing but this feels like they outsourced the development for a cheap price. Moto G4 - my phone"

      "I am absolutely happy with this app. It can identify any plant, tree, flower, or weed and very quickly. If it's a close call it will give several options to choose from letting your eye decide. It also let's you contribute your photos to the database of photos if they don't have many of that plant. It also tells a little about the plant where it lives best, best feeding and watering practices. I do recommend Picture This to identify plants you see around you every day.",
      "So far it's been a good app. Its 7 out of 10 times right when I take a rough picture, but honestly some of the plants I take pictures of I do it to try and trick it to see how it responds. Im a groundskeeper so honestly I would trust it if I had to give it a shot in the dark. I also like that if it doesn't know it I can suggest a name or ask. HOWEVER I do not recommend any app looking for edible versus poisonous plants, like some people will try to use this for.",
      "I kind of like the app at the start and was excited to use it.However, it cannot identify several of my plants and at times you still have to guess which one from the options and it makes me doubtful of the accuracy of this app. When I suggest a name esp for those I know of, it won't reflect the name, instead it reflects the very general one like 'hen and chicks'.I was not very happy and didn't want to suscribe but I missed to cancel before the 7th day and so yeah, I was automatically charged.😔",
      "Great app at identifying plants! I would give it 5 stars of it had a \"notes\" section for you to add other information you like to keep on hand. I use plants as herbal remedies, so if I had a place to write the benefits, ways to use it and their actions, I would change my 4 to a 5 asap!",
      "The app is NOT FREE at all 😡.After getting information about 2 plants,I was not able to get information aboutthe third plant onwards. The app everytime takes me to a page where I am asked to collect ID's. I collected .5 ID by watching an ad hoping I would get information about plants but in vain.So, what's the use of watching that ad if it doesn't solve my purpose ? I'm not going to pay.Is there any other way which solves my purpose otherwise I'll have to uninstall the app ?Kindly let me know"

      "I love this game. My 2,3 and even 5 year old LOVE it and are very engaged. For $8 a month is nothing. This app keeps them engaged and happy, laughing at the funny videos and bragging about new skills. Sounds crazy but it's great. MY ONLY COMPLAINT is the sticker games. You have to do it with your child for the best benefit. Sometimes the games won't go to the next level so we have to redo the entire area but it's honestly not a big deal because they're still having fun.",
      "I have been struggling to find something all my kids would enjoy (stubborn kinder, struggling 2nd grade reader, pre-k advanced reader, and 3rd grade doing good reader). This program has been wonderful for all of them! My stubborn kinder loves it and doesn't get bored and fight me about it, my struggling reader likes that it changes and isn't the same thing over and over again, and my older reader likes the stories!",
      "Homer is educational and fun for the children. For my little kids, it includes all areas of English: sounds, letters, books, and more. Homer then puts those building blocks in a way that makes sense to the kids. When I can't teach them, I can trust that Homer will do it right. My kids now request to use Homer on a regular basis. Plus, the price was right. Thanks Homer for putting this program out there for my children!",
      "I appreciate that this program offered a 1 month free trial. I had been interested but afraid to try. Now I see Homer is absolutely worth the monthly rate. My son loves electronics, of course. And I always try to limit them for all the behavior and health reasons pediatricians warm us about. This app lets my son play electronic games while building his kindergarten reading skills! This app has given us both something we want and we both enjoy it!",
      "Great app until the recent update. Crashed constantly, I tried uninstalling & reinstalling the application and still wouldn't load. Contacted service and they were great at resolving my issue in a timely matter. My daughter loves this app and is only 20 months and learned to identify letters and colors. Everyday she says a new word! Definitely worth every penny."

      "Good app. Only a few games are free but they are enough to give you a good challenge. The ads are a bit annoying when free but not enough to stop me enjoying the game as they are between games not during. I like the daily challenge which gives a selection of the available games and tracks your progress. If I wanted to pay for a brain training app I would probably go ahead with this one.",
      "I deleted it within like six minutes of downloading it from an ad. Did 5 generic puzzles and got results telling me where I stand with other people. Whether these are true I couldn't tell you, but I imagine that's one of the features making this app attractive - the potential of feeling evaluated. The funny thing about this app is you go through the initial set of puzzles, then it forces you to set reminders to play it, and then says you need to pay or wait a day to play again. I wasn't going to",
      "Will rate it 4. So far the game is ok. But I have a problem with \"Baggage Claim\". After playing the mini game, when you have to find the cities you memorized, the screen is a little bit too low, therefore I can only see four choices and I can't find the submit button. I will certainly give it a five if my problem is fixed",
      "Love this app. My only issue is with \"Baggage Claim\". For some reason the list of cities drops to the bottom of my screen and I can only ever see the top two options and am therefore limited to the number I can select that I remember. I know it's not meant to do this because the first time I ever played the \"mini game\" it functioned fine, but now does not. The list of cities to remember and the secondary task (alphabetizing, selecting the bag, and clicking the letters) always works fine.",
      "I love peak and have noticed some small changes with memory, concentration, and reflexes. My only complaint is, lately, Grow hasn't been working like before. I have to click a few buttons to get to keypad since it goes to numbers first and it doesn't type(even though my phone is indicating it is). Please fix that. Otherwise, I like it!! *Gboard helped!

      "The app is pretty darn similar to the website! The episode navigation and organization UI is a little bit clunky but it's a great start. I'm sure I'm not the first one to suggest this, but picture-in-picture popout player would be really awesome. Too often I need to tab out to another app, or I would simply prefer to listen only to audio and turn off my screen, but playback stops immediately. Overall nice work, keep it up!!",
      "My family is very happy I subscribed. Much better content than what's on TV these days. I would also love to see more math videos on number theory, graph theory, and numerical analysis. Some of the science content is a bit watered down, so it would be cool if you had different levels of content. I'll give the final 5th star when the chromecast icon remains visible after a video has started playing, instead of having to go back to the previous screen. That is my only minor criticism.",
      "It's glitchy, surely you're aiming to improve it? Hope so, as I like the service. Add to que is all over the place, some media added does not show up in que. App crashes & restarts. Why can't you control each episode? It's not too much to ask. Thanks though, just a bit of work to do!",
      "I love Curiosity Stream! I usually watch it on my TV, but it's nice to have it on the phone when I'm away. I always find surprises on Curiosity! I'll be looking for a subject, and tons of things will show up. It's an endless opportunity to expand my mind, and thanks to one of those surprises, I'm learning to juggle to improve my memory and concentration!",
      "Wonderful!!! A great diversity of programs. So no matter what you are interested in, Curiosity Stream most likely has something on it. It also seems as if they take great care to offer only things that hold validity. I would highly recommend this application if you are interested in broadening your scientific horizons, or to simply entertain yourself."

      "Quizlet is amazing! I use the free version, and still get everything I need out of Quizlet. Whether it's last-minute cramming or a study plan set weeks before a test, quizlet is a perfect tool. You can even include multiple languages, play games, use flashcards, and assess your skills. Teachers can use it for tests and quizzes too! Whether you're a student, teacher, or just a curious individual, get Quizlet and explore! Trust me😁",
      "I didn't know that flashcard apps were that advanced nowadays. I got the \"go\" premium membership to remove the ads, that's fair. Only complaint : The auto completion when creating sets is great, but the way it's made doesn't make much sense to me. I'm learning Russian vocabulary and the app picked that up very well, but as soon as I've written a Russian word it should suggest the English translation as a \"definition\" instead of suggesting the word I just typed.",
      "Needs improvement. Agree with the other comments. There needs to be a merge/split set option. Also, I like the scan document icon but only available when you first create the set then it disappears after you saved the set. Also, you can't delete the set from the folder on the app; and you can't shift the order of the cards by dragging it, it can only be done on the computer version but not the app.. Please also have an option to display which sets to display on the main page",
      "While reading the 1100 vocabulary book, I felt the need to somehow find a way to review the vocabularies I learn throughout the book for the future review (without having to carry the book with me!) And I'm happy that I found Quizlet! :) Easy to use and an awesome app to have and count on for learning languages.",
      "This app is the ultimate study guide. You can create multiple sets of cards. If a particular card stumps you every time you see it, click the star. You have the option later to study only the starred ones so you can concentrate on the things you need help with the most! Also, you can see similar questions & answers to what you're typing, allowing you to select those and save time. One suggestion would be to make finding & editing particular cards easier, instead of having to hunt thru the set."

      "I've been using this everyday for 8 days straight now. Same thing happens every time. It's good for about half hour or so and then it goes all glitchy and frozen . Not really impressed with it since I was billed for the whole year and it isn't even working right. I get the 'program not responding' message a lot. And a few times for a couple hours it doesn't even recognize it is hearing sound at all after working perfectly So you have to stop and try again either much later or the next day.",
      "sure it's a good app. I only have a few complaints about the premium membership. May I add, the majority of the lessons and songs in order to access them, you need the membership. I want to learn not pay money every month. Mabye if you made some changes then this rating would not be so bad. The five minute work outs? Yes they help. A little. I can predict that the premium membership is where they make most of their money. Most likely because most peopel want a full version. Thank you.",
      "This is a really good app for people who (like me) are new to piano and don't know it! But the reason why i gave it 4 stars are these reasons: 1. Practice mode. So if you mess up a song twice, practice mode turns on.. And i wish, that you get a option if you want it on.. like, a \"would you like to turn on practice mode\" option whenever you mess up two times. Cause that would really help! (P.s. the practice mode is just annoying me too much, so i had to write this)",
      "This is a good app, it really helped me learn the basic 5 notes but after you do all the basic courses you have to pay to do more. After i completeed the basic 5 courses it showed me a video saying I could now play any songs I wanted, well that's not true because I have to pay to play those supposeded songs I can now play. I would not recommend this app to anyone because you don't even get the full experience you want.",
      "I absolutely love this app I use it all the also if you have a subscription you can use if on multiple devices and create new accounts with the same subscription the best part is you can play millions of songs and always adding more!!! It's worth every penny and isn't very expensive my first day I was playing Ode to joy and it's like nothing you learn in the blink of an eye and I have so much fun no problems yet thank you JoyTunes for creating this amazing app!!!"

      "Unbelievably Brilliant. I love this app so much! I can't believe how much value you get from being a premium member. I use Skillshare daily. They have everything from serious study to just relaxing and enjoying the content. Skillshare is like YouTube on steroids minus the ads. Thanks for such a great idea love, love, love it. The only problem I have is that sometimes the video quality drops and I can't change it.",
      "BE CAREFUL when signing up. Luckily I reread everything before clicking OK, because it automatically sets you up for a yearly membership ($99) instead of monthly. The platform is great, the app not so good, but that bugs me because it feels like scamming. A lot of people don't check that, and might not want to subscribe for a whole year, but because of that trick you're making money off of people who aren't even using the platform. If your product is good, there's no need for shady practices.",
      "Best skills development and person to person learning platform. The app is easy to use and as functional as the desktop version. Learning with this platform is direct and interesting. Every tutor and teacher have their individual teaching style and intense knowledge of their subjects. Thank you SkillShare for bringing a new and improved way of learning to the world.",
      "I wanted to apply only for a month. But I was charged for the whole year. My subscription is till march 2021. I have unsubscribed as I thought I would be charged more. I have already paid for a year. Your website says, I can still have access till the period I have made payment. But I am unable to view any videos. This is so annoying.",
      "Near impossible to cancel subscription...going around in circles. I have followed their instructions. Usually when you delete an app - subscription stops. Not in this case. Made to be difficult. Avoid! Still trying to work out how."

      "I was a heavy user of the previous version of this app and it was great! I love The Great Courses Plus and the app was simple but effective. Now the new version, I'll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the \"Downloads\" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can't we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I'm downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing. Not a problem but annoying and looks unprofessional.",
      "I have a pro subscription. Superb courses and highly recommend the content. However the new app is so much worse than before. It hadn't improve my experience and the contrary. I am streaming via Google cast to my TV, the episodes are interrupted very often. The biggest problem is that the new background servuces drain the battery of my phone. It is not OK the work the whole day while I am not watching. When you look into the Android statistics it used 70% of the battery.",
      "Do yourself a favor and use the website instead of this app. The new web app is actually quite good, and the new android app basically provides a slower, glitchier, crashier, more battery-intensive version of the same experience. If you really need to download content to watch offline, you might be stuck with it; otherwise, don't bother.",
      "Although I have been using TGC for years on my computer, and love its content, I am really unhappy with the app. After the new update, it won't open at all in my Android phone and is very glitchy in my tablet. Please fix it. I was hoping to use it intensively in these difficult days we are house-bound in Europe, and feel so frustrated!",
      "The old app was bad, but this is worse. You don't have to go through as many screens to find a course, but screens are even slower to load. If I press pause, it often continues playing, and sometimes the app freezes. Once it kept playing until I powered down my phone. If it does pause, it often freezes when I press play. It loses my place in a lecture, and often resumes at a random point in a lecture I'd finished. Content is great, but they should leave app development to professionals."

      "(Japanese) It is worth buying. So far, I had only positive experiences with that app, great level progression, you won't be feeling like doing the same thing over and over again like on Duolingo, tasks are fun. Most of them are based on sentence building which is great. It has short story videos at the end of the lesson so you can hear actual language in use. I 100% recommend.",
      "Hey LingoDeer, I'm totally satisfied with your service of language teachings. Last time when I downloaded app, I felt it's too much boring for me. But after listening about app, reading feedbacks online, I just re-downloaded again. Well, it has been improved a lot till now. Thanks for making such an amazing app. Still it is very important and useful for everyone!😄😄😄",
      "Been using for a few weeks now, I bought tue multilingual pass and so far it's worth it. I'm learning Japanese and plan to also learn Korean later on. The activities are fun, easy and really help you memorize new phrases and vocabulary. I have used a few language apps before but I would say this is the best one I've used for learning Japanese.",
      "It easy enjoyable a first, but the more I progress through the lessons, the more bugs I encounter and the more the interface feels clunky and unfinished. The \"detailed tips\" have obvious mistakes. Learning Vietnamese from English, some questions are impossible to answer without knowing how to read Chinese, as it shows 4 images with Chinese characters to choose from. Most annoying is the clicking on those tiny letters to write answers, and too many more annoyances to list here. It's a shame.",
      "JAPANESE COURSE - I started to like the app, it had some fun ways to get you immersed... but then, the problems came. First, it makes you use hiragana on the keyboard translations where you should use katakana ('American' should NOT be written in Hiragana). Second, their stories throw you into hardcore Kanji before you even have your basic hiragana down and are discouraging. Lastly, a pay wall by the second lesson preventing you from exploring enough to see if you want to upgrade. Moving on."

      "This app is amazing! I just started and I learned so much within 15 mins. The interface for the app is quite easy to understand and deal with. It makes the user's learning experience an enjoyable one. This app would most definately be my first recommendation to anyone else that really wants to get serious learning the importance of coding and the benefits they can aquire from doing so. Kudos to the creators of this app it really is a great one.",
      "I love this app! I have only been using it for less than an hour and its amazing. Although I wish some of the pro features were free, I can always just use another app to practice on playground. This app has already taught me so much and it's very addicting. Before I know it, I will be a coding master! Thank you, Mimo :)",
      "It's a great app. I'm using it for game development (which is a pro course) and it helped me a lot. Gonna publish my game soon on this platform because of it ;) But I do hate how you can't write the code yourself. It gives you choices almost, but you never write the code yourself. You'll have to just observe and test on your own project. That's why I'm deducting a star.",
      "Mimo has excellent lessons and projects and competitions and streaks that guide your learning at your own pace but encourage you to maximize it. The pro version is worth the annual £20 as it allows further development of each section and the creative projects to show you what you can do with your skills. If you are not new to HTML, this might not be as useful, since you have to complete all the basics before getting on to anything difficult but it is a superb app for beginners!",
      "I'd more or less give a 3.5-3.75 stars, but I can't. The reason being I've noticed on some tasks it would leave out information. When I go to correct it with the new information I am given; after I've gotten it wrong. 50% of the time it would say I was right. 50% of the time it would say I'm wrong. Please add all information to your tasks."

      "This was AMAZING. But the last few updates aren't. -1 star for removing the tab system (should've brought it up before): now the calculator gets cleared when you leave it for the camera. It was fine the way it was before. -1 star for the ads. I know you guys need to make money, but this of all things is not the place to do it. If I'm sitting here trying to get my assignment in on time, the last thing I need is an ad to pop up, ruin my train of thought, potentially distract me, and waste my time.",
      "Whenever I try to use the app it crashes after about 3 to 4 minutes and it reboots making me start over. In the last minute before it crashes everything becomes very glitchy (when I try to scroll the screen shakes violently and it won't let me do anything then it crashes and reboots itself). I have tried everything to see if the glitch is a user error and it is not. Please fix this. It makes the app almost unusable.",
      "The app is amazing. Not only does it solve the equations etc but also explaines how we got to the result. It has a camera which is great so you dont have to write the long equations . The only reason i put a 4 is because they made a photomath premium which needs money so now it doesnt explain everything if you dont pay. Its sad cause now less people will keep the app because of the premium. Anyways i suggest it",
      "Don't use it, use another app. Since they got greedy and added \"premium\" (which is also way overpriced), it defeated the whole purpose of the app. It was supposed to help you understand math. Now everything is locked behind a paywall. Also, support is absolutely fake. They just Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V the answer (which is also a big sack of excrement)",
      "This app has been very reliable giving me helpful steps for every problem... up until they recently added a paywall making the app worthless unless you pay. What they should have done was let people DECIDE to pay for their new features instead of removing them altogether."

I can't stand it even if my child loves it. So sorry, no, 1 minute of trial was enough for me. I like homer app better as it has more individuality to it and lovely songs. And by the way, I can use basic trial version for free all the time not only 7 days.",

Received lame email what to do if paid with each method of payment but message said clearly to not to charge me. On 19/03 got receipt for $60 despite originally it meant to be $5 a month and I got charged even though I asked to cancel it few days before it wasn't done. Look at the comments, loads of people same!!!",
      "The games is great but it kept froze and stop working which have to close and reopen again, very dissapointed and cant get my refund despite i just paid and experience all this trouble on 1st day. Definitely wont continue my subscription and not worth paying the money",
      "Wayyyy too glitchy. Freezes constantly. Can't go even a couple minutes without getting stuck. Great idea, but too frustrating. Should be taken down until the technical issues are resolved.",
      "A mistake was made and we seem to have purchased the app. We have never even attempted to use the app other than the first day looking through it. It never worked on my device and now getting a refund is close to impossible. I was given a help link and nothing has ever come out of it. 60 dollars down the drain and no Support for the incompetent app or refund."

      "Straightforwardly, I prefer this app to simply piano by joytunes. I don't say that simply piano is bad, but flowkey is just much better to me. Flowkey provides a much better fundamental for beginners. Also, as I remember, unlike simply piano, I can skip lessons that I already know which is very convenient. I rate 4 stars since I have a problem with MIDI, whenever I plug in the MIDI cable, I hear no sound from either the phone or my organ. Can you guys fix it?",
      "This app is amazing. It has a great guide to learn the piano notes and songs. On the pace that you are comfortable with. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn piano. The only thing that bothers me a bit is that its a bit expensive. I think if it was a bit cheaper it would be accessible by more people. Another downside is that you cant technically download the sheet music. You can just view it and learn it online on the app. It would be good if you could download it though.",
      "Super buggy. Half the time during an exercise which is supposed to be waiting until the notes are played correctly it'll just goes on without me playing anything at all! Or if it's actually waiting for me it won't wait for me to play the second note when two of the same notes are supposed to be played sequentially. Just very unhappy I spent $120 on this.",
      "The constant pop-up to rate the app, even after paying for premium, is extremely annoying. The exercises repeat too many times with too many screen presses, taking hands off the keyboard. Courses are fairly limited. Fortunately I only subscribed for one month, but already regret the purchase",
      "I really wanted to learn how to read sheet music. And this app helped me so much. It starts with the basic and marginally raises the difficulty. Overall a great app."

    "comments":[
      "The distinction between free and paid content isn't clear enough (fixed) and, sometimes, an entire section within a lesson is subscription only. Also, developers should provide some sort of incentive for correcting other people's exercises (for example, for every 100 or 1000 corrections you get free Premium for a week or a month). Badgering people to pay can be annoying. At this point, I'd rather see third-party ads than pay for subscription.",
      "Good with room for improvement. I miss a pure grammar section, with explanations about structures and direct access to it (I had to get a book for that). Also, whenever you interrupt an exercise, you need to start from the beginning of the section, which isn't always bad. Compared to similar apps, on Busuu you have the chance to type some answers, good point. But it would be better if the exercises were more extensive, like \"translate this sentence into German\", prompting us to work harder.",
      "The cool thing about this app is it gives you a free test, according to which your language level is being evaluated. It is very interactive and integrated for all language levels in a unique way. The examples given (to illustrate the meaning of certain words) are not easy at all for beginners. I believe this is not bad, but rather it strengthens learners' background of the structure as well as the common expressions in a particular cultural based language.",
      "Really cool app. Nowadays i am using this app in order to learn the Spanish. The content is really interesting and attractive and the same time it is abounded with fun which is helpful for learners. Also the content is full of videos that helps to practise the listening skill by just watching them. Really gonna say thanks for the developers. Great job! Muy interesante.",
      "I'm loving it. I am also using other apps, but this one phrases questions and answers in a slightly different way than they do. That helps me remember the lesson and not just fluke an answer by process of elimination. The ability to send progress to native speakers for help and to help others with your own native language is a great touch. Would recommend."

It's easy to maneuver around and find what you're searching for. I enjoy the app more so than the website. My only slightly negative experience is when trying to swipe to the next chapter, or section, it takes a few tries to actually get it to swipe. Other than that I enjoy the app and it deserves the five star rating in my opinion.",

      "The best app to learn words! It has an easily recognised icons for every single words, pronounciation... Thank you! Ps: the only thing bugging me are notifications, they're so random! For example, I just did my 5 minutes and in half hour or 1h I can recieve a notif, that I forgot to practice or that my 5 minutes are waiting for me, when in reality there's zero seconds, cause I just did my practice. :-/",
      "Stunningly simple app for more visual learners and even tactile learners. Learning to read and write Japanese is so much easier with this app than many others due to the vibration feedback when you get a correct answered followed by a visual splash and audio playback of the right answer. Free version is 5 minutes for every 10 hours which is great to start and then sessions go to 15 minutes per session with infinite sessions at any time in premium. Great app, great value!",
      "I hope that in the collections tab it will still show the words in english alphabet not the english counterpart of a word. Sometimes i want to practice pronunciation and hearing it is not enough. I do 10mins a day so i write everything first then study later. Hope you can fix this even online dictionary doesnt show the word in english alphabet",
      "Hiya☺This app could be Sooo much better as a 'free' language learning app....if it offered MORE words within the alloted time...or simply make the alloted time to be able to learn new words SHORTER THAN 10 freekin hours.lol. otherwise my advise to anyone learning a new language to go on DUOLINGO INSTEAD as it so far i find is by far the BEST free language app. Sorry to the people that have made this app but the alloted time/amount of words are just not good enough compared to other apps.",
      "It's very convenient and educational !! You could tons of new languages and words in a day .. Only 5 mins a day and you will feel like you've learned a lot within those 5 mins .. It's really a must-have app especially for travelers.."

Maybe not for USA, but for a standard in my country it is 10x more than I would give for such app. For that money I can pay a real course which i could have benefit from. This app didnt prove me that it would give me enough for the money, and it is annoying when i have to give a billing method before I get a free trial.",
      "On the whole it's quite informative. But the exercises (and the explanations) quickly become frustrating. Figuratively speaking you're too often supposed to be able to accomplish a perfect double flip backwards after doing ten sit-ups. I'm often ranting... which isn't a sign of me having fun or learning anything new. I'm probably just a very dumb person.",
      "Nice realised concept, best app in brain teasers. Now become more casual: one daily task with article, the beginner difficulty compared to old concept(there were 3 levels, but only problems). No addictive features (bad ones), so that why model and support will go down, not efficient for market(what makes more unique)",
      "This app was pretty good. Until most recent update. Now it's cumbersome, counterintuitive and annoying. It was nice and clean with access to daily challenges, stats, etc. Most recent update feels like downgrade few years back.",
      "The app is okay. But even though I cancelled my subscription before the end of the free trial it charged me anyway! This is outrageous and a huge problem that will probably take more than a day to fix. I can't believe I was charged after canceling! That is unacceptable."

      "I'm following Justin's lessons on the website and downloaded the app to be able to practice songs. While this could be a great app, it works for 2 or 3 songs and then stops playing any for no apparent reason. The only way to get it going is by restarting the app. Combined with the excessively long loading time and the heavy battery drainage, the user experience is ruined. Can't enjoy the app as it is, will wait for a while for a possible fix, and failing that will stop my subscription.",
      "The first tutorial that really introduces guitar basics from scratch. As a totally new concept for me was the anchor finger and the convenience to use it! Brilliant advice!! I have finished the first unit and really liked the app so far. Now I suppose to pay to continue with it, which I most probably do. Now after three months I am slowly getting ready to the stage 7. Digital learning environment really rocks! I can recommend but it also requires patient folks, just like Jason says so often ;-)",
      "Justin has developed a fine thing here with some free lessons to try it out. I just decided to give the paid version a try after two months using the website and books. I really like the app play along part, it's way easier than the tabs in the beginner's song book. What is missing is the link between the website practice routines, which I really like including time and progress statistics, and this app. I want the time I spend on this app to be captured on the website stats. No more space...",
      "I love this app! The exercises take the tedium out of practicing chord changes. It's great to have so many practice songs. I'm making fast progress and really enjoying the process. Two months later: I am amazed at my progress in a short time. And now I am making use of all of the songbook features- learning the strumming and/or picking patterns for a song, adjusting the tempo, changing the accompaniment, and more. I definitely highly recommend this app.",
      "I've tried to learn guitar a number of times in the past. Started to think I was too old, but Justin has made it an easy and FUN experience! It doesn't take long to start to feel confident about your playing, which is the key to continued interest & learning! Thanks Justin! PS - I love eggs."

    "comments":[
      "This app is pretty good for vocabulary-building, but there could be a good deal more grammar instruction. You cannot achieve basic fluency in a language without having at least a basic understanding the grammar. That's where most of these types of language programs fall short, and Mondly is no exception. Also, the scoring system has much room for improvement. I wish I could give it a better rating, but the deficiencies make it kind of average.",
      "The user interface is smooth and easy to use, and it's rather full of features, but there are two issues I have... one is that the clues are sometimes off -- for instance, I clicked on the verb and it said it meant \"ask\" despite it saying the full sentence as having the verb \"bit\" instead. Secondly, I started with Korean and it will give the option to show the words romanized or in hangul, but it isn't teaching me hangul.",
      "Great app for learning! Microphone is a bit wonky and playback in conversations cuts off FAST. Other times it takes several tries saying the same thing the same way to get it to understand. Biggest issue now is that undisclosed to the members is that if you review any lesson (day, week, or month) more than 10 times you only receive ONE POINT instead of up to max number of points for that lesson. ONE STAR UNTIL ADJUSTED!!!!😡😡😡",
      "More than optimal at teaching language skills if the learner repeats phrases and words as they are taught, as well as writing down the conjugations (which are tappable, to a separate box) on a piece of paper. I know that may sound either drastically too much effort outside the app or too little effort by myself to wait for the application to move forward with lessons. The best way to learn is diversification so, here y'all go! 🙂 Have a good day.",
      "i bought the full version. The user interface is very easy and the app works well. it does not present enough challenge to really test your abilities. it could do with more tests that are challenging to really consolidate what you know Subsequently my subscription came up for renewal. There was no way to cancel or renew. I contacted support and got no response. This is unacceptable"

It is really easy to use and you can do a lot of things in this program, u can play a game and learn some words in that way, you can listen books and stories and see your results like how much words do you know. So ya if you want to learn language, or just some words, or just have fun by doing something interesting and not waisting your time by playing Minecraft. Go and download this app :3",

      "I really love this app. There are so many people to talk to and it is a safe environment! I docked off 3 stars because a lot of the time it will say I have no network, and so i have to force the app to stop, then re enter. This happens even when I do have network. It's frustrating to have to constantly exit and enter the app. If this problem was fixed, i would definitely give the other 3 starts. Other than that, this app is amazing!",
      "Today I was chatting with a lot of people but after a while the messages stopped being sent. I tried to close the app and make login again but nothing happened. In the end, I reinstalled the app. When I opened it, all my conversations were deleted and I still can't send any messages. I really like you fix the problem as soon as possible!",
      "It's the best app I heve ever used. You can meet new people and chat with them privetly if you want. Also, you can know the person you talk with better because his personal information already written in his/her profile. I actually have been using this app for 2 years. I met many people who are in my age. My English has improved increasingly day by day by talking with people in English. I would recommend you to downalod this app. Because it's worth from you to try it.",
      "I used to love this app a lot 5-6 years ago, and I was able to make a lot of friends online thanks to it. However, I don't like how the app now locks you to a specific language, something which wasn't the case before. For example, even though I was learning Japanese, I did have the opportunity to talk to people from Korea and elsewhere. I kinda miss that facility. HelloTalk, I hope you guys would be able to bring that feature back, as well as keeping it free and not making us pay for it. Cheers!",
      "At first it was a great app 4.5/5 stars, But now they began changing the native language of people according to their nationality, which is frustrating for people like me who have complicated backgrounds, otherwise it's a good app. I hope they fix it as soon as possible."

      "Great content for my 3 and 4yr olds to start learning. Unfortunately it let's let down by the fact that it regularly freezes on the 'loading' screens. Between every game we need to restart the app. We are using a brand new, high quality tablet so this shouldn't be the issue.",
      "My 2 and half year old loves this app. And has lots of great homework material for parent to do with the kids. But it seems to have a couple of problems some of the games will freeze or gets stuck on the loading page. Also I think it would be good if you had to hold the back button for a couple of seconds to exit a game.",
      "Everything is too small for a 3yo to press. My son gets so frustrated at all the \"game overs\" from pressing slightly off-target that he won't play certain games e.g. Word Grid. Not sure why when there is so much whitespace around the small box in the middle. Why not just fullscreen that area? Also one of the games in Lesson 1 seems far too hard. He's only just learning how to recognize \"m\" and the game requires him to match whole words with small, unclear pictures.",
      "Although I thought the educational content of this game was great, it requires too much manual dexterity. This, not the instruction, was the source of my child's frustration. Many of the interaction points were extremely small. A lot of the time, this was clearly an intentional design choice. There was a ton of blank space on the screen, so the designers could have easily made buttons larger. Maybe this game is okay on s tablet, but it is unusable for a small child on a phone.",
      "Can't get on the trial - no support. I subscribed to get on the trial period having heard good things. The app says I haven't subscribed and wont let us do anything. I've on multiple occasions tried to contact reading eggs, only once receiving a reply, to which they asked for more information. I sent the requested info but heard nothing more, not even to my follow up prompt email. Cancelled my subscription before the payments started. Subscribed a month ago and no idea what the app is like"

      "This app is so helpful. I was spinning my wheels trying to figure out how to organize pharmacology in my brain for an online class with no lectures. The reading is so detailed it is difficult to know where to focus. Picmonics cut to the heart of it.",
      "Picmonic has been an excellent resource for PA school. Several of my classmates started using it when they found out how it simplifies information. I wish they had more in depth anatomy courses and dissection photos."

      "I just downloaded this app this year, but it is by far one of my all time favourite apps. I've been able to stick to my read one book a day goal thanks to Headway. And these are not fiction or romance novels, these are powerful self development books that have the potential to change your life. Even without going Premium, I still get a great ton of value. I know I'm gushing at this point, but I absolutely love Headway. Thank you to the makers of this app, please keep it up. I love you! Cheers 🥂",
      "I couldn't wait to read more often whenever possible. On the bus, at home, any free time I had, I wanted to start reading on a daily basis. Then I found this app. It had everything I was looking for until I found out you weren't even able to read a full book without paying for a subscription. I was quite disappointed when I found out about the paywall behind even a single book. I personally believe this app could be majorly improved upon it's subscription.",
      "Found it useful and subscribed (discounted) BUT , amount debited on same day (NO 7 Day Trial) and more more importantly on day 3 I received a cancellation message. So is 50% off true or not genuine (?). And I sent a mail to google and Headway too, but no response yet 🙄. Was excited first but quite disappointed right now 🤐. Wish you respond and sort the issue.",
      "Dear Support, I am beyond disappointed by the fact that the app deducted the annual subscription fee immediately soon as i hit subscribe. Prior to that, the app mentioned that the first 1 week is free. I was planning on exploring the app for the first time before deciding to go for a 1 year subscription. I would like to be given the chance to check out the app before it deducts money from  my account. I would like my money back please.",
      "Great app but would be great if it's a monthly fee instead of annual. I was back in fourth with support to try to get the monthly payment instead of the yearly and did not get anywhere. My trial period ends tomorrow so I will just be cancelling. It is a really great concept but billing needs to be changed. Updated my review from 5 stars to 4. ***edited*** I finally paid and signed up. This is a great concept and I am enjoying it!"

      "A wonderfully built app. The graphics when zooming in on certain planets are great. The thought that was put into the sound effects was a nice touch. It's also, a great learning tool for teaching my son about the constellations, stars, planets and various meteors/asteroids. Although, I think he's more happy to be awake late at night to watch the night skies...",
      "Excellent app for the night sky, helps me keep my internal, mental ; with a \" 1956 model brain \" compass in perfect shape and function. I navigate with the north star on this side of the equator and of course the southern cross below it, and I learned that in the boy scouts in 1965 to get my first badge of tenderfoot. Ask a kid to do that now and I'm gonna bet that they don't have a clue exactly how to do it or what that means to guide by the stars. . right.",
      "I did love this app. It has helped me teach my son a good but about astronomy and the work is grand father and great grandfather did for NASA. I have say, its not working well on my new phone. The camera option isn't in the screen so I can't get it to tell me what I am looking at and it just will not auto orient like it does on my old phone. That is unfortunate. Not sure what exactly sure what is going with this new android.",
      "Fantastic app so far. Writing first impression now, will follow up after digging in to it more. I will say, I bought the full bundle on second night out. First night, only tried a couple minutes, didn't take my time. Second night I brought my reading glasses out (cough) and 'figured it all out'. I would give 10 stars if possible; this is exactly what I needed to give my kids an ooh and aah astronomy moment (3d constellation view). Will return later for update after more digging!",
      "I Really Love this app!! Being able to point my phone anywhere, even beneath my feet, and have everything mapped out for me, the stars, constellations, planets, etc., is Wonderful!! I also love the notifications I get that tell me about the different events that are currently happening! I have seen meteor showers that I Definitely would have missed otherwise, even in the city with \"light pollution\"! I don't even have the add ons that you can pay for on this app. This is worth the download!"

      "I purchased this app for my daughter. February a 2019 it is never works correctly. Every time we get on it only allows us to watch the free videos says that we don't have a subscription and that we need a new one. We have a subscription. In fact, I was just charged again for a subscription that I cannot use when I tried to cancel it. It says it won't cancel till next year. I'm very disappointed with baby first and with Google Play.",
      "BabyFirst puts BabyFirst FIRST! I haven't used the app yet however I've read review after review of mainly subscribed users & difficulty accessing subscription content after purchase. Yet, BabyFirst replies w/basically the same reply every time. Obviously it's an APP ISSUE, NOT a per user, case by case basis. It's easy to get money back. With my bank, when I pay for services I don't receive or not as described, I report to Google & dispute with my bank along with documentation to back it up.",
      "This app is garbage. We set up the free trial and planned to do the yearly subscription, but can't access any content. The app just goes in circles telling us to restore subscription, then asks us to pick a plan when I can see from my email that I have one. We're getting rid of our cable and had planned to use this for my 20 month old and 9 month old and now we can't.",
      "I guess it's ok. I just got it for my baby who loves Babyfirst TV but his favorite show seems to be Shushybye...and I do not see Shushybye on the app at all. I was hoping I could let him watch it while I took a shower. I tried the lullaby videos but he didn't seem to like them. Can you please put Shushybye on the app?",
      "You may technical support once you purchase it, or to clear the app data after your purchase. A side from some initial problems the technical support cleared up, the app is pretty good. My kid loves some of the show and it's worth the subscription fees for no commercials."

PURCHASE ONCE, USE FOR A CAREER!  PDG PROmote provides lifetime free updates.  Why should you have to pay for a new app every time the study guides are updated?  You don’t pay $0.99 for these apps.  You deserve lifetime updates.  We know that your promotion is important to you but that doesn’t give us the right to take advantage of it.  Should the Air Force resume testing for the SNCO ranks in the future, rest assured that we will include those ranks in the app too.\r\n\r\n2. OUR QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLY BETTER.  Many of our users have commented to us that our questions aren't as simplistic as other apps.  They make you think a little more. The actual exam seemed easier.  PDG PROmote provides TOTAL COVERAGE of the AFH 1 based study guides.\r\n\r\n3. OPTIMIZE YOUR LIMITED STUDY TIME.  You have a full-time job.  We know you need to get the most out of your limited study opportunities.  PDG PROmote makes it easy for you to maximize the effectiveness of your study sessions.

Our ability to extract important information and formulate great questions is second to none.  Our success comes from our ingenuity, our competence, our processes, our work ethic, and our attention to detail.  If we needed years and years of experience to master a document that you are being asked to master in mere months you probably wouldn’t want to use our app.\r\n\r\n5. INTUITIVE DESIGN.  PDG PROmote is simply the most intuitive and least frustrating AFH 1 study guide you will find.  Experience the difference a great designed app can make.\r\n\r\n6. AUDIO QUESTIONS.  Yes, we use synthetic audio and not a real human voice but we include it in the app for free.  It’s a popular feature that many of our users use on their drive to and from work.\r\n\r\n7. DON’T BE TRICKED INTO PAYING SKY HIGH PRICES!  You will be accused of selling yourself short.  Don’t believe it.  You will be asked to pay a small fortune for their \"experience\".  Just remind yourself that you are being tested on a handbook (AFH 1) dated 1 October 2019, not 1987.  You can easily find Airmen who have used our app and scored high.  THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.

If it gets me promoted, great, but I shouldn't have to pay for something that doesn't work properly and was so rushed that the wording of questions don't make sense.",
      "Great study material to get ready for the big test, some tie-in to other questions and sort of gives the answer for a previous question. Only gripe is that it's REALLY boring, hard for a young airman to docus and read through 20 questions to absorb the knowledge(hands-on leaenee and gamer). Also, I'm not a fan about how the answers are on the same side as the question; my eyes just can't help but read the answer first most of the time. And yes I tried using an answer cover.",
      "How many minutes before the app closes out. I'm trying to study all 2000+ questions in sequential order but if I take a break (while keeping my phone on).......it restarts from scratch. What kind of sense does that make. I was 200 something questions in and now have to restart. I want to only see new questions before seeing the ones I know and have answered",
      "Good questions, but it doesnt save any progress for tests. You better finish all 90 questions in one sit through or in an hour you'll have to start over.",
      "I can't seem to find anyway to get the audio to work. Besides that it seems pretty good."

      "Wonderful game. Very cute art style. The gameplay is fun and well worth the 4 bucks I spent on it. My kid plays it for a couple of days and then she redownloads it a couple of months later to play again and she's been doing this for 2 years now! :) Most importantly, there are no ads and no in-app purchases after you buy the game. Great job guys!",
      "i love this game but some time it does not work correctly but it stops if i don't play the game for a while. when i grow up i want to do hair so it is so fun to be able to paly this game! i wish though that there was more options when you do there hair and i wish there was more people in the game. i learned about this game form my friend and whenever i go to her house that is all i wanted to do. but in 2019 for christmas i got a touch screen computer and all i have done is play it! thank you!!!",
      "Great app is it's fun, you can desging boys or girls. There are accessories, outfits, and more. there are so many backdrops and they look so cool. There is barely any ads for me I had no ads yet. Only thing I would want to say that is bad is tieing hair it's really hard to tie hair up in ponytails or buns. You can also dye hair. If you like doing other people's hair you should get this app. You also can't get bored easily.",
      "I really like this game but you should make it where your pictures actually save to your device so you can look at them later. I wish it was easier to make the hair look like its up in a ponytail or bun. You should also add makeup and more girl outfits that are cute and to change the color of eyes and to dye eyebrows. If you add these things i will like this game more and rate 5 stars. So theres a lot of things you should add but its still a fun game to play and make hairstyles.",
      "Works perfectly, I have never had a problem with this app. It is very creative and cute! It has no ads or in app purchases. This app allows my imagination to roam, and is very stress reducing."

      "I am speechless... For the first time satisfied with an app from play store. Hats off to the creator, his creativity and the idea to create such a useful app. If you are determined to learn something new in the field of coding, it's definitely worth installing this SoloLearn. It's simply awesome and simple too... Even as a beginner I am not facing any issue or problem. The app has been designed very carefully and it has lots of great content. 👍👍👍👍👍👍",
      "Awesome app! 😊😊😊 Great experience. It's my first time trying to code and this is the only app that gives a full interface to practice code. The recorder function is great too. I get to show all my friends and family my reaction coding for the first time. Five stars and great app. Haven't even experienced any problems so far.",
      "Update: look at this generic cut-and-paste response from the developer; a laughable attempt to show they are \"listening\". LMAO Decent so far, except there is no option to buy to remove ads, just subscription to pro. This app is worth a one time purchase of $5 at best, and if it was, they'd get $5 from me, but because \"software as a service\" is a trash concept, they'll get zero.",
      "The app helps me learn a lot. Plus it is appealing to it's users due to its graphics and short texts/paragraphs for any topic. It gives important points to remember ,in the end, for every topic.This pushes you to go to the app everyday and once in the system,the daily practice can make you a good coder.",
      "This app is great for learning, practicing, and challenging yourself and others. It uses a very simple teaching method that is easy to comprehend and remember. I'm extremely thankful for SoloLearn and recommend it to anyone and everyone interested in information technology."

I like that I learn more than one sense or meaning of the same word like \"schon\" can mean \"at least\" as well as \"already\", for example. Once I realized some of the quiz questions are on snippets of video not necessarily whole sentences, then I was okay with the partial sentences.",
      "Oh my gods!!! I LOVE it!! They ask you in the beginning which level you are... (unlike that crappy Busuu 🤨) HUGE +++ That way if you aren't a beginner, you do not have to sit through elementary lessons! I jumped right in and started learning at my level! Lots of Kanji... NO Romaji!! (again... Unlike that craptastic busuu 👎🙄👎) Whooo Hooo! This one, FluentU... it is fantastic!!!😀👍😄👍",
      "I read an article that this app does not have a language learner lean on the crutch of translation, but so far using, it seems to incorporate translation into the learning process. I really want to learn a language without translating in my mind because this ultimately hinders the ability to truly become fluent",
      "Shows you how to say each kanji, which is really helpful. And the repetitions of the quiz are great to get you to remember.",
      "The app is not worth for the money you invest. Once your subscription ends, you won't be able to play with the words your have studied and paid for. For instance, you pay one year subscription and when it's due, goodbye to all vocabulary quizzes, flashcards and examples. Your words are still there, but you can't do much. I don't expect to be a free app, but for the content I've paid for, I want the full functionality active. I believe it's a legit request for a not cheap subscription."

      "Well, the activities are quite helpful. At first, when I started the game, I was quite slow and my average was way below other people my age. However, after I got used to the activities' speed and became more accurate in my answers, I've been seeing some changes in my mental capacity during my daily life. The app requires cash, no doubt, but its worth it if I can successfully bargain against others in business matters without being left speechless by a tongue twister from my colleagues.",
      "I think this is a very great app! It has helped me improve not just my mind but it has improved my life as well, because I am thinking more clearly, sharper, I'm able to remember things better than I did before. This has also helped me with focus, I have A.D.D. and I couldn't make it through a presentation without thinking of something completely different or just get distracted not even half way through and miss the rest of the presentation",
      "I was surprised to find how it truly helped after only a couple of levels. Very happy to have found this. At first I felt slow and sluggish in my responses then my brain started getting it quicker. My word recall (the reason I looked for a brain nudge in the first place,) has improved and is getting better after each session. Highly recommend this to, as Poirot says \"get those little grey cells working\"",
      "Good app. Great in combination with Lumosity. They are different enough from each other and are complementary. Only complaint is that sometimes the games are too easy, sometimes way too hard...ie. Game difficult could be slightly better balanced.",
      "I find the exercises stimulating. It is a while since I have needed to focus with any intensity. Certainly the cogs are beginning to move more freely. The tests are also showing how my short term memory has suffered and the exercises are slowly reversing the trend X"

The the payment went through but it's still asking me to pay. Please give me the access I paid for or a refund. I will have to file a claim if I don't receive a response. (1/5/20) - 1 Star Otsimo just responded this morning and fixed the problem. The premium subscription I paid for is now working. All good now. (1/6/20) - 5 Star",
      "I bought a year subscription as part of a cyber Monday deal. Immediately after that it's already pressuring me to get now an extra premium subscription with a supposed discount, when I said no it suggested a new discount that I should accept before 5 minutes to get it, timer with seconds included. I feel that my kid's condition is being monetized. I prefer MITA, I feel I ended with Otsimo not because of a clear advantage but because of the sensation of urge they created on me.",

      "I loved this when I first installed it. I planned on using it in my special ed classroom. The price was a little too much for me to spend on my own, so I planned on getting data with the free version to present to my school board to get funding, but then found out that you can only use the free version for 3 days and then it locks you out unless you buy the premium version. The tools are great, but not having a limited free version means I can't pitch it for funding, and I can't use the data."

      "This is a very good app. And it has my child very occupied. But she came to me because she can't continue after 3 or 4 games. And I don't live in the USA to have money to spend on a game. So now she likes the game but because it won't let her continue she is very sad. The parents who have the money won't understand or maybe they will. I'm disappointed",
      "Content is interesting indeed, but there are something not so good: 1. I cannot move back to the previous unit for my child to revise what he has seen. 2. The video (player) is unreasonably resource demanding. It makes some low-end devices extremely slow (can't respond to the home button even).",
      "I love it! My son loves the characters, and has learned many words in just one week. IT is easy to use and has many varied activities.",
      "Absolutely terrible with the amount of money they want and the amount of stuff you receive. For me the worth is £3 for the entire experience but they want a subscription of monthly £12 and use the old tactics of rate and invite friends. Definitely not appropriate for children. Horrible! I hate it! There are free apps of much better quality.",
      "I cannot take this no more when I first download this app they never ask me about my card information what they asked me it was about my baby's name and all, after four days later I check my online banking and found out they have taken $15. 99 I was pretty mad now I am trying To cancel everything isn't showing me where to cancel please do something about this."

    "title":"Japanese Kanji Study - 漢字学習",
    "description":"Kanji Study is my ongoing project that tries to be a helpful and easy-to-use tool for learning Japanese kanji. Study with flashcards, customizable quizzes and writing challenges. Each kanji has detailed information and many examples. The app provides a powerful search tool for looking up kanji by radicals, stroke count and more.

      "It's a supplement to your Japanese studies. This is everything you could ever need if you're really good at handling all the information. Otherwise, it makes a fantastic source for any deeper info on thousands of kanji. It's like putting a dictionary, thesaurus, studying/practice system, and a little more all in one app. This isn't to say it is a thesaurus, but it is in the sense that it contains multiple meanings for a word, from most common to least common definitions. In one word: THOROUGH.",
      "I've only just upgraded to the premium version and haven't checked it all out but this is a great app for learning kanji and keeping up with them all. Honestly, kanji have been a huge obstacle for me for a long time in progressing on my Japanese and having this app available for when I'm on the public transport or have a moment free is very helpful. The only downside is actually one of the apps assets - it's so rich with vocabulary that I find myself adding almost every word to \"favourites\"!",
      "As an English speaker who grew up speaking Japanese and learned kanji for the first time in Japanese public school, the learning options in this app feel more intuitive and informative than any other Japanese language study program I've used. The ability to make connections between meanings and pictograms is essential to understating the language, and is a far better learning tool than rote memorization. I especially appreciate being able to study radicals!",
      "Simply, an amazing app. Definitely worth the price for the upgrade, I would pay even more. It is a very important tool if you are serious about your kanji learning. It even includes statistics about your learning progress, both reading and writing. A lot of information on kanjis, deconstruction and more! I'm in love with this app! Thanks a lot for creating such a wonderful app.",
      "I cannot explain how much I appreciate this app. I used this when I was taking my Basic & Intermediate Japanese courses. Every week, there would be a new set of kanji & a test. So I used the app to study, memorize, and write. Passed all of my exams. When the final kanji exams came by I was prepared. I'm ranting but thank you I graduated w/a Japanese minor last year. The price is worth every penny."

      "I have to pay for it and can only do #1 without a payment out of 45 which is just, \"Are you excited for your drivers license?\". I can just get a free app that doesnt involve any payments of any kind. I saw this in an ad and thought it'd be cool since I'm working on getting my permit, but boy was I wrong cause I cant do anything without paying for 45 questions and then most likely not gonna use the app ever again. If it was free or had add on options that cost money that might be a better option!",
      "The app isn't really helpful from what I've experienced. Although it is amazing with explanations but constantly redoing levels to get \"points\" isn't worth the time nor the money. If your thinking of getting this app in my opinion scroll your other options before this one. There are other apps that give more or less of the same performance while allowing you to progress without the wait or money.",
      "I should've read the reviews before downloading, but I saw the ad on a game and thought \"why not do it for fun.\" And I signed up, took the first quiz, and realized I have to pay for the rest. Most 15-16 year olds are not going to pay for it, or their parents. They'll just go to a different app. I used a free one for my state and passed mt test on the first try. I didnt even use the book the DMV gave me. I feel this is a waste of money like the rest.",
      "Great, unique and useful tools, it really explains the theory, and gives a understandable but complex definition to all the terms. However the app claims to work without data or Wi-Fi, when you purchase it, but it doesn't work as well as it normally does with Wi-Fi, as it does not show pictures and diagrams that are relevant to the questions. Although this, the app is worth it.",
      "It's nice, but one question I disagreed with was \"Can you ever exceed the speed limit?\". In the state of minnesota you can exceed the speed limit by up to 10 MPH if the posted speed is above 55 MPH or on 2 lane highways. So the correct answer would be yes. Your question is not specific to what type on road side street, freeway or highway, so this question should be rewritten."

      "I discovered Originator Kids on YouTube for my child two years ago, and it is because of them that he is an advanced reader now, in kindergarten. I finally installed one of the apps and he is having a lot of fun doing everything himself. This is especially nice because he knows all the characters already after a long time of just watching the app being played on YouTube. I had a downloading issue, but it was solved right away. Everyone was exceptionally nice and helpful.",
      "Bought the app and it did not work right off the bat! I enabled storage permissions, tried reinstalling, etc-nothing helped. Once the letters of the word are put back in place it just goes to a blank screen instead of playing the animation associated with that word. My 4 year old is extremely disappointed and so am I for wasting money on an app that doesn't work!",
      "It's fixed! I finally got a email response and they helped me out. It would have been nice if they had a message when you purchase to make sure you stay on the app ( don't close the app out) also make sure that you don't have screensaver mode on. So leave the app open and no screensaver. Give it about 10 mins to download.",
      "Unfortunately in-app purchase is required to access full alphabet, this prevents use with Google Play Family Library meaning purchases can not be shared between multiple devices. If you have multiple kids and multiple devices you will likely find this simply too expensive. Have to admit the app itself is great and children seems to love it. Sincerely hope developer will reconsider functionality with family library, then I would be more comfortable to recommend to family & friends.",
      "My 4 yo autistic son who is non verbal loves this app. It allows him to drag and drop the letters and goes into a cute cartoon explaining the meaning of the word. My only complaint is that the words are way too advanced for him. I need him to learn words like happy and sad, or up and down. Instead it gives us words like portrait and demolish and instead of smelly, its odor. Basic words would be nice, or even the option for an expansion or add on that could include them."

Upon exploring the app more I tried clicking the free movies button and it oddly doesn't work, even though the rest of the app worked flawlessly. It would be great if this could be fixed so I can decide if I want to buy anything extra in the app.",
      "Ota really good for edication and small learning for kids and all ages besides adults of coures! BrainPOP jr is really good accept you really need to get rid of the log in and subscribe because my parents and I think its a little unessicery for an adicationel app!!",
      "You have to PAY money for most episodes it's so unfair because if you'll just want to watch a video about butterflies you either have to pay $3 per month or $7 per month I suggest don't download this cuz you can only watch certain it episodes and because the quizzes so hard like they say do you want to do the easy quiz or the hard quiz both of them AR hard so I don't know why they did that",
      "I really love this educational app because it is really easy to navigate and learn everything",
      "It helps you learn a lot of things like that multiplication, divison ,plus and more it is an amazing app"

There's no monthly option, no biweekly option, nothing. They lock everything behind that $50 subscription, you can't evwn find scholarships unless you pay; what's the point of having a free account, if everything's behind a pay wall??",

      "Nice and new, it is good to learn a little every day",
      "It's good app but there is just one thing. If you add some features it will be more useful like including some sentences as examples for the new words, identifying the words whether it's adj, verb, noun... Etc. Divide words into smaller units like suffex and prefix.",
      "Good apps, I tried it for ten minutes and saved eight words easily, for example(settings, pick up, garbage can, fitting room, vehicle gate, spinach, layoff and other word) only in ten minutes, thank a lot for your effort.",
      "Accept free days and cancel the same day because I didn't like it. They charged me anyway the $ 29, I canceled with my card and they charged it again as a recurring payment, people avoid problems don't try it."

      "This is the best language learning app I've used after trying about a dozen. It's fun to use. It has many ways of finding the things you want to learn with excessive repetition of things you don't want to focus on before unlocking the next lesson. You can study what you want when you want. I love the Innovative 101 language app!",
      "I really like the lesson organization. I especially like the focus on listening practice. Each lesson has a bit of vocab, grammar, and cultural background. On the other hand more than a few lessons have editting errors. Some voice actors are very hard to understand. E.g Some speak way too fast even during slow repetition while others speak in such a disjointed manner it's hard even for native speakers to understand what they're saying. No built-in support for flashcard review at present.",
      "The app isn't as in depth at the website, and it's arranged differently, it's a little confusing to switch between the two. But overall the lessons are very well thought out and helpful. They really help with the why and how where other app focus on memorization. The content is wonderful, but the app itself could integrate more features included on their site.",
      "The lessons are really well put together. They dont overload you (at least not in the beginner lessons) fun to listen to and great interaction with the listeners. Including the pdfs with extra content is also extremely helpful. Ive paid for premium. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars, is due to the app stopping audio for no apparent reason. I'll be listening to a lesson, and it will stop. I try to resume the audio and the app freezes. Just means I have to close and reopen again.",
      "Overall experience is excellent. And for absolute beginner it is a very good experience to learn a new language. Especially the method of teaching pronounciation basics. Because it is the most important part of learning any language. There is also a suggestion if you please add the subtitles in other languages also. So, a person can switch the subtitles for his/her native language and it will be easy for non english speakers to learn another desired language. Thanks"

      "Toca Boca is one of my favorite game development team. Seeing a free game that I haven't played before lit up my day. I think the game is great, but I have a couple problems. First off, some of the presets have makeup, and it's annoying when I don't want makeup on the character, considering I haven't bought the makeup pass. My other complaint is that when I was washing a character with long hair's hair, red lines would appear on their face. Other than these, great game and would reccommend!",
      "It's an overall fun game, but something I don't like is after I've done a person's hair, I obviously take a picture, like you're supposed to. I make sure in all the pictures the person is smiling, but when I go to put it in the like gallery part of the book, all the girls have an attitude on their face, even though in the picture they were smiling. Maybe this is a reach, but it just rubs me the wrong way.",
      "Good game and definitely best hairsalon gane of theirs yet. However I think it should come with the makeup set an not have to buy it. The game is pixely but I don't usally notice it. In my opion all the character look like girls. But if toca boca sees any of this my one real complaint is: why can't we dye their hair it was one of my favorite things from the last game so why can't we do it in this one? Overther than that great game.",
      "There's many things added to this game that I like. But I miss the randomized characters. And the packs are insanely expensive. Especially the make-up pack, when the game is advertising itself to finally have make-up? I couldn't even find the other tools at first because it didnt show that you slide up to get more drawers. Keeping it at 2 stars unless the scammy microtransactions are changed. Would have been better to sell it for 3.99 with everything unlocked like the other games are.",
      "Very good game but the packs are too expensive. This is a kids game so I don't see why the packs have to be so expensive. I understand you already made it free there should be a in app purchase but it's too expensive. Maybe lower the price a little. Not all parents wants to buy their kids these packs or games."

The app states that a mask won't keep you safe from catching the virus then states that if you have the virus wearing a mask will prevent you from transmitting it to others. I have not taken many quizzes so I can't say if they contain incorrect or confusing and misleading information or not. Please review the information posted in your app.",
      "It was so giltchy it wasnt even funny. During one of my youth group games, i was hitting the right answer, say the one on the circle, and it would say i was wrong. Or, if all the answers given were right, it would still say i was wrong. I might like doing these games for like reviews or something, but this was just bad.",
      "it's fun, but you cant add diffrent types of questions without having to pay! You used to be able to choose the quiz type. It would be nice if you didn't have to pay and true or false and regular questions get boring! I wish you could at least be able to choose the question type and/or color of choices without paying! Maybe you could only pay for things like change the music or draw the pictures! Maybe an ad, for example to make a quiz with premium features ?",

      "my students love this app they absolutely love playing it, it creates a great sense of competition, classroom, and fun! They actually learn you can pause and teach in between questions you can clarify answers it's a really excellent tool, I know that I will be purchasing the premium the next school year :-)"

      "My son LOVES this but there's a massive drawback during gameplay. During the number or the alphabet game my 2yr old son will hit the 'next' button EVERY time when he's scratching the picture & it switches before he's done, or accidentally pulls down the screen all together and it closes the game. It interrupts gameplay every time. If they could move the 'next' to the bottom left where it wouldn't be in the drawing zone and make it so you can't pull down menus in your phone, it might help.",
      "Purchased this for a year and it's not able to let me download videos. It comes up with a error. What kind of app are you advertising if it doesn't work. O would like a Refund",
      "I read the reviews but still downloaded the app because my son loves the show. Deleted the app 5 min later. You have to download each individual song and the free trial comes after you decide which plan to subscribe to. Might as well pay for YouTube Red and get instant access to the videos without ads.",
      "It's a good App little one likes it. My big issue with it is you can't use it on Multiple devices or add to Family library. When I'm not with him, mum can't play it for him. I gave 4stars and thought I better take one off."

I purchased 3mth in Sept and only needed use of it til Nov. to which was the month I passed my NCLEX. I was ask the date of my NCLEX when I purchased the 3mths, unaware after that I would be billed 😡. Since November I have been billed 19.99 for Nov. , Dec and again on the 23rd of Jan. 2020. BEWARE they will keep billing!!!",

      "This app has been great so far! I've been speaking with people in mixed English and Spanish. You can talk with, text, record messages for, and correct texts from people. If you're stuck at home, it's a wonderful way to spend your time and feel like you're not wasting it!",
      "I've been having a blast on this app! I've made friends pretty easily, and I chat with several on a daily/ every other day basis. I did get way too many messages at first, which made it hard to handle and figure out who was willing to use the app truly for language learning and not for flirting/short, meaningless conversation. However, after I googled forums and suggestions on how to alleviate this, (just by going offline) I've been able to manage my conversation partners much better. Great app!",
      "The app is great. Sadly, most users are not online for learning. I only get messages from men, and not really different from what I have received in dating apps. With rare exceptions, men do not reply when I propose a serious language exchange. Yes, we can eventually meet interesting people to date anywhere, but this should not be the main goal of this app. That's disappointing.",
      "A nice application to meet with new people in different countries. I'm am still trying to get used to the copy and paste feature. Sometimes when I press ctrl + v to paste something in the text window, it sometimes just types a \"v\" so I have to click and hold until the context menu displays in order to paste. Also it would be nice to be able to save the conversation thread as a txt or rtf file to review offline.",
      "I'd say it's mostly working at its best, but sometimes my inbox just won't refresh and I have to close the app and open it back so I'm able to see new messages. Right now I'm experiencing lag when trying to Sign in."

      "I installed plantsnap probably about a year ago. I've used it every now and again and I've tried to identify at least 30 different plants, some of which I knew, just to check how the app is processing. I was hoping it would identify the unknown plants for me, but the accuracy of the app is marginal. Tbh I'm not sure now if it ever identified a correct plant. Idea is great, but functionality is disappointing. Certainly not buying premium.",
      "A few years ago I installed PlantSnap while on vacation, to attempt to identify local flora. While my wife is very knowledgeable (her uncle was a botanist), I was on my own and wanted to find an app that would do the identification and installed PlantSnap. Unfortunately, PlantSnap was useless back then (lots of promises but no follow-through) and unfortunately it is still severely lacking, today. Recently, I was invited to reinstall it. I even paid for the premium/pro version. It still can't identify the same plant it could not identify years ago, eventhough it promises there are \"thousands of folks around the world\" working to identify it. Their app lacks lots of basic functionality (it won't let me pick photos from anywhere but the Camera folder on my Samsung Note10+ and is not a \"share to\" target from any other photo/graphic/image browsing app - i.e. Google Photos, QuickPic, Samsung Gallery, etc). No options to turn off notifications (I posted a few recent photos using their FEED process and got sooo many notifications/comments, my phone was dinging like crazy - had to force turn off the notification via Android app settings). I emailed them 2-weeks ago about these issues and their auto-reply said \"Your satisfaction as a PlantSnap customer is important to us, and we are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to help!\" I have yet to receive any response at all.",
      "Stupid app just keep downloading files and using up memory. Even if I selected a photo from gallery the camera is on while it's identifying the photo. It should be online identification why should I carry the full data pack if I'm using online anyway to identify? It will ask your Google id, Facebook id or email to register with the app to use it too. At that moment felt like it's goal is to spy on me.",
      "Garbage. You only get 10 attempts at an ID each day. I'm sure if you pay for the app, you'd get unlimited, BUT...my issue is that I have NEVER ONCE gotten an ACCURATE identification! I tried over the course of several days, all 10 attempts each day were wrong and still ate up 1 of the 10 attempts for the day.",
      "I really wanted to fall in love with this app, but I can't. As a test run, I took pictures of some of the most easily identifiable plants I have(creeping fig and a spider plant) and then app couldn't identify either. I had clear pictures in well-lit rooms as well."

      "So much potential! Love the activities in this app. I purchased it, so should have access to it all however certain parts don't work. Right now the beehive activity isn't working, the calendar wasn't working earlier. It fluctuates and disappointed my toddler when he get his special time to \"play\" on this app. Also it gets really slow and glitchy and I am using a brand new device that is updated. So a little disappointment, but wish it would always work!!",
      "My child seems to like the free parts, which leads me onto the low score - I select subscribe, but the screen darkens like its about to pay, but hangs and does nothing.... Tried a number of times.. But to no avail.",
      "Great app for kids education, very interesting games that join fun and eductation and what i like most is the many languages available, we're canadians so we at least like to have an app in french and english.",
      "Hum not a big fan of the purchase\\free trial so difficult to cancel still cant do it. Program I'm sure is great but said you could use free with adds app never allowed me to go it.",
      "Have to pay for most things and what's free is rubbish.Should say you have to pay for the app at the beginning before downloading it."

      "It was fun at first! But after playing for a while more, it got boring. I realised that unlocking all the elements took a shorter time (1h) than I had expected. Therefore, it wasn't as fun as I thought before I downloaded the game. It became boring as I didn't have anything else left to play. However, the game is interesting and engaging. I would like the game to last longer next time and not tell us how to unlock the other elements. I prefer to find out how to do so by myself.",
      "This game was fun! But it needs an update. Please add elements 119-172 , Custom elements and molecules. and boring bug fixes.",
      "Can you fix that if you refund it so it gives back the money that you spent on the game because my brother was playing on my phone and he uninstalled the game and I was sad so please fix that and I will buy this game and some other games by you guys too. : ) That's the reason I gave it 3 stars : ("

      "This is real feedback so take note. I'm slowly becoming less engaged using this app. After 2 weeks of use I've found I'm not able to easily revise the words I've learned. You could fix this by allowing the words to be hidden in the collections list. The app also really needs a flash card style mode. The Dojo is a pointless feature, it nearly never has optimised words to practice even after learning 175 words. Also, please fix the UI bug when clicking the words icon on the topics screen. Thanks",
      "Excellently designed in simple small bite size learning daily. When I'm ready to pay for the premium experience I know it'll be worth it! ONLY ONE ERROR so far in it, that is the number 80, for which the correct spelling is.... \"WALUMPU\" ..... And NOT \"Walumpo\" as on this app. (my wife's filipina and I Al O Googled the two spellings to confirm), so that needs putting right on an update sometime : -)",
      "Really good app, but i wish there wasnt a time limit of 5 mins and i dont want to pay for premium just to get unlimited time. Also, i think it would be good to teach beginners (like me) how to write sentences in tagalog",
      "It's great, you would think 5 minutes isnt much, but you actually learn quite a bit. Even if you have pretty bad memory, the app goes back a pot and backtracks until you're confident. Really good, highly recommend",

Also, it would be great if you could download videos to the app as opposed to on your device. Would make it much easier to watch a downloaded video and then do the associated exercises (similar to how Udemy does it)",
      "I used this app to learn basic programming to replace game apps. But recent update forces you to spend 10$ a month on this when it was previously free. Before it was free for the basics and you had to pay for intermediate and so on. I'm 36% through basic. Thanks for the teaser.",
      "One of the best app to learn Python and data scientist, because u learn it the fun way , examples are very well structured and illustrated, but I will recommend it for someone who has a little taste of programming.",
      "Very neat app 👍 I've been able to learn SQL in a very short time! Totally worth the money.",
      "Website is great but app not so. App only have option for practice not to learn. Even if you select learn it will take you to those small practice questions."

He jumps ahead to poke the numbers in the eye to wake them up but doesn't wait to hear them say example: 1+1=2 which I wish it did. Wish there was a little more to the game because my son always goes back to it, but gets bored pretty quick. After the puzzle is done, it could just move on to the next instead of having to push the next button. Wish there were age levels lesrning numbers to + is a big jump.",

      "Loving this app so far, what a brilliant idea! I have a suggestion..would love to be able to add images to the flashcards so that primary language can be avoided when possible. Using your native language teaches you to translate which is not the goal. This can be avoided by using images instead",
      "I decided to increase my rating to 4 star. I've found myself coming back to lingq as I really enjoy the running total of how many words you know, listening time etc. I truly believe you can go from 0 to fluent using lingq and I'm fully onboard with Steve's ideology. It loses one star as the interface is still quite clunky and there are still a few bugs.",
      "I could easily spend hours reading and listening to the material. I'm now finding vocabulary I've learned in a context with newer words where I can hear it. The reading isn't overwhelming so you can do some extensive reading and absorb more of the language.",
      "There is no better way to learn a language (truly) than by using LingQ. I have recommended it to so many people over the years, and if you are willing to give it am honest shot, than you will be surprised by the progress you can make.",
      "love the app, and the idea 🙂. One suggestion please is to make the pause button in the center and big enough . As a user I rely on it a lot and most of times I miss it in that corner. Thanks!"

      "Hi i like this game because of the secret hideout and the hospital stuff but i wish something cool happened when you find and put all the sloths inside the tank i was very dissappointed when nothing happened because i thought something would happen. I thought you could actually have a character have a baby in this game like give birth but you just change the clothes to make it look not pregnant and then pick up a baby. 😑",
      "Make it possible to cure sick patients in the app. The app is a great for kids going through the hospital system or kids who experienced hospital stays. The adult version allows the player to make patients sick, but the kid version does not, so it's less effective than it could be for kids who use the app to come to terms with their experience. Letting kids who have been through the hospital system play the adult version can traumatize due to the inability to cure patients once they're sick.",
      "I love this game!! Amazing for kids and teens. This game makes you go from bored to happy! You can operate on people, get cured and its like a real hospital. 5 stars!!!",
      "My children love the Toca games and asked for this one. Unfortunately I can't seem to add it to Family Library which is disappointing as it means I've bought it on my phone but they can't play it on their tablets. All other Toca games have added successfully.",
      "It was a good game but I recommend not getting it because it's just a hospital and no homes and nothing?? So it was an ok games, but there is just no homes and no park there was no way you could leave.. So yeah. I don't recommend this if you get bored easily."

My daughter was having trouble early in the year, so her teacher recommended using Splash Math to practice at home. When she finished the school year, she was one of the best in the class!

      "Hi there! This is a really great app to learn French. I downloaded it today and it worked fine until i started on my daily lesson. It wouldn't open although it says that the daily lesson is ready. It would just keep on loading for forever. A pretty annoying bug and hope you can do something about it. Thank you!",
      "I've used different language apps before and this is the easiest one to learn with. I can go as fast or as slow as I want. I can repeat the recorded word or phrase over and over so I get the pronunciation correct before moving on. Some of these apps move way to fast which makes the content easier to forget and harder to pronounce correctly. This app is just my pace. Great app!",
      "At first I thought that it is a good app (Everything was good) but , after when I have completed one lesson and moving to the next lesson 'chatbot' it was asking money to unlock , I could not afford money so can't we learn ! I am sorry it's only for those who can afford money! I am not that much happy for this app. Needs improvement",
      "Seems like a great app to recall and refresh stuff already learned. But it has a problem on my device attempting to use the mic. It tells me to tap and hold to use but never really connects. Never activates the mic no matter how long I press it. And then it begins to force close on me. That kind of sucks. Update. Not free at all. Functions stop quickly without pay. Use Duolingo te really learn for free. To answer your response, it won't be necessary. I'm using an actual free app. See above.",
      "Its a really good app for beginners like myself because of the repetition, but for some reason the app keeps glitching and the audio stops working for me after a few minutes of using the app. And sadly when it does this you have to exit the lesson and restart, which is really annoying. If that bug gets fixed it would be really good."

      "I find this app very good, the constellation arts are accurate, and it also provides information on stars. Only problem I found is, it doesn't have images of objects other than stars and planets in the information section. For example, Andromeda and Sombrero galaxy. This information is helpful when I'm stargazing through a telescope and need to find these objects. Also the angle of view of the sky is very low. Most of the time, I can't see a complete constellation in one screen.",
      "Love it! Big help in locating specific stars, planets, constellations, meteor showers, you name it. Beats the heck out of trying to identify things using just a book. When I got my current phone, I installed quite a few astronomy apps and tried them all, thinking I'd keep the top three and use all three for maximum information and different perspectives. After a few days, I found myself using this app exclusively. Don't need anything else... Just make sure you calibrate it right.",
      "Each time I get a new phone, I always try at least two other, new to me, sky map apps, I always come back to this one. It's easy to use. Their screen is stable making it essy to mark the object of interest. There isn't clutter all over the screen. All the information needed is right on the screen. I love this app and it's worth the upgrade. A solid five star app.",
      "Still not fixed. I have my location on! I jave calibrated as they said. This app would be great IF it said I was pointing in the right direction. i am pointing north and it thinks im between south and south east. Please fix this! I hoped buying this app would make it more accurate but nope. I shouldnt have bought this. Terrible with proper direction.",
      "Yesterday I was at my friend's house, and we were discussing if he'd have sun on his balcony during the summer. With this app I turned back the time to June, found the sun and showed him the trajectory with the AR view. He was stunned. I love this application, it allows me to explore the universe and inspire others. The design is minimalist, yet flexible and full of useful features. I've tried several similar applications, but this one is my go-to ❤️"

      "Great App! Works well with the web client and is fairly faster than it. The largest problem, that may just be me, is that whenever I use it I feel like we're still in the 1990s. The app developers made no attempt to create a clean User Experience for us. And even though when it was made, it WAS considered clean, they're neglegent to update it. I could design and put together a better, cleaner user interface (in fact, I have...), but I'm not the one with access to and rights to the app.",

I hate it when you give me a generic copy and paste response even though the issue I reported was clear. I gave you 5 stars, don't let me reconsider it...3rd Edit: awesome guys 👍 problem solved now.",
      "It is a excellent app for coding students and also for beginners of programming pupils. I loved it because I understand any topic to be enrolled in any course. It has a another benefit that you can get certificate in the end of courses of programming languages. Best coding application...",
      "The app logging says that the Programming hub has stopped. I had downloaded and purchased today. spent a lot of money on this app , but when logging as guest this goes fine ,so my question is that is the company giving free version to look and ask for paid to make the people fool and just to earn money Please don't download this app",
      "I think it's great! Save money and learn here- especially if you're undecided or curious about IT. It's so much easier to follow and understand for us \"beginners\"",

Also, I found the activities boring and tiring, lacking creativity.",

      "this is a very bad experience! they've designed the cancellation process in a very tricky way! -first you have to submit a cancellation request before the renewal date -they reply with an email asking you to confirm that you want to cancel the subscription (which I did) then I got no answer, couple of days later found out they withdraw the money!! I don't recommend any one to use this app, and I expect as a user to cancel my subscription any time myself without emailing or anything!",

Since, that time I have been working out how that happened, I have check on the app for an answer through the questionnaire search, I followed the instructions step by step, I even emailed them for that matter. They emailed back that if I want to continue the cancellation I have to reply them back (which I did) so they can procced my request and sent me back a confirmation email,,, and here I am still wait .

      "So far seems very functional, with the exception of one very annoying bug: whenever I try to search for an object in the free-look mode, the screen will flicker/stutter constantly with some random still frame and is extremely frustrating to deal with. Don't know if it's something wrong with mine personally because I don't seem to see anyone else having the same issue but it's very annoying. Hope it gets fixed soon.",
      "One month ago I initially downloaded the app to conttrol my telescope set up: Skywatcher Star Discovery 150 Syn Scan Wi Fi AZ Go To. It initially didn't quite work with my scope. However the support I received was unbelievable. Over the next version (within 2 weeks, over the Christmas and New Year holidays) the issue was technically fixed, something which took years for other apps. Obviously there is some very dedicated team working to develop a great app. I like also the approach in this app in comparison to other similar apps - its very sleek and user friendly design and the team's keen interest to develop it into a true digital astronomical assistant to amateurs. Would be very keen to follow the developments of this irreplaceable astronomical tool.",
      "Stellarium Mobile Plus is amazing!! i have tried other free/purchased astronomy apps, and this one has superior functionality, larger catalog of objects with a user friendly search feature for clusters, messier objects, stars and planets. i love the zoom in/out and was able to locate objects like ic1101, and view objects names from various historical cultures. the only thing I asked for was the ability to toggle kilometers to miles, and my email received a reply within a few hours. i have",
      "Awesome app I am using this frequently for stargazing, however I think the rendering the object names in regional language is a missing feature. The desktop app have an option to display the regional names for stars and planets which is missing here. The names of the object are fine but the script is still English.",
      "I've been an occasional amateur astronomer since the 1980s. This is my first use of an e-Star Atlas and I must say that this app is amazing, very well thought out, extremely easy to navigate with very responsive zooming and an intelligent menu system. It's also a wonderful mobile teaching tool for introducing newcomers to celestial and planet motion, (using the time slider), constellations, DSOs etc. On my Samsung S9 phone the active tracking after calibration works perfectly. Very well done!"

      "WORST PLANT APP. Not only does it not work, it won't let you see the result for free. They're not even RIGHT results. Ex: Por*** The apps which had a limit was far better than this thing. Idk about the western folks but if I divide RM269 by 4, you have to roughly pay around 67 dollars! And that's ROUGHLY!",
      "This app could not identiify a tulip, lily or a rose from excellent and colorful photos. I am a florist, its my business to take exceellent photos. I am quite sure any 4 year old could have done better. Since that was my first and only attempts, i feel the app is benign. I highly doubt that anything else, pittisporum, ca. Pepper, guavas, ?? Will come up equally as blank. For the sake of science, maybe try grass? See if it comes up with the i.d. such a great idea! But no.",

The 2 min free preview does give enough time to assess the quality of the show especially since half the time is spent on the intro to the episode. If i got to watch 1 or 2 episodes before paying i might think about subscribing. Not going to pay if i dont know if its worth it",

      "Magellan is a decent documentary channel though it's not as packed full as people advertise. The app itself is clean and a big perk is its seamless interface with Google cast. The downsides are there's no way to check if a documentary is in English or another language until you start it or if you navigate to it through a search and have used a language filter No options for consoles And worst of all NO pick up where you left off if chromecast brain farts you have to start from the beginning",
      "Just downloaded it the other day, enjoying it so far. My only complaint is on some of the videos the audio is a problem in that the narrator is often drowned out by the accompanying music",

      "It is really helpful in preparing for NBDE 1. The mnemonics and the explanations for every answer are very easy to understand and remember. Worth the money..",
      "Expensive, but no more than you'd expect to pay and I benefit from the casual, attractive, instructive format.",
      "I really like this app. I would recommend it as it gives you the opportunity to revise and clear the concepts very well.",
      "Very good app to complete your study! Organize and separate the topics for you showing your strengths and your weaknesses. Hopefully I pass!",
      "Devs put a lot of work into this I can tell. Glad caught it on a sale though. Hopefully they'll update mnemonics with better graphics and maybe printable version so you can print a mnemonic for a hard question and put it on a fridge or something. DLC for animated videos for anatomy, biochemistry and etc would be also a great expansion item I'd love to spend my money on"

      "The app is very interesting! It's so easy to learn new things and practice what you already know. I just wish there was more free content. I will save up money to unlock the full potential of the app in the future, when I hope I will have more time to practice as well.",
      "Great complement to the main Lingodeer app, the games are fun and help drill vocab and grammar after you initially learn them or to pick up a few new vocab words. Cheap subscription too, definitely worth it for a beginner or low intermediate language learner.",
      "Before buying or rating this app, please read: Lingodeer Plus is a supplementary of Lingodeer. It's more of a reinforcement method of everything you've learned from the latter. Practically, you want to purchase this after completing a language course in Lingodeer in order to burn things in your memory. But if you're serious about learning a language and wants to learn as fast as possible, consider buying this along your Lingodeer lessons. Learn vocabulary, context and grammar all at once.",
      "App is really for more advanced users. You have to know grammer and all the kana to be able to get much out of it. Make sure you try all the games before you subscribe because even if you've been studying for awhile it might be useless to you.",
      "Love it. Would be useful to have some grammar information though. I recommend. Thank you."

    "title":"Fortify – Quit Porn For Good",
    "description":"Fortify is an app combining a vibrant online support community with cutting-edge, research-oriented training and tools to help you move decisively in the direction of lasting, sustainable freedom from pornography.\r\n\r\nWe believe the journey toward lasting freedom can be a grand adventure involving courage, compassion, and incredible learning, involving trusted companionship along the way.  \r\n\r\nHow do we know that? Because we’ve already seen over a million people rise up and insist that turning away from pornography is, in fact, a bold, strong, sexy and rebellious thing to do.\r\n\r\nFORTIFY ORIGINS & FEATURES\r\nAfter hearing from tens of thousands of individuals asking the same question:  “Can you help me get this stuff out of my life?” the creators of Fight the New Drug teamed up with researchers, neurologists, therapists, and other mental health experts to develop an educational platform offering a series of innovative training videos, an open community forum, a detailed battle tracker and analytics,  and much more. Subsequently, 75,000 people in 155 different countries signed up to receive support. Based on feedback from early users, the entire training, platform, and experience has been updated, revised, and expanded with extensive opportunities for interaction and growth. These updates includes:\r\n\r\n*Updated Battle Tracker: Track your daily victories and setbacks to help you find patterns allowing you to make adjustments and improvements.\r\n\r\n*Messaging With Your Allies:  Send and receive secure and private messages back and forth from the people in your life you trust most and who are helping you overcome this struggle.  \r\n\r\n*Real-Time Online Support Groups:  Adult users (18+) can join a small group of other men or women in (gender-specific) support groups led by trained facilitators with experience in finding freedom from pornography. Message with group members 24-7 — anytime you need.  \r\n\r\n*Messaging With a Coach:  For adult users (18+) seeking more individualized support, they can access personalized guidance with a trained coach.  \r\n\r\nRISE AND RISE AGAIN\r\nNo matter what you’ve faced in the past, this can be a new moment.  \r\n\r\nYour freedom and your happiness are worth it. Quitting porn has been shown to boost connections and improve sexual intimacy.  Fortify users report an 85% decrease in depressive symptoms and an 88% reduction in porn use.  And over 90% also reported that Fortify helped move them toward longer-term changes.\r\n\r\nMore than simply managing or coping for a few good days, are you ready for something more sustainable and lasting?  Are you ready to join with tens of thousands of people ready to do whatever it takes to get there?",

The only reason I gave 4 stars is because you have to pay to have full access to all the resources this app has to offer. But like I said before, the free part of the app has helped tremendously.",
      "I really love this app. It gives me the motivation, guidance and wisdom to overcome not only my battle tendency to view porn ;) and even gives me solid guidelines on how to proceed the life I want to live and how I should live in order to be truly free and happy. God bless the people working diligently on this app and the people who use this app. One of the best free apps of the modern era. 10/10 very few, if any complaints. :)",

I'd definitely recommend investing in yourself by purchasing the content, especially if you spend a lot of time commuting, nothing like the two birds one rock combo. A few things, some \"courses\" frames have incomplete text where a sentence gets cut short, of the two narrators, the dude sounds like he's reading to kids. Otherwise an excellent recommendation to get ahead!!",
      "1 star because I couldn't give it \"0.\" Tried on multiple devices with multiple connections. This App is horribly SLOW! Paid $70 for unlocked features COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! If you're gonna take my $, make sure you're product works first. Typical IFSTA.",
      "Absolutely what I needed to study for my BOF. Not nearly as much reading and very interactive. I wish they had a \"one price unlocks everything\" option. But even paying for the courses, tests, etc. It was well worth my money.",
      "CAUTION! This is a $40 flash card app. The textbook chapters are on unresponsive screens and cannot be completed. The only section of the app that works is a 73-image \"Name This Tool\" flashcard program. And, sadly, IFSTA is as unresponsive as their app screens.",
      "The questions are exactly the same as the Exam prep book, you wont be warned anywhere. So don't spend your money on both."

      "It's great in that it has Latin American Spanish and an auto play feature for on the go. I didn't give it the fourth and fifth stars because the app is the same as the mobile website minutes the auto play feature and the voice recording function would be useful if told you right or wrong. Instead one has to listen to the voice too compare. I do that already as I go through the slides so it's not really useful. But I use it, along with a couple other language apps.",
      "This app is great for Chinese. This is an amazing app. Much more engaging and user friendly than Rosetta Stone, Duo lingo and HelloChinese. I love the chapter end reading assignments, offline usability, and the ability to go through the lessons hands free. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is I wish it had was a running full vocab list. One warning 小姐 does not commonly mean miss anymore it is more equivalent to the word b@$*h.",
      "Ive used the app for about 60 hours now over a year now.I have the paid version paid for by my local library. I would recommend this app to anyone and would also say the price is worth it if I had to pay a fee of $20 a month because it is a valuable tool. I am learning German so that is my reference experience. Do not forget to hit the books though this does not replace hard work.",
      "I really like Mango because it has many language options to learn. Very easy use to use app with different cultural notes according to each language. You can download the lessons for offline learning. Normal and slow speed audio cues. You can also use it on \"hands free mode\" for when you're driving, for example. From beginners to more advanced learners, I absolutely recommend Mango!",
      "Such a great app! Although the narrator is the least obnoxious of all the apps I've tried, it still gets a bit repetitive after a while. I've muted the narrator and turned off the answer timer, which vastly improved my experience. I would love if there was some sort of notation during the lesson for things like informal/formal, or if the answer needs to be said a certain way (currently only displayed during review)"

      "I got a 63 on the recruiting station practice test and then discovered this app and used it the week leading up to the actual asvab test and I got an 80! A whole 17pts higher than before and enough to become a Healthcare specialist in the army! Great app really helped and can't beat the 9$ price all the books and online study guides I saw were at least $25 I recommend this app to anyone attempting to join the military!",
      "Edit: I thought the whole thing used to be free! It was exceptionlly useful as a study guide for things one may never have known to study for prior to taking the ASVAB. Since the update, there's now only 2 sections free. It's a helpful study guide if you can pay the subscription. It does inhibit a lot of people from knowing what to expect on the actual test if you can't afford it past the trial. This was a great refresher course. I remember free and ads, guess not.",
      "Attempted the asvab 2 times and failed the 3rd time I found this app and as of today I'm proud to say I passed the test and the only difference is I only had 3 days to study the 3rd time and this app made a hell of a difference. highly recommended",
      "Outstanding! In order to really take advantage of this app, you need to pay for the subscription. However, its worth it!!! Im really impressed. I passed my test with a 75 and All of the material that i studied for was covered on the asvab.",
      "It was easy to set up and from there I could choose whatever field I'd needed the most, overall good app but bogged down a tad in questions some where irrelevant to the field I was in, but despite all of that, great app and good refresher course whether you're going into the military or not."

The other (phone) version works fine on my Android TV box but it's not so optimized for the big screen like this version.
