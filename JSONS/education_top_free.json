      "After the latest update, pressing on a classroom causes an error 'something went wrong, try again later' then I'm automatically unrolled from my class! I'm furious about this issue and it seems that many other people are getting it. It needs attention. Other than that, before the update Google classroom is great and I used it all the time to recieve assignments and post asignments",
      "Hey err... When I try log into my school account, it says \"We are sorry, but you do not have access to Classroom\" and \"Please contact your domain administrator for access\" and then it kicks me out of my school account! Weirdly though, it works through my Gmail account... I don't understand why it's saying that so please fix it! I need to work on things for school! 😭 (P. S: I'm using an Android phone)",
      "I use this app as a student. IMHO, complexity of the app is low - the task for junior developer. But even here some things aren't good. At first, menu item \"calendar\" just opens system default calendar. Silly. Secondly, there is no possibility to configure notifications. Earlier push notifications appeared the day before due date, but last week they started to show at midnight of the due date and woke me up. Big Brother decided this is convenient for all. Keep up good work. One star so far.",
      "As some people have pointed out, with one of the latest updates I can no longer access any classes or log in. The app seems to be in a Beta update... I never signed up for it... Google also hasn't fixed it yet which makes me think it isn't a serious issue for Google. Just revert the update, please!",
      "Before the February 20 2020 update it was working just fine but after installing the lastest update, it keeps removing me from my classes. I think this is an app problem because on the website version of google classroom my classes are still there. I uninstalled the app and downloaded it but now it is saying that my gmail doesn't work. I just to let you guys know that can you please update the bug, thanks."

      "This is an update to a review I wrote on March 15 regarding the issues I was having with this app. I uninstalled it off all my devises and reinstalled it. It is still a little temperamental on tab, takes longer to open and switch between learning activities, but works great on the others. My 4 year old, who could read before this, has really mastered some the reading exercises. I had to put her in the 1st grade level of learning. My 2 year old is good at math and has really benefited from the math games. If you are having issues you may want to uninstall and then reinstall the app. Also, check your security settings, they can delay your app response times.",
      "I usually don't write reviews but man has this experience been frustrating! I signed up for ABCmouse due to the corona virus to get the kids learning something while they're at home quarantining and it has been a nightmare! The main issue is that the app consistently freezes. No matter what! I have to close the app and reopen to get it working again and then sure enough, they tap on something and... You guessed it. Frozen again! Not sure if you understand exactly how frustrating it is to have a 3 and a 5 year coming to you every 5 minutes screaming \"It's not working again!\" especially when you yourself are working from home or in a meeting. I'm definitely not continuing my subscription and would advise anybody else to look elsewhere until they get some solid developers on their app.",
      "DECEITFUL. I saw an offer for a month's free trial after downloading app. However, I had to provide my credit card details to gain access to the month's free trial. I chose the yearly subscription which I believe would only come into effect after experiencing the month's free trial.To my surprise they immediately charged me for the year. Is this how a free trial work? That's not free trial it's a month free. False advertising. Extremely dissatisfied. Opening app and loading content is slow.",
      "Terrible. Is it better than sitting your kids in front of cartoons? Yes. But by a smidgeon. The claims that this enhances literacy, math, etc, are absolutely ludicrous. There's indeed a ton of content, but it's absolute rubbish. Especially noteworthy are the UX, which is an unmitigated disaster, and the technical issues (on what's otherwise a really low-tech game app), which are positively dismal, both on the app and the web version. Don't fool yourself for a second thinking that this has any sort of educational value, on any conceivable level.",
      "App freezes A LOT ! Or simply will not load . Should definitely make an update to it because it is VERY frustrating . Spent about $69 a year on this so my son could learn while I am working from home and he doesn't have access to my computer while I work so I figure this would be great for his tablet . It doesn't work on his tablet because it freezes or just simply won't load, so I put it on my phone and yup does the same thing . Looks like I am not the only one with this issue . Not happy."

      "This app could be a lot better. If you are in multiple different groups/classes, it doesn't allow you to push text notifications on which ones you want. You either get notifications via text for every single group you're in or none at all. Super annoying as I don't want nor need texts to be pushed through for every group I'm in! When you email tech about this or anything else, they're super unhelpful and won't actually address anything you asked about . Truly wish I didn't have to use this app!",
      "I use Remind for spur-of-the-moment communications with my university students. It works perfect in these kind of situations. My only complaint is that part of Remind could be geared toward college and university students. For example, the icons are clearly geared towards primary and secondary education. Unless I haven't figured out how, which could be the case, I would love it if things like the icons could be personalized or have more options that could be for college-level students.",
      "My experience with this version and the apple version were completely different. When i am typing the last few messages is hiding behind the keyboard. Not only that the app doesn't really send me reliable message notifications, yku can expand but if it's longer than the first line it won't show, it also doesn't show if they're read. Messages don't appear when the notification does. It's a very frustrating experience and I would like it if it were fixed.",
      "Its an incredibly helpful app, however it is incredibly frustrating how slow it is to send messages to teachers. Even with my own personal data, with good connection, it takes really long. I hope they fix this, or the whole purpose of communicating with teachers fast is not happening.",
      "Very great for school, but one key problem: If I were a teacher, I would want to delete old groups or messages that aren't wanted. Unfortunately, there is no way to delete messages or groups. It is great, near perfect for school communication, but I just wish there could be a way to remove conversations. Other than that, its a really great app!"

      "It's all right, but everytime I go to use it I have to log in. Which is annoying cause since we're on lockdown/isolation we're using it even more for the kids school work. And also when you login as a student, there is access to the other student's profiles- which is annoying because my kids keep clicking on their classmates accounts.",
      "App was working fine and then it kept telling me \"Oops something went wrong\". After reading multiple reviews, I uninstalled, power cycled my devices and reinstalled the app. For what? Nothing but the same \"oops\". This isn't an Oops, especially AFTER an update meant to address these issues! I have NO way to communicate with my child's teacher especially now that he's out for 2 weeks!",
      "I have used this app for a few school years & enjoyed it but about 2 months ago it gave me an error message & stopped sending/recieving texts. I've uninstalled/reinstalled it but now I get an error message to try again to log in later. I've tried it on a different device. I've tried to request a password reset but that failed also. Is there anything else I can try?",
      "Horrible! Why fix what wasn't broken? I have used Dojo for years. I have told everyone about it. Now that you have updated it, nothing works right. Yes, I uninstalled and reinstalled. I have signed out and in. Nothing is right. If I wanted my app to spin a blue circle for hours then this would get 5 stars. I need it to work regularly as my students depend on it and this new version is erratic at best.",
      "This app is an amazing tool to keeping in contact with your kids teachers. I was having a problem with my app, deleted it, reinstalled it, and even updated it (waited for an update) and still had problems. So I emailed Class Dojo and they helped me to get it working properly again! Thanks to Rachael with customer support!!!"

      "We LOVE EPIC! It helps us easily find books appropriate for my son's age as well as find books by themes that he is interested in. I love how some books are read to him while highlighting the words and how some are read for him to just listen to. It gives him fun access to books while we can't get out to the library during this virus for a VERY low price! He actually WANTS to read like 3 TIMES A DAY now! We have lots of books but I love letting him access books (appropriately) all on his own.",
      "Worked well on my phone initially, but on my tablet the start free trial option comes up no matter how many times I sign in, and also on my phone now. When I click this it tells me that its already activated and sends me back to sign in again. So, I can't access anything on my tablet or my phone, which was working earlier.",
      "Love the app but wish students could use at home. Also wish it was free for remote online learning and parents who choose to homeschool. Thank you! My students loved this site last year. Also wish it would extend to older grades as site is very easy to navigate. Sincerely Priscilla. Ps I just signed up for 1 month free and extra 30 day access for $7.99 . Ithought great time for grandkids to explore while most of us are at home during these trying times. Be safe my friends!",
      "I couldn't access to my account almost for a year. When i try to enter my account, there is some one month free page appears all the time. Now, i am really sick of it. This app charges $$ every month from my bank account. I sent email to support team, but i still haven't heard nothing from them. Also, i tried to unsubscribe on playstore, but it wasn't work . So, i don't want to spend my money on this useless app. Please, fix this problem.",
      "Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too."

      "At first, it seemed like a really fun, cool app with tons of free features. Then it began having issues. Half the time, my settings won't load and my profile won't refresh. The microphone randomly cut off and never came back on even after an hour of waiting. They're constantly bombarding you to pay for a pro version. Why would I do that when the app seems like it's still in beta with all the constant errors? I'll likely be uninstalling.",
      "The app works great and at first I loved it. As it gets more difficult (which it should), the loss of hearts is irritating. Hearts are essentially the number of mistakes you are allowed. If you run out of hearts, you can't do anything with the app for hours. You can get more hearts with gems, but they run out too. The only way around this is to pay for the premium edition and poof..... the \"free\" app isn't free anymore.",
      "Feels like a video game. It was great after I figured out how to turn off sound effects. The speaking exercises are pretty buggy. The app always thinks I'm done talking if you pause for more than half a second. The app will say that I got it wrong because I failed to say the rest of the words. I was getting to them! Can I breathe for half a second between words? I want to learn how to speak by sounding out the words slowly, but Duolingo won't let me do that :-(",
      "There are plethora of languages to learn and the approach is natural, progress is easy. However, a few cons : not enough audio of sentences, and most are of poor quality. Example in Vietnamese when the woman speaks, sound is terrible. It would be better if on the tablet the text blocks were bigger. Also, the new heart system makes the app really useless for too long. It was better before. Those who cannot afford to pay will just end up losing interest.",
      "Great app! I would love it if they would add a course for English speakers to learn Thai though. Also, once you complete a language it would be cool if you could re-activate the checkpoints so you could keep raising your levels, but without having to do each lesson individually. Finally, I would love to have the Groups/Clubs feature brought back. The social aspect of the app is really lacking. Overall though, it is my favorite language app so far."

      "Although this seems like it has the potential to be a great app, we were only able to get through one book before the app started glitching. This is a school requirement and it would be greatly appreciated if this was fixed quickly. I see from other reviews that I am not the only one having this problem.",

      "I've been using this everyday for 8 days straight now. Same thing happens every time. It's good for about half hour or so and then it goes all glitchy and frozen . Not really impressed with it since I was billed for the whole year and it isn't even working right. I get the 'program not responding' message a lot. And a few times for a couple hours it doesn't even recognize it is hearing sound at all after working perfectly So you have to stop and try again either much later or the next day.",
      "sure it's a good app. I only have a few complaints about the premium membership. May I add, the majority of the lessons and songs in order to access them, you need the membership. I want to learn not pay money every month. Mabye if you made some changes then this rating would not be so bad. The five minute work outs? Yes they help. A little. I can predict that the premium membership is where they make most of their money. Most likely because most peopel want a full version. Thank you.",
      "This is a really good app for people who (like me) are new to piano and don't know it! But the reason why i gave it 4 stars are these reasons: 1. Practice mode. So if you mess up a song twice, practice mode turns on.. And i wish, that you get a option if you want it on.. like, a \"would you like to turn on practice mode\" option whenever you mess up two times. Cause that would really help! (P.s. the practice mode is just annoying me too much, so i had to write this)",
      "This is a good app, it really helped me learn the basic 5 notes but after you do all the basic courses you have to pay to do more. After i completeed the basic 5 courses it showed me a video saying I could now play any songs I wanted, well that's not true because I have to pay to play those supposeded songs I can now play. I would not recommend this app to anyone because you don't even get the full experience you want.",
      "I absolutely love this app I use it all the also if you have a subscription you can use if on multiple devices and create new accounts with the same subscription the best part is you can play millions of songs and always adding more!!! It's worth every penny and isn't very expensive my first day I was playing Ode to joy and it's like nothing you learn in the blink of an eye and I have so much fun no problems yet thank you JoyTunes for creating this amazing app!!!"

      "This was AMAZING. But the last few updates aren't. -1 star for removing the tab system (should've brought it up before): now the calculator gets cleared when you leave it for the camera. It was fine the way it was before. -1 star for the ads. I know you guys need to make money, but this of all things is not the place to do it. If I'm sitting here trying to get my assignment in on time, the last thing I need is an ad to pop up, ruin my train of thought, potentially distract me, and waste my time.",
      "Whenever I try to use the app it crashes after about 3 to 4 minutes and it reboots making me start over. In the last minute before it crashes everything becomes very glitchy (when I try to scroll the screen shakes violently and it won't let me do anything then it crashes and reboots itself). I have tried everything to see if the glitch is a user error and it is not. Please fix this. It makes the app almost unusable.",
      "The app is amazing. Not only does it solve the equations etc but also explaines how we got to the result. It has a camera which is great so you dont have to write the long equations . The only reason i put a 4 is because they made a photomath premium which needs money so now it doesnt explain everything if you dont pay. Its sad cause now less people will keep the app because of the premium. Anyways i suggest it",
      "Don't use it, use another app. Since they got greedy and added \"premium\" (which is also way overpriced), it defeated the whole purpose of the app. It was supposed to help you understand math. Now everything is locked behind a paywall. Also, support is absolutely fake. They just Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V the answer (which is also a big sack of excrement)",
      "This app has been very reliable giving me helpful steps for every problem... up until they recently added a paywall making the app worthless unless you pay. What they should have done was let people DECIDE to pay for their new features instead of removing them altogether."

      "I saw a lot of reviews saying that text is cut off, and indeed when I first opened the app it was for me as well. To fix this go into your phone's settings and choose customization. You should at least have 2 options depending on your make of phone. I switched mine to the default font 'roboto' and now all the text shows clearly in the app.",
      "The videos are great, but sometimes there's a problem in the app, even after I finish watching certain videos such as Missing Angles \" (CA Geometry) \" and \"Simple probability: non blue marble\", it still shows they're incomplete. Please fix this issue.",
      "Love the app. The content and UI is really great. Some more features could be added though, like manually selecting video quality while streaming and downloading because sometimes the quality is so low, I cannot understand the audio and video. Also, dark mode for nighttime would really help.",
      "Love the app, I love studying , I'm a nerd like that. I'm having trouble with the videos, the sound is fine but visually it's all wrong, I can't see what's going on. I realise this is probably the fault of my phone, I just wondered if you'd heard of this issue before and would be able to help?",
      "I want to give it 5 stars for the content, idea and mission... however i can not find on the app autoplay option for videos, even worse there is no one click to go to the next video in landscape mode (like there is on youtube), which wastes a lot of energy and time, especielly while exercising (e.g. stationary bike). I will revise my review if there is an autoplay option. I am using android on samsung note phone."

      "I love this app, its great for children. My 2yo brother loves it so much that he always wants to scribble and draw something in it. And I previously explained an issue here, and it was solved for me very quick. Thanks for the amazing fast help. This app is ALL GOOD! If you just want some fun and free learning content for your child, here it is! Whoever sees this review, must download this app. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!",
      "The content is incredible and free. No adds! Based on your child age there is a tailored learning path wonderfully crafted for your child. I am amazed by how fun and interactive the learning materials are, this can't be beat. Then there is the library were you can select content if you so desire. Thank you for an amazing tool at the hands of parents.",
      "Oh my!!! This is such a great app for my daughter personally!!!! I have tried sitting down with her for her to learn her letters and it seems she gets too distracted. But she loves this app! Withen a week of her playing and learning on this she has gotten her letters down! The coloring is great as well because when we color on paper she is getting in the lines now!! I am not one to sit my kid in front of a screen but this app has helped a lot in areas im not able to get her to focus on! Love it!",
      "Excellency in an app. No ads. No pop ups or add-ons. There are lessons for all ages and my kid learns without even realizing she's learning. It is an intuitive and brilliant way to keep kids learning while they are playing on your phone. The world would be a different place if we had more apps like this.",
      "We cancelled our subscription o ABC mouse because my daughter was so bored with it ... I love that this app is free and teaches her more than any other app we have tried. We homeschool, so it's nice to have access to things like this, especially for waiting at doctor appointments or when I forget her schoolwork at home and we eat out."

The app states that a mask won't keep you safe from catching the virus then states that if you have the virus wearing a mask will prevent you from transmitting it to others. I have not taken many quizzes so I can't say if they contain incorrect or confusing and misleading information or not. Please review the information posted in your app.",
      "It was so giltchy it wasnt even funny. During one of my youth group games, i was hitting the right answer, say the one on the circle, and it would say i was wrong. Or, if all the answers given were right, it would still say i was wrong. I might like doing these games for like reviews or something, but this was just bad.",
      "it's fun, but you cant add diffrent types of questions without having to pay! You used to be able to choose the quiz type. It would be nice if you didn't have to pay and true or false and regular questions get boring! I wish you could at least be able to choose the question type and/or color of choices without paying! Maybe you could only pay for things like change the music or draw the pictures! Maybe an ad, for example to make a quiz with premium features ?",

      "If I could would rate between 4 and 3. The app works rather well a majority of the time but there are 2 specific drawbacks that each takes away about 1 star. First, The ability to customize, organizing in a way that makes it easier for the user to access what is most relevant, is present but not prevalent and certainly has potential to expand. Second, A majority of Extinctions and tools do not work. I've used this app for 4 years, and it has improved greatly and would like it to keep growing :)",
      "This app is great!! I have used this app for almost 2 years and it has always been my savior in turning things in and remembering to do homework. Most, if not all, of the professors use this app, and so do the others at the school I'm transferring to this fall. Canvas is super easy to use on both android phones and computers.",
      "The App is bonkers af, bruh. The lectures when you try to open them? Doesn't load, and downloading them is such a chore, so slow even if you have stable connection to the internet. Notifications is meh, and vague af. And the most infuriating of all is the submission stages. Like... What. In. The. World. Even. Is. This. Many Uni might've used this App up to now, but this App is mediocre at best, does its job, but having their executions flopped.",
      "Definitely not the best app. It is convenient if you want to see your assignments but does not work 100%. The notifications barely work. I can't highlight anything in the text which is extremely important to me for creating notes. It needs a lot of work or a great update.",
      "In my previous review, I stated the app was broken. But, as of a few days ago, with little fanfare, the app was fixed. A little late, but better late than never, I guess. The app works fine, but I'm still a little sour about the app being broken for so long."

      "It's good, but it doesn't really teach you how to do something in particular. You will just answer questions. Plus, when you get an answer wrong, it brings you back at least 7 points down, but when you get it correct, you get 2-3 more points back. It depends on how much time you have to answer each question. Anyways, it's a good app if you want to memorize something. Just 1 thing I would recommend is having videos before starting a new lesson. It will help people know what to expect on lessons😁",
      "Great is fun, is a great way to relax( you can enjoy math, language arts etc.) Is addictive to play and challenge yourself. If you want to download the app it take a long time. If are going to google, safari,or any of your browser apps it will not take but a few seconds to a minute.",
      "I absolutely love IXL's website format, but the app is virtually useless. The recommendations, diagnostic and automatic suggestions disappear. You must manually look up each subject, level and category, which defeats a lot of the purpose of using this program. Instead, I much prefer to use the website on my childrens' Kindles or our laptop.",
      "This is the worst educational app I have ever used. IXL is made for practice not learning. I am fine with that, except anytime you get a problem wrong it gives you the worst explanation on how to get it right. It is very lazily made and only focuses on negative reinforcement, making it a very bad experience for anyone using it. It is WAY overpriced and hated by many kids. I don't get why IXL is used. I personally recommend Khan academy as it offers very useful lessons and positive reinforcement.",
      "Fantastic app. Its a practice app not a leaning tool as some others have assumed and are giving negative feedback. Its like reviewing a workbook and saying its not fit for purpose. Please ignore comments from those who believe an app will somehow do the job of a parent/teacher. Please come up with something similar for vocabulary too... quickly."

If I could cast, I'd get the subscription. Until then this app gets 0 stars from me. Complete waste",
      "What a scam. Payment method expired so after a couple months decided to cancel the subscription. Cancelled they a few days later updated payment methods for other apps. They then decided to reinstate my subscription for Noggin without permission. I'll never use this again.",
      "Nothing works. Every time I try to verify my email address be it on my phone, tablet or computer, I get an error. Not to mention many of the games won't launch. I'm sure if things were to work properly it could be a good service. Uninstalled",
      "The recent update has changed the entire layout. Its much more confusing now with games mixed in with the episodes. The names of episodes no longer show either. When you're done watching/playing be sure to close out of the app completely or the show moght start up/continue on its own several minutes later. This is especially creepy in the evening. I'm hoping for an update/fix soon otherwise we'll be cancelling our subscription.",

People who have troble in math should download this app!",
      "Almost like a TI-84 in your pocket but different. You have to give it certain commands to find the value you want, but don't let that turn you off. I only have a couple of complaints, like the fact that there's not an option to slide along a line or parabola and get the exact value of it at whatever x or y value on the graphs like Desmos. It also doesn't have an option to pull up a table. But everything else is pretty great and the things I mentioned might be included in the premium membership.",
      "Okay, so I do enjoy this calculator as it provides the answers to your equations almost instantly with almost all of the requirements you need. Though, I don't like the subscription in order to view the steps. And now, after the past couple years, they pushed it with an ad for every problem you send. That's absurd. I'm sure they wondered why they weren't gaining money from the subscription service, well forcing an ad down our throats for every problem doesn't fix the issue.",
      "when I ask it to do uniforms, I can't even do uniform, it's just a waste of time. I don't understand why people would even like this app, I thought it would actually be good, but yep, when you take the picture, it always says that it can't solve the math problem, cause this is it correct math problem, which is really dumb, as in this app, doesn't work for me, I don't know if it works for other people or other people are just reading the app for no reason, but certainly for me, this app is bad.",
      "Really efficient and accurate. I use this to double check my work because I sometimes miss a negative sign or miss a step. This has always been right and is always really fast. Helps out a great deal. Props to the developers!"

I use it to chromecast (which occasionally doesn't work but it's usually fixed by closing and re-opening) or for last ditch distractions while or and about. So good to not have to work about the content my son could come across. Very well designed to!",
      "This such a great app. My 3 year old has no trouble using it, there are a lot of great shows and some very educational in regards to science and nutrition. I really like that the app has a lot of shows he enjoys that aren't available on our local channel.",
      "This app has not let me or my toddler down. It has always been reliable with the latest episodes even before they air on Mondays. The app has helped us on long car trips and she absolutely loves to see her Elmo, Cat and discover new shows like odd squad and Xavier riddle.",
      "My favorite kids video app ever! Even as a grown up I enjoy the videos when I watch with my kids. Everything is age appropriate and fun. Productions are super high quality they are all well thought and produced.",
      "Love PBS, grew up with it and i'm amazed with all the shows that are still going that my son can now enjoy. Unfortunately shows like Fetch (not the Ruff Ruffman Show) and Peep aren't on the app and the ones that my son watches like Cyberchase and Wild Kratts only have a few full episodes on it."

      "Very streamlined, a lot more detail than other brain training games. The games/challenges are brilliant,, it also tells you where you are most advanced. The only thing I would change is the yearly cost and make it monthly, I'm not currently working so can't afford the yearly cost in one go, so I have given the 7 day free trial a go, even in the further info about the app, it says that elevate offers a 14 day trial and I only wish that I could continue with it.",
      "So far so good, been playing for about a week. I'm enjoying the content, I like how its getting harder with improving scores and the graphics are really solid, it's a very attractive game and it appeals to my competitive spirit by mentioning how you scale with the community of players. It's a fun way to exercise brain muscles. I just purchased pro to help support the creators, and I honestly don't regret it .",
      "Excellent app, developers! My brain is getting better by the day. My language skills aren't bad, 'cause I train them for college all the time, but my math skills are really diamonds on the rough, so I'm polishing them most especially. Thank you for making this! I recommend it to anyone who needs to polish their cognitive skills. 👏👏👏",
      "great app. I would give it 5 star if there is a way to backup my progress. dont really understand the ranking system. my rankings in each game is much lower than my ranking in each skill (writing, speaking, reading and math). my skill rankings are too high and I suspect that could be because the app does not have enough users.",
      "I mostly like this app. Some of the sections are extremely frustrating because they just don't work correctly. Specifically, working with commas. The app doesn't recognize when or where you tap on your phone screen accurately. Since it works fine on other sections of the app, I feel sure it's the programming and not my phone."

      "Undoubtedly this is the best app to learn how to speak English. But, I need a offline mood. I mean after watching a video, users should be allowed to download it along with the subtitle. So that, it can be watched in app for many times without an active internet connection.... I request the developer to add this option in upcoming version... Thanks in advance.",
      "It is very nice app. With the help of \"cake\" I able to talk or share my expression in very easily and smoothly way. It also help to me to read the books of English in very fast way. But taking up the ID and their is no guest mode. In a guest mode we can't learn form the lessons .I want to say to editor that add some more good feature which help to learn English in more fun. 😊😊😊👍👍",
      "Excellent app! I've learned a lot from videos. But i really need a little more. - I need a quiz to review the lesson in speaking lesson . - I dont know why when i did not learn the lesson i have more 5 coins the day after. When i learn the lesson, i only have exactly 10 coins per lesson. I think you can give me extra 5 coins .... 10 coins For lesson and 5 coins for attendance. Ps: i only have 30 coins... So i can only get 3 lessons per day.",
      "i found this app quite good it has various ways to learn english but i faced some problems while using it the daily event isn't opening and also i was unable to play any video on this app ..please fix this problem that videos should play easily and in less data usage and also provide some extra coins .",
      "I have to say that I like the way Cake works. It's simple enough and doesn't overwhelm learners. There is only one problem confusing me. There is no lessons history and Reminder function doesn't work properly. The thing is now I have no clues to find the yesterday's lesson back. 'Search\" functions doesn't help either."

      "What a great educational app! My 9 year old with Autism loves this app. He was using it on his class and loved it so much we bought it for home use. It's totally worth the money. Easy to navigate,games are entertaining and keep him engaged. As an ASD kid that's a huge seller for me as his Mom. He's learning so much everyday. Thanks StarFall!",
      "I really, really love this app. Eventhough it's easy, my 10 and 11 year old still likes to play it. It is a very good app for those who are just learning their ABC's and 123's, as well as those who have mastered second and third grade level reading.",
      "As a teacher, I use this with my students and my 2 year old. Very good price and good for early learners, on going practice and remediation.",
      "A very useful app, helps kids to learn essential skills for reading and making mathematical processes. I recommend it.",
      "We've used starfall for about 5 years now. My daughter learned to read using this program and she still uses it, thanks to the extra grades added, as extra study in our homeschool. My preschooler is using it along with our homeschool studies and loves to sing along with the vowel songs. Hopefully he'll be reading soon too. This is such an excellent program. I love the convenience of the app, but love that I can print worksheets to go along with what we're focusing on as well. Thank you Starfall!"

      "Couldn't speak more highly of this program. The content & material it provides is undeniably the best on the market, while being fun & engaging. I've never had any technical difficulties. I bought the full personal package a couple years ago & recently recieved a free upgrade to access all languages! It was already more than worth the purchase so I am very grateful. If you actually want to start learning a language or brush up on your skills you won't regret the purchase!",
      "When I tried to do spanish it kept telling me I was doing it wrong. I personally took spanish classes and was looking for more help. I don't think this app is really good with its audio. When I try to speak into the audio its always says \"Please move to a quiet place and speak slower\". I usually speak fast so uhhh don't know what to do then.",
      "I also had the message \"SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG\" but after trying many things all I did was delete the app. Shut off my tablet. Waited 2 mins and turned it back on to reinstall and that solved the problem. Hopefully this helps others. The App version is actually very easy to use and learn. I'm satisfied.",
      "Very happy to have all languages available and grateful that they updated my purchase with it without me having to do anything. App is fun and easy to use and it checks for the accent which is the main thing. Excited to learn French and later Tagalog, Italian, Hebrew, and all the other languages I've been wanting to learn!",
      "I haven't used it much, but this is clearly not the typical language learning app I'm used to. I finished the first core lesson and didn't hear or see a single word in English, but I'm definitely more confident in what I've learned here than anywhere else. It's interesting, and in the best way. I can't wait to keep learning. :)"

      "Toca Boca is one of my favorite game development team. Seeing a free game that I haven't played before lit up my day. I think the game is great, but I have a couple problems. First off, some of the presets have makeup, and it's annoying when I don't want makeup on the character, considering I haven't bought the makeup pass. My other complaint is that when I was washing a character with long hair's hair, red lines would appear on their face. Other than these, great game and would reccommend!",
      "It's an overall fun game, but something I don't like is after I've done a person's hair, I obviously take a picture, like you're supposed to. I make sure in all the pictures the person is smiling, but when I go to put it in the like gallery part of the book, all the girls have an attitude on their face, even though in the picture they were smiling. Maybe this is a reach, but it just rubs me the wrong way.",
      "Good game and definitely best hairsalon gane of theirs yet. However I think it should come with the makeup set an not have to buy it. The game is pixely but I don't usally notice it. In my opion all the character look like girls. But if toca boca sees any of this my one real complaint is: why can't we dye their hair it was one of my favorite things from the last game so why can't we do it in this one? Overther than that great game.",
      "There's many things added to this game that I like. But I miss the randomized characters. And the packs are insanely expensive. Especially the make-up pack, when the game is advertising itself to finally have make-up? I couldn't even find the other tools at first because it didnt show that you slide up to get more drawers. Keeping it at 2 stars unless the scammy microtransactions are changed. Would have been better to sell it for 3.99 with everything unlocked like the other games are.",
      "Very good game but the packs are too expensive. This is a kids game so I don't see why the packs have to be so expensive. I understand you already made it free there should be a in app purchase but it's too expensive. Maybe lower the price a little. Not all parents wants to buy their kids these packs or games."

      "New to this app! I remember BrainPOP from when I was a kid. I loved viewing the movie of the week with my 4 and 7 year old and doing the quizzes with them. Upon exploring the app more I tried clicking the free movies button and it oddly doesn't work, even though the rest of the app worked flawlessly. It would be great if this could be fixed so I can decide if I want to buy anything extra in the app.",
      "Ota really good for edication and small learning for kids and all ages besides adults of coures! BrainPOP jr is really good accept you really need to get rid of the log in and subscribe because my parents and I think its a little unessicery for an adicationel app!!",
      "You have to PAY money for most episodes it's so unfair because if you'll just want to watch a video about butterflies you either have to pay $3 per month or $7 per month I suggest don't download this cuz you can only watch certain it episodes and because the quizzes so hard like they say do you want to do the easy quiz or the hard quiz both of them AR hard so I don't know why they did that",
      "I really love this educational app because it is really easy to navigate and learn everything",
      "It helps you learn a lot of things like that multiplication, divison ,plus and more it is an amazing app"

      "The ads are way too advanced for a child under five. I kind of can tolerate an ad that has half naked women games as my boys probably don't understand that, but I do not tolerate the buddy games. My two year old loves watching and singing these songs. All of a sudden he let out a scream that makes a parent stop breathing. He continued to cry for about ten minutes. The ad on was the buddy game. Buddy got his head cut off and blood shot everywhere. This is not appropriate for little ones.",
      "Was a good app for a while. Even paid for no ads, then they added what looked like a new small game but it is a link to Amazon to buy a pinkfong book. Toddler constantly wants to click this and gets frustrated when it doesn't work. Don't charge for ad free then disguise an ad as part of the game.",
      "loving the app. my toddler loves Baby Shark. but the ads are annoying. get rid of the ads. if i have to pay for the app to have an ad free experience i will. please remove ads. thank you.",
      "Ridiculous amount of ads. There is literally an ad after every video and game. My 3-year-old had 16 browser windows open today trying to close them himself. I will be deleting this app the first second he shows boredom towards it and will NEVER download another app made by these people."

    "comments":[
      "I am a beginner and I can only rate this three stars because of the sensitivity of the note recognition. I will have a set of three notes. All the same and all played without moving my hand and it will often register some were missed even though no changes were made to my hands. If I am playing the same note and I get it correct the first time, why would the second time be missed and the third time be spot on? All in all it's a good teaching tool for basics, but I wouldn't pay for it.",
      "This would be an amazing app if only it would actually hear the notes when you play. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to actually get the app to pick up what you are playing and it constantly says you are hitting the wrong string for no apparent reason. The actual set up of it seems great I just wish it would work like it is supposed to...",
      "I would give you 5 stars but, do you have to restrict lesson time if you don't get premium. I mean that is just wrong. Some people can't afford monthly/yearly subscriptions, and I would like to have as much time to really immerse myself in singing. I would really like it if you would take ulimited lessons off of premium because some people (like me maybe) probably can't afford it and can move at a faster pace.",
      "I've dabbled in guitar over the years. Never been able to stick to it because I couldn't afford lessons and couldn't see the results I wanted. After 2 months on this app I was able to play lean on me. I've spent anywhere from 5 to 15 hours a week. Just stick with it and use all the exercises don't just try to play songs. Totally recommend!",
      "Everytime the app tells me to play a chord it finds a dead note even though I check that each is playing individually and they do. I can hear it even all together and I used the tuning function to make sure that it wasn't the issue and all is good. Otherwise it's ok I just can't pass this hurdle wich means I can't progress to learn more."

It doesn’t yet really “solve” certain problems, in the way that Microsoft’s Math app does, but it brings up extremely similar examples that one can extrapolate to find a solution.

      "Excellent app great structure. The structure is very repetitive though, I know what to expect as in it always starts with a few new phrases, then you have to type them, then it's the conversation followed by lots of information educating you about sentence structure. A massive room for improvement would be if I can practise what I have learned from the beginning. The review should bring more stuff from the beginning as it primarily consists of recent topics and not topics from a long time ago.",
      "This is ridiculous. I used this platform before and always loved it. Now it's not working. More specific the mic. Yes I already checked the mic itself, the app has permission to use the mic as well. Also no background noise. Still doesn't work. It just doesn't seem to record anything and says try again over and over again. I did not pay so I could not use the mic function! Usually I never write reviews but now I am actually mad. Not cool.",
      "The app is quite good but sometimes the chapter isn't finished even though I just did it (with correcting my mistakes). As well when you have to tap the right picture to the expression, at the beginning of a chapter, the app often freezes. I have to close the app and repeat the things.",
      "The only thing that stops this getting 5 is the inability to change the size of the text. I would like to make the words slightly larger to make it easier . Update 15th March 2020- Also the listen and complete is painful. In other parts of lessons when you press the sleaker button it says it slower and the press again it says normal speed but not in listen and complete. It needs to be the same.",
      "It's def a great app ,just by taking the first lesson I can tell I would learn the language fast with this app. The only downside is you have to buy a monthly subscription. The price is the reason I'm giving it 3 stars. Please consider lowering the cost so It can be more affordable and more people can have access to it."

Example energy flows, I know this is pretty basic but I just wanted to try it out. when I try to take the picture the little box thing when it get bigger or smaller so I couldn't exactly take the picture that I needed and it will always come out.

      "A wonderfully built app. The graphics when zooming in on certain planets are great. The thought that was put into the sound effects was a nice touch. It's also, a great learning tool for teaching my son about the constellations, stars, planets and various meteors/asteroids. Although, I think he's more happy to be awake late at night to watch the night skies...",
      "Excellent app for the night sky, helps me keep my internal, mental ; with a \" 1956 model brain \" compass in perfect shape and function. I navigate with the north star on this side of the equator and of course the southern cross below it, and I learned that in the boy scouts in 1965 to get my first badge of tenderfoot. Ask a kid to do that now and I'm gonna bet that they don't have a clue exactly how to do it or what that means to guide by the stars. . right.",
      "I did love this app. It has helped me teach my son a good but about astronomy and the work is grand father and great grandfather did for NASA. I have say, its not working well on my new phone. The camera option isn't in the screen so I can't get it to tell me what I am looking at and it just will not auto orient like it does on my old phone. That is unfortunate. Not sure what exactly sure what is going with this new android.",
      "Fantastic app so far. Writing first impression now, will follow up after digging in to it more. I will say, I bought the full bundle on second night out. First night, only tried a couple minutes, didn't take my time. Second night I brought my reading glasses out (cough) and 'figured it all out'. I would give 10 stars if possible; this is exactly what I needed to give my kids an ooh and aah astronomy moment (3d constellation view). Will return later for update after more digging!",
      "I Really Love this app!! Being able to point my phone anywhere, even beneath my feet, and have everything mapped out for me, the stars, constellations, planets, etc., is Wonderful!! I also love the notifications I get that tell me about the different events that are currently happening! I have seen meteor showers that I Definitely would have missed otherwise, even in the city with \"light pollution\"! I don't even have the add ons that you can pay for on this app. This is worth the download!"

      "Would be 5 stars on computer. But on Samsung it doesn't work. I can't even get past downloading it, and I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A! The reason why is because it's slow to download, and it would say \"Checking for Wifi\" when I clearly had Wifi! I read plenty of the reviews and see why people are upset with it. It's also very outdated. It hasn't been updated since March of 2018, and that was over a year ago! On computer it's amazing, and I'm on level 18. If only it would work on Samsung.",
      "This app is stated to work on my samsung tab. It don't. I've had numerous emails with Lexia. They seem to need to practice on their own app. As their comprehension of the written language seems to need extensive work. I have clearly stated the issue with the app. They keep asking for teachers email. I can't even get that far in the app. That question and situation is moot. They have said for years they are working on making this app available. Yet won't get it working for listed android devices",
      "For as much money as schools pay, it's insane that this app works as poorly as it does. Just downloaded it from the Play Store and it lets me log in but then kicks me out saying the version is out of date. I just downloaded it. Wife is a teacher, said the poor performance of the app is well known",

      "It's novel & bearable for grades 1 thru maybe 3rd, maybe. Beyond that her voice gets annoying, her speaking pace is painfully slow, is it condescending or is that our imagination? The slightest mistake sends one into a monotonous loop to then start over. The school blames the child for not wanting to use it, but seriously it's horrible, why would they want to. Oh then one finish levels & come September it sends them back down to redo the horrible content with that awful voice again. Year after godforsaken year."

The concept of the app is great and the feeling of accomplishment is awesome. However, after awhile you feel like you're just following directions rather than learning. I understand the idea behind following steps and keeping things simple, but at some point w need to have assignments without guidance since the concept was given prior the exercise. Constructive criticism",
      "While it might look a bit too 'elementary' at the beginning, this is to explain the concepts in the simplest terms. That being said, I feel the app does too much of the work for the user, robbing them of the chance to better cement the ideas being taught by implementing them on their own terms.",
      "I like the app, but I can't change test answers when I get them wrong, it's upsetting. I would think the long term use of keeping a test is to have another example of a correct answer. An answer being permanently wrong attached to your account is detrimental to the learning process (a real life test would have the correct answer shown after the grading. For another, it's anxiety inducing to have permanent marks because the major benefit of a free online course w/o no teacher is no pressure/GPA",
      "For complete beginners. Many hints & explanations; very easy. JavaScript without typing: select what you want to code from box of functions app has taught. Can't write better code using loops in topic one: no loop in the box to select. No way to skip things you already know. I'd rather code on a computer in a programming environment like Eclipse; its hard to click the exact spot you want to modify the code on a touchscreen. Longer code becomes unwieldy on the small screen. Not fun; too easy."

      "The lessons are good but the servers of this app are non-existent. The video keeps on buffering after every 4 or 5 seconds even though others apps work smoothly with the same network connection. The same is true for the Udemy website. It becomes frustrating after a certain time and the excitement to learn vanishes. I kept waiting for an hour to watch a 16 minute lesson and wasn't able to complete it. It was either a problem with the lesson or the Udemy server. It keeps on buffering.",
      "Works great but facing problems while playing videos and opening pdf lessons of my course at times. The videos get stuck displaying a message telling me to play the videos from my computer instead. It isn't a connectivity issue. The pdfs simply refuse to open while the ones on my phone open as usual. Moreover, this app works well only on high speed connection. When connected to the WiFi the video playback speed drastically reduces. I hope the problems get resolved soon. Thank you Udemy",
      "Hello Udemy team, I have an issue regarding the screen resolution. I cannot watch the videos in full screen body ratio. The width of the videos are fixed to certain level. And we cannot even zoom. As you can see when I play a video in YouTube. I can get Full screen display ratio. It would be better user experience. If you update it to the full screen size ratio. and also great helpful for mobile user's. Please look into it and let me know. Thank you. Kind regards.",

They are, 1) Even after downloading the whole course I am unable to view it when my internet is turned off or my phone is in poor network zone. 2) Recently I have bought a new course but I am unable to make the course offline, the download button does not work. Hoping to hear on a resolution soon for you. Thanks & Regards, Kevin Rodrigues"

      "I love this game. My 2,3 and even 5 year old LOVE it and are very engaged. For $8 a month is nothing. This app keeps them engaged and happy, laughing at the funny videos and bragging about new skills. Sounds crazy but it's great. MY ONLY COMPLAINT is the sticker games. You have to do it with your child for the best benefit. Sometimes the games won't go to the next level so we have to redo the entire area but it's honestly not a big deal because they're still having fun.",
      "I have been struggling to find something all my kids would enjoy (stubborn kinder, struggling 2nd grade reader, pre-k advanced reader, and 3rd grade doing good reader). This program has been wonderful for all of them! My stubborn kinder loves it and doesn't get bored and fight me about it, my struggling reader likes that it changes and isn't the same thing over and over again, and my older reader likes the stories!",
      "Homer is educational and fun for the children. For my little kids, it includes all areas of English: sounds, letters, books, and more. Homer then puts those building blocks in a way that makes sense to the kids. When I can't teach them, I can trust that Homer will do it right. My kids now request to use Homer on a regular basis. Plus, the price was right. Thanks Homer for putting this program out there for my children!",
      "I appreciate that this program offered a 1 month free trial. I had been interested but afraid to try. Now I see Homer is absolutely worth the monthly rate. My son loves electronics, of course. And I always try to limit them for all the behavior and health reasons pediatricians warm us about. This app lets my son play electronic games while building his kindergarten reading skills! This app has given us both something we want and we both enjoy it!",
      "Great app until the recent update. Crashed constantly, I tried uninstalling & reinstalling the application and still wouldn't load. Contacted service and they were great at resolving my issue in a timely matter. My daughter loves this app and is only 20 months and learned to identify letters and colors. Everyday she says a new word! Definitely worth every penny."

      "I am absolutely happy with this app. It can identify any plant, tree, flower, or weed and very quickly. If it's a close call it will give several options to choose from letting your eye decide. It also let's you contribute your photos to the database of photos if they don't have many of that plant. It also tells a little about the plant where it lives best, best feeding and watering practices. I do recommend Picture This to identify plants you see around you every day.",
      "So far it's been a good app. Its 7 out of 10 times right when I take a rough picture, but honestly some of the plants I take pictures of I do it to try and trick it to see how it responds. Im a groundskeeper so honestly I would trust it if I had to give it a shot in the dark. I also like that if it doesn't know it I can suggest a name or ask. HOWEVER I do not recommend any app looking for edible versus poisonous plants, like some people will try to use this for.",
      "I kind of like the app at the start and was excited to use it.However, it cannot identify several of my plants and at times you still have to guess which one from the options and it makes me doubtful of the accuracy of this app. When I suggest a name esp for those I know of, it won't reflect the name, instead it reflects the very general one like 'hen and chicks'.I was not very happy and didn't want to suscribe but I missed to cancel before the 7th day and so yeah, I was automatically charged.😔",
      "Great app at identifying plants! I would give it 5 stars of it had a \"notes\" section for you to add other information you like to keep on hand. I use plants as herbal remedies, so if I had a place to write the benefits, ways to use it and their actions, I would change my 4 to a 5 asap!",
      "The app is NOT FREE at all 😡.After getting information about 2 plants,I was not able to get information aboutthe third plant onwards. The app everytime takes me to a page where I am asked to collect ID's. I collected .5 ID by watching an ad hoping I would get information about plants but in vain.So, what's the use of watching that ad if it doesn't solve my purpose ? I'm not going to pay.Is there any other way which solves my purpose otherwise I'll have to uninstall the app ?Kindly let me know"

      "It is good if you don't have homer app. But this is disappointing. Advertisement highlighed this as alternative to YouTube, however it links directly to YouTube ChuChu TV channel. I can't stand it even if my child loves it. So sorry, no, 1 minute of trial was enough for me. I like homer app better as it has more individuality to it and lovely songs. And by the way, I can use basic trial version for free all the time not only 7 days.",
      "SCAM, registered on 12, turned out app is rubbish. Tried to cancel on the website -you can't because I paid through website not play store. Sent an email on 17 to cancel subscription. Received lame email what to do if paid with each method of payment but message said clearly to not to charge me. On 19/03 got receipt for $60 despite originally it meant to be $5 a month and I got charged even though I asked to cancel it few days before it wasn't done. Look at the comments, loads of people same!!!",
      "The games is great but it kept froze and stop working which have to close and reopen again, very dissapointed and cant get my refund despite i just paid and experience all this trouble on 1st day. Definitely wont continue my subscription and not worth paying the money",
      "Wayyyy too glitchy. Freezes constantly. Can't go even a couple minutes without getting stuck. Great idea, but too frustrating. Should be taken down until the technical issues are resolved.",
      "A mistake was made and we seem to have purchased the app. We have never even attempted to use the app other than the first day looking through it. It never worked on my device and now getting a refund is close to impossible. I was given a help link and nothing has ever come out of it. 60 dollars down the drain and no Support for the incompetent app or refund."

They will learn to pronounce and spell in English, from the ABC to even more complex sentences and conversations. <br><br><b>Download the app and enjoy its content!</b><br><br>In Lingokids you’ll find the best English songs for children, the most fun videos with its characters, audiobooks, printable worksheets for each topic, interactive exercises, and an endless supply of activities to learn over 3,000 words in English. <br><br>Topics: <br>★ Numbers - Learn the numbers in English and their pronunciation. <br>★ Alphabet - Writing and grammar games aimed to teach sounds, pronunciation, phonics, and intonation of the words when talking and how to write them in English. <br>★ Colors - Learn how to write and pronounce the colors. <br>★ Shapes - Describe and help memorize the geometric shapes.<br>★ Animals - Name spelling and pronunciation of all sorts of different animals. <br>★ Food - Vocabulary and phrases related to fruits, vegetables, utensils, and cooking verbs. <br>★ Up to 72 topics to learn to communicate in English and to become bilingual. <br><br><b>Features</b><br>- Constant updating of contents: new activities each month. <br>- Parents Mode: Manage your subscription, select your child’s favorite activities, access level tests and check the progress reports (learned words, time spent… ) <br>- Offline Mode: Download the activities to your device and learn without an internet connection. <br>- Multi-profile: Customize each student’s profile (age, level, etc.)<br>- Adaptive Learning: The learning method adapts to the child’s English level, creating lessons customized through a hits-and-errors algorithm. <br>- Printables: There’s additional study material included in each topic. <br>- Timeline: Find out about all the different features that “Lingokids, English for Kids” will offer.<br>- 100% Safe environment for children, since it complies with the COPPA regulation (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act).<br><br><b>Scientific Backing</b><br>It’s scientifically proven that a child’s brain is prepared to learn different languages especially before a cognitive process known as “synaptic pruning”. The more a child is exposed to a language, the greater the chances that they will become bilingual. With “Lingokids, English for Kids”, children learn without even realizing it, thanks to its ludic approach. <br><br>Recent studies show that with Lingokids, children learn twice as much vocabulary than with traditional methods used in English classes. <br><br><b>Awards</b><br>- Mom’s Choice Awards<br>- National Parenting Publications Awards<br>- The Lovie Awards<br><br><b>Contact &amp; Social Media</b><br>Help &amp; Support: https://help.lingokids.com/<br>Email: hello@lingokids.com<br>Privacy policy: https://www.lingokids.com/privacy<br><br>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Lingokids/<br>Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTl91e4cxOjpphrLuNXVQ2A<br>Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingokids<br>Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/Lingokids_english_for_kids/",

      "This is a very good app. And it has my child very occupied. But she came to me because she can't continue after 3 or 4 games. And I don't live in the USA to have money to spend on a game. So now she likes the game but because it won't let her continue she is very sad. The parents who have the money won't understand or maybe they will. I'm disappointed",
      "Content is interesting indeed, but there are something not so good: 1. I cannot move back to the previous unit for my child to revise what he has seen. 2. The video (player) is unreasonably resource demanding. It makes some low-end devices extremely slow (can't respond to the home button even).",
      "I love it! My son loves the characters, and has learned many words in just one week. IT is easy to use and has many varied activities.",
      "Absolutely terrible with the amount of money they want and the amount of stuff you receive. For me the worth is £3 for the entire experience but they want a subscription of monthly £12 and use the old tactics of rate and invite friends. Definitely not appropriate for children. Horrible! I hate it! There are free apps of much better quality.",
      "I cannot take this no more when I first download this app they never ask me about my card information what they asked me it was about my baby's name and all, after four days later I check my online banking and found out they have taken $15. 99 I was pretty mad now I am trying To cancel everything isn't showing me where to cancel please do something about this."

      "Quizlet is amazing! I use the free version, and still get everything I need out of Quizlet. Whether it's last-minute cramming or a study plan set weeks before a test, quizlet is a perfect tool. You can even include multiple languages, play games, use flashcards, and assess your skills. Teachers can use it for tests and quizzes too! Whether you're a student, teacher, or just a curious individual, get Quizlet and explore! Trust me😁",
      "I didn't know that flashcard apps were that advanced nowadays. I got the \"go\" premium membership to remove the ads, that's fair. Only complaint : The auto completion when creating sets is great, but the way it's made doesn't make much sense to me. I'm learning Russian vocabulary and the app picked that up very well, but as soon as I've written a Russian word it should suggest the English translation as a \"definition\" instead of suggesting the word I just typed.",
      "Needs improvement. Agree with the other comments. There needs to be a merge/split set option. Also, I like the scan document icon but only available when you first create the set then it disappears after you saved the set. Also, you can't delete the set from the folder on the app; and you can't shift the order of the cards by dragging it, it can only be done on the computer version but not the app.. Please also have an option to display which sets to display on the main page",
      "While reading the 1100 vocabulary book, I felt the need to somehow find a way to review the vocabularies I learn throughout the book for the future review (without having to carry the book with me!) And I'm happy that I found Quizlet! :) Easy to use and an awesome app to have and count on for learning languages.",
      "This app is the ultimate study guide. You can create multiple sets of cards. If a particular card stumps you every time you see it, click the star. You have the option later to study only the starred ones so you can concentrate on the things you need help with the most! Also, you can see similar questions & answers to what you're typing, allowing you to select those and save time. One suggestion would be to make finding & editing particular cards easier, instead of having to hunt thru the set."

It's really upsetting, especially now with all the coronavirus&social distancing measures, when it's so important to keep in touch with our students and not lose contact with them. Could you please fix it? Thanks so much!",

I hope this to be solved, thanks.",
      "I'm a language teacher and I've been using Edmodo for years. It's been working fine until this school year. It glitches a lot, especially when my students need to log in without using Google. I'd still recommend it to people though. It's generally pretty easy to use and I can locate my previous assignments and tests pretty easily from the library.",
      "This app is ALWAYS glitching and for a second i thought it was my phone but its not because a lot of my friends that are using edmodo have the same exact problem. There is a bunch of bugs and errors. In my opinion this app isnt helpful at all everytime i get on this app it always tells me i dont have internet connection, and its always glitching. I really do not like this app.",
      "This would be a fabulous app, IF they could get the glitches worked out, it has been very inconsistent some days it works and the students collaborate and conversation flows, most days however, students and myself as the teacher do not get posts, are unable to post, are being knocked out of the app....etc. I gave it a 3 for the potential of what it may be able to offer one day."

      "Wow! The best app of helping you with math, I am not joking about that. This shows videos and shows solution steps without any payment. Totally free! Thank you so much! You can also take a picture, and the camera lens are very bright, brighter than the other apps I used which were blurry and small print. Thanks a lot!",
      "I am not the type to leave reviews as most apps seemingly do not deserve it but this one is well put together by Microsoft. It articulates all math problems and shows required work. Perfect for the new curriculum with my kids. Math is nowhere the same as they used to be and now I'm able to keep up. Thank you very much for the Fantastic app!!!",
      "Yes! Love this app. Please never do what photo math did. This microsoft math app is the best. Explains each step why you take the step amd where to go from there. Very limited ads. And what i really like is they link youtube videos of examples and practice of what your doing like khan acadamy its amazing 10/10 you should get this! Helped me so mhch and i am starting to understand my math haha",
      "Best app ever for solving algebra. It provides us with steps and also with alternate solutions. Eg. If you type a quadratic equation, then the app will provide you with the roots of the equation also with will provide alternate solutions of derivative and integration of the same question. Thanks to all the developers for providing us with a helping hand!!",
      "Just an amazing software! I'm not even gonna lie but wow! You just gotta draw your sums and it's doing all your homework! It just blows my mind the way it works!! Definitely recommended to people of all ages! No matter how complicated the sum is, it's gonna do it All!! Just love 😍 it! Thank you Microsoft for developing such an amazing app which helps in daily life of a high school guy like me!!!! 😀"

      "Amazing app and function created by Samsung! As always, I'm thoroughly impressed by Samsung and how they continue to provide great products, services, knowledge, and charity to it's customers. My only issue is that about a well ago after i started the, \"Earn rewards by charging, \" and in a week, I haven't earned any rewards to donate to the charity causes. I know my phone is plugged in charging, otherwise i would not have the battery life to even write this review 😂 Thanks!",
      "Love the whole idea and purpose. Especially the wallpaper donation feature. However it keeps resetting, asking to be turned on over and over. Isn't it supposed to remain turned on? Kind of annoying, to have to do it over and over and over. I am quite frankly almost turned off by it now... Please let me know if I am Doing it wrong or something.... If a glitch... How to fix???? Thank you",
      "I love the goal of this app, it's awesome. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the app doesnt always play adds while charging. Haven't had any problems or errors, no malware or anything. It didnt download on it's own as it has happened to others apparently, my phone directly asked if I wanted to download it, so I'm not sure what people think is going on. I totally support Samsung and its efforts in helping the UN (which isnt a communist entity at all for those that think it is smh).",
      "I think this is a great way to raise funds to help these different initiatives!! I also like that you can choose which cause you would like to donate the money to. My only thought is to have a section where we can go to watch ads and raise more money. I only see 3 ads at a time and once I've watched/clicked on them I have to go searching for more. It would be more convenient and we would be able to raise more money if they were all readily available in one spot.",
      "Not bad if you don't mind the adds. They are silent so it doesn't startle you or any thing. Money generation is verry slow but definitely rewarding. If all I have to do is let the adds do their thing and I can donate even what little it makes then great it's better then nothing!!"

      "It normally works well. A little slow like someone said but overall a great app to connect with parents using posts, messages, volunteer requests, conference sign ups, etc. Today for some reason I am not able to see who has viewed my most recent post. The parents cam sees it fine. I can still message them but it continues to say 0 out of 21 even though I know they can see it. Please help. I have un and reinstalled with no change.",
      "I really like the majority of the features. But the app is SLOW! It's very time consuming doing small tasks like trying to message a parent. Also as a teacher you are unable to 'react' to parent comments. I've had several parents say the app just stopped working for them and I had to delete them and re-add them.",
      "Very good application required for specially for parent and teacher of school level student. If you are a sensible parent, teacher or school leader, you can communicate to other parties to improve educational level of your student. Good performance and graphics as well.",
      "Can't log me in consistently using my Google account. Also takes me out of the app to login. Once you get into the app there are so many ads its almost unusable. The interface gives too much focus to the ads.",
      "Since using Class Tag communication has been great. I wish it had a few more languages (Pashto specifically) but getting parents to use it has been pretty easy and I love that I can see when they have seen my latest message!!😍"

    "title":"PlantNet Plant Identification",
    "description":"Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand! Pl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it. \r\n\r\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads or cacti. Pl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature of course but also those that grow on the sidewalks of our cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\r\n\r\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. Flowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant (or the tree if it is one!) is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.  \r\n\r\nAt present Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. Don't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\r\n\r\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\r\n- The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\r\n- The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\r\n- The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application. \r\n- The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\r\n- The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\r\n- The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\r\n- The mapping of your observations.\r\n- Links to many factsheets.\r\n\r\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/",

My daughter was having trouble early in the year, so her teacher recommended using Splash Math to practice at home. When she finished the school year, she was one of the best in the class!

I wouldn't mind so much having a free version and a paid app, but misleading with a \"free\" app that only works through in-app purchase is despicable.",

      "This app used to work great, but they somehow managed to make it just not work at all. My powerschool ID and password used to work perfectly fine, but now it says they are invalid. I tried logging in using my school email and password, got to the part where it asks if I want to stay signed in, then it just stopped working. Every time I want to retry it I have to reinstall the app.",
      "This app worked great until this year. Every time I try to check my son's grades I either have to log out and back in or completely uninstal and reinstall the app then log back in. I've contacted support several times only to find a temporary fix. The very next time I try to check his grades I have to start from scratch. I'm glad this is his senior year. I'm uninstalling the app. I hope they get things fixed. It was a great app his first 3 years of high school.",
      "I love how this app keeps track of your attendance, grades, and where your currently standing in school. The only reason why I give it 3 stars is because sometimes it does not update itself, you have to refresh and then certain things that have been updated will show.",
      "Multiple issues . It seems like it allows me to view 30% of what it should. Won't allow me to change my contact information such as my email Past 4 years this app has become more and more frustrating. Blows up my phone all day yet won't let me navigate. Not a fan at all. Major pain in my ass is the review it gets for me",
      "UPDATE 2/25 - Thank you for the follow up. I will continue to keep you posted. UPDATE 2/25 - In response to the developer \"stating Hi tysweetpea. Thank you for the update. We are happy to hear that the issue you have been experiencing has been resolved, but please note that no updates to the Android PowerSchool mobile app have been pushed out yet so it is likely that your school district may have resolved the issue with your school's PowerSchool server.\" The district didnt resolve the issue on their end... you updated the app fo include the schedule, calendar it appeared it may have corrected itself. Fingers crossed that it continues to work. UPDATE: After several communications via email and the community webpage, an update and correction to the app was pushed through and I was able to access the app successfully..... I am having the exact same issue as Adam Henke. I have a Samsung too. PS will not take ownership of this issue and refer me to the district. The district cant help or figure it out either. PS you need to find the bug for all to be able to utilize this app."

      "All of the low reviews on this are so funny to me. A lot of them are adults reviewing the game that's not meant for them. One of the reviews complains about the characters being too simple and not having enough depth. This is a children's game. It's supposed to be simple and bright and does the job with what is has. Every kid I know loves this game along with the other toca options.",
      "Nice game it is very easy to play and it is joyful game i play this game every day but I don't think it's possible that we will be able best for us and hopefully we'll have to do something different to make sure it is not the first game of our time in our country but I think it's important for me and my family and to make the decision that we are in and the club players are very happy",
      "The game is quite good, but I wanted more food and cooking options. Also more seasoning so you can make it a bit more fun. I would highly recommend though. The graphics are pretty good in my opinion but not as good as Toca Kitchen 2 which I favour. I only got this app for twenty minutes to compare them, but if Today Kitchen 2 is not available on your device, I would recommend this as second option.",
      "It's weird...... But cool this game is really really fun! It might be the most fun games ever!!! Everybody should buy this! Well you dont have to. But I will like the people who have and are buying this game! 5 star!!!!!!!!",
      "Well everything is fine except one thing. There is this weird thing that happens with their eyes. Other than that, I like it"

A DOT!!!REALY A SMALL DOT?EVEN A BABY COULD GET OVER THAT!!!!",

Terrible that it's not allowed on a phone - what if there's no other computer in the home to test/try it on? For being something used in schools; this application lacks in the most basic way.",

      "Love this app! I was not expecting to honestly. The imagery is stunning. For example, the 3d view of artifacts is so detailed you can literally see the texture as if you're physically in the museum browsing these works of art. Extensive collection with lots of variety. I experienced no glitches or crashes. Very useful and educational!",
      "Though my phone has plenty of space and I have no problems with other apps, this app often wouldn't open at all. Tried the art selfie and all it did was take a photo then stall for several minutes with dots on the photo, then it said take another photo (with the first one still on the screen so it was hard to line up correctly). Just a loop. Lighting and background changes didn't help. Uninstalled. Seems like a good app if you can get it to work.",
      "It is better than being physically present in the museum in some ways. I could explore all of art of some artists and read their journey and their background. I would open the Google maps in one tab and trace their journey through Europe. Compare the present day streets from what the drew on canvas. Great experience.",
      "This is not just one of, but best app for exploring world history, art and culture, virtual tours of historic museum, town and sites are wonderful features. Best App for explorer, archeologist, art lovers, painters, even students and features who are passionate about our core value of past.",
      "Great idea and would LOVE to explore, but the street view feature (click to explore) doesn't work at all, and this was the only reason I downloaded the app at all"

      "Glitches now, all of a sudden... I log in successfully, app tells me in a little red bar at the bottom it failed, or if I managed to get in the app to use, I open a class and it crashes and kicks me out. Never once on Apple has this happened until I came to Android. Please fix!! 😒",
      "Extremely helpful for the adult learner. Always being on the go, I am usually left in the dark when it comes to my grades. Not any longer! This app helps me stay up to date on my academic progress as well as keep me on track with upcoming assignments. There are a few bugs: sometimes I am unable to view the individual assignment grades and/or feedback from instructors. Overall, I completely recommend downloading and using this app!",
      "I love using this app for writing discussions or responses. I would give it 5 stars if it was working correctly again. Halfway through this term, I could not access my grades nor graded assignments. Last term I could. Now I get a blank screen-on the bottom it says \"Oops somethings not right\". I would hope this gets fixed."

      "Great for communicating with teacher but difficult to use. For example, had trouble figuring out how to send a private message vs a public message. We have received messages that should have been private and I had to send a private message regarding my child, although I figured it out, was difficult and uncertain was private.",
      "There are many things I love about Bloomz! You can do many things from the free version as well, which I have. First it is a safe way to message parents without giving your personal number. Second, it acts like Facebook where you can post a photo and parents can comment. One of my favorites is setting up classroom events and searching for parent volunteers or for parent teacher conferences you can add time slots and parents can pick their choice. It is a great tool for parent communication!",
      "I enjoy the bloomz app. I enjoy that it has sign-up capabilities. It works better for me than sign up genius.the parents can find everything in one place instead of having to use multiple apps.the only glitch is that sometimes media has trouble loading in parents are unable to see pictures that are posted without downloading them first.",
      "Its a great way to communicate with teachers but charges you for extra as in translate and save pictures into phone. Little things you would think are free. Just checked $19.99 parent premium a year or $1.90 something a month. Its not worth it teachers and parents aren't on it enough to charge that much. But it lets you receive messages from teachers and other parents. Even shows events and option to sign up and volunteer via app so that's a upside.",
      "I've tried other communication methods in my 5th classroom, but Bloomz is the best! Families can be connected through email or text. Send weekly newsletters, documents, photos, videos, and alerts. Messages have read receipts and translate options. Add behavior tracking, schedule conferences, and make student portfolios without ads! You need Bloomz!"

      "Great content for my 3 and 4yr olds to start learning. Unfortunately it let's let down by the fact that it regularly freezes on the 'loading' screens. Between every game we need to restart the app. We are using a brand new, high quality tablet so this shouldn't be the issue.",
      "My 2 and half year old loves this app. And has lots of great homework material for parent to do with the kids. But it seems to have a couple of problems some of the games will freeze or gets stuck on the loading page. Also I think it would be good if you had to hold the back button for a couple of seconds to exit a game.",
      "Everything is too small for a 3yo to press. My son gets so frustrated at all the \"game overs\" from pressing slightly off-target that he won't play certain games e.g. Word Grid. Not sure why when there is so much whitespace around the small box in the middle. Why not just fullscreen that area? Also one of the games in Lesson 1 seems far too hard. He's only just learning how to recognize \"m\" and the game requires him to match whole words with small, unclear pictures.",
      "Although I thought the educational content of this game was great, it requires too much manual dexterity. This, not the instruction, was the source of my child's frustration. Many of the interaction points were extremely small. A lot of the time, this was clearly an intentional design choice. There was a ton of blank space on the screen, so the designers could have easily made buttons larger. Maybe this game is okay on s tablet, but it is unusable for a small child on a phone.",
      "Can't get on the trial - no support. I subscribed to get on the trial period having heard good things. The app says I haven't subscribed and wont let us do anything. I've on multiple occasions tried to contact reading eggs, only once receiving a reply, to which they asked for more information. I sent the requested info but heard nothing more, not even to my follow up prompt email. Cancelled my subscription before the payments started. Subscribed a month ago and no idea what the app is like"

But I have given 2 stars for the ones who are spoiling this app. Some bull**it people are there using this app who just write anything rubbish other than the answer for the question which you have asked. I started using this app for some time and I asked 4 questions relating to the subject. Out of those 4 questions, 2 answers which I got were just rubbish, they were of no use."

      "My chegg account was restricted due to \"unusual sctivity\" I have NEVER SHARED my account with anybody. I was told I would get an email within 48 hours. It is now about 4 days and no response. I cant log in. I called and the response I get is, \"our phone lines are currently close.\" I ask a question I get the message saying my account is restricted; and an email has been sent to reset the password. THERE IS NO EMAIL FROM CHEGG TO RESET THE PASSWORD. I HAVE TRIED INNUMERABLE TIMES! - NO SUCCESS.",
      "Great help for classes. It is really useful for us when we are having trouble and they help us out by prepping for tests",
      "It has been saying that I shared my account information when it is just me repeatedly googling my questions to get to the chegg solutions! I know I can search it on chegg but I seem to get to the solution more effectively when I Google it to get to the right chegg solution. Now, I can't get into my account when I need it the most. I spend nearly $20 a month for this!! I'm so frustrated.",
      "Unusual amount of activity even though i only use my phone. Locks me out regularly. UPDATE : It locked me out again because using two devices is considered account sharing. You can change your password as many times as you like, but if you plan on using chegg on a computer and your phone expect to get banned.",
      "I paid for the app, never got access. Emailed chegg and they told ME to deal with it and figure it out, and also to give them banking information over an email which i did not want to do so I just hoped they would deal with it. Emailed them MULTIPLE times to resolve the issue, and they took regular payments anyway. I paid for 2 months of subscriptions and did not receive ANY HELP from this app, or the support staff. Shame on you, Chegg. I would give zero stars if I could."

      "Really cool but the gps or whatever it runs off to know where you're pointing your phone at is slightly off. Like when pointing it at the moon it is just a little off of where it really is to where the app says it is. So makes it it more difficult to find the stars father away and or close together. Either way still a lot a fun and since my 7 yr old just recently really got into the whole astronomy thing for him it's a great app to play with.",
      "I can't track anything. No matter how much I turn to find a constellation in real time it constantly points east and won't stop zooming in and out. It is so frustrating! Unless it gets fixed soon I'm uninstalling and not coming back. Graphics are fine, notices and data are great but tracking needs to be fixed, urgently!",
      "Best star app in my opinion. I'm changing my review. For the last two months this thing has been all over the place. I pointed at the moon and there's nothing it says it's in the total other part of the sky, it's like the tracking doesn't work anymore I'm sick of it. This is no longer a reliable app",
      "Whenever I open the app, it seems that it is going to work properly then it goes pear shaped. For instance, it you point it at a star or planet, the star or planet on the app goes away from where it is actually in the sky.",
      "Pretty cool app. A lot of options and settings as a free app. Really accurate star seeking from phone. It notifies you when something pretty cool is going to happen, gives you time and then has an arrow that directs you as where to look. 10 STARS if I could."

Worth the 2 bucks for the added photos and no ads. The photos in the preview for the app though are not in this app. Which is one of the negatives.",

I do not recommend this game",

I haven't found a way to message both my daughters teachers and the family advocate at the same time. I have to copy and paste my message text twice if I need all three to see my it. If I forget to copy the original text before it's sent I have to retype it. It doesn't let me copy the text from a posted message.",

Will see till when they stay interested!",

    "description":"See the Earth as the astronauts see it with a 24/7 video livestream from the International Space Station.\r\n\r\nIf you like space or astronomy then you will love ISS Live Now.\r\n\r\nISS Live Now gives you easy access to a live video feed of Earth from the International Space Station, which is orbiting about 400 kilometers (250 miles) above the planet. The app provides an exciting experience marked by thoughtful design and features numerous customization options. \r\n\r\nWith ISS Live Now, you can view amazing live HD video streams directly from the International Space Station’s cameras.\r\n\r\nThe app utilizes the native Android Google Map (ISS tracker), which allows you to follow the Space Station’s orbit around our planet. You can zoom, rotate, drag and tilt the map; choose between different types of maps (such as satellite or terrain); and view data such as the speed of orbit, altitude, visibility, latitude and longitude, and even what country the Station is above at any moment in time. All of these options are easily customizable from the settings menu.\r\n\r\nYou will have seven different sources of live video streaming, including:\r\n\r\n1. Live HD camera: A wonderful HD video stream of our planet.\r\n2. Live standard camera: It shows a live stream of the Earth and, from time to time, details about the ISS (like tests, maintenance and communication with Earth).\r\n3. NASA TV: The television service of the United States government agency NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). You can watch science and space documentaries, interview with scientists, astronauts, engineers and personalities such as Elon Musk.\r\n4. NASA TV Media.\r\n5. Spacewalk (recorded): Beautiful HD images of astronauts from cameras outside the ISS.\r\n6. Inside the International Space Station: Take a video tour of each module inside the ISS, all explained by the astronauts.\r\n7. Eventual channel: Temporary live cameras from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) and the SpaceX.\r\n\r\nYou can also watch these live feeds on your television via Google Cast.\r\n\r\nYou even have the option to be notified when the next sunset or sunrise will occur, allowing you to watch it live directly from the International Space Station. \r\n\r\nDo you want to see the ISS in the sky at night? \r\nThis is the easiest way to spot the Station. With the built-in ISS detector tool, ISS Live Now will tell you when and where to look for the Space Station. You’ll receive a notification a few minutes before it passes by your location. \r\n\r\nYou can also choose to be notified when the ISS is about to pass over your region during the day, allowing you to admire your country from space.\r\n\r\nOther notification options include special events, such as spacewalks.\r\n\r\nExplore the International Space Station with Google Street View\r\n\r\nThanks to Google, aspiring astronauts can now simulate the experience of floating on the International Space Station (ISS). The company worked with astronauts to provide a Google Street View of the low-orbit satellite, from its science labs to its beautiful Earth-facing Cupola window. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nWhen the ISS (International Space Station) is on the night side of Earth, the video image is black, which is normal.\r\n\r\nSometimes, video is not available due to transmission issues, or because the crew is changing cameras. In such cases, you will usually have a blue or blank screen. In a few minutes the transmission should return, so, please be patient.

      "Not even a full HD stream, wow. The ISS has a 4k live stream camera, guys. I don't want to bash it, I love the idea, but it shouts and screams \"minimum effort\". I should also mention the ads that take 1/4 of the phone's screen. I'll go watch somewhere else until you decide you're doing this out of passion and not for money. Let's be honest, whoever is downloading this for long term use must be passionate about space. And yes, I know I could pay for ad free version, but this app is not worth it.",
      "I saw the ISS in the sky for the first time today thanks to this app. I was able to watch it fly over my house. Like a beautiful moving star. I knew exactly where to look for it thanks to the app. Absolutely brilliant. I loved being able to see this. I felt ridiculously excited knowing ISS was about to appear. It's unbelievable how fast it's going around the globe. The things in the menu are so interesting to watch as well and it makes seeing the ISS fly above you for real even more exciting❤️",
      "Ive had this great app for many years now and I love the view of the the Earth from the ISS , I do wish there were more down views of the Earth other that , I will watching this app from NASA for many years to come . The space walks are amazing to watch and the talks from the peaple in space are very educational to this old timer and my young daughter. One other thing I have to say is please keep up your great work that you are doing . Thank you .",
      "Okay, yes it works. And I paid to get rid of the ads as soon as it seemed to be working. I look forward to having at the Earth. Earth gazing. Spinning around. Staring at the ground. Maybe I will get to see a ufo someday. I pray.",
      "Love it but.... instead of notification of daylight notification, why not daylight and sunset in 5 minutes. They are often spectacular without prior notification."

      "The app is surprisingly accurate, I was scanning my dog a few times, who we were told is boxer with some hound mix in there, and the app got both those breeds consistently, though there were some breeds in the results that Josie is definitely not(though that's likely on me for bad photo quality) so thumbs up y'all, keep improving 😊",
      "I just installed this app & tried it on one of my Yorkies to see what it would say. (We have a very large Yorkie we adopted & thought he was mixed). Well the scanner only said he was Yorkie!! Either way we love him sooo much & didnt care no matter what. We were just curious. So then I tried on one of my pure breeds & same diagnosis❤👏👏👏. GREAT APP! Thanks guys for a great App. I dont think I would ever pay for a subscription though.",
      "Horrible I scanned my dog 3 timed just to see how real this is already knowing my dogs breed and this gave my dog 3-4 different breeds and it was all wrong each time not one single time did it add her breed in it. She's a blue nose pit nothing else and Definitely simple to guess even for non dog lover. #1 yeah definitely not lol. And you only get one star Because I'm Forced to give you at least one star to post lmao",
      "So cool very accurate. Absolutely love your app. I'm a big animal lover. This comes in handy when I pick up stray dogs. Lol. Seriously tho. Very accurate!",
      "It is fun and easy to use. I can not comment about the accuracy but it confirmed my guess. Without a DNA test we cannot be sure but the information specific to the possible breed is very good. It will help in the making of a kennel and play area for our puppy as the app guides us regarding the possible size she will be as a grown up dog."

The desired destination is Tenerife and we all heard that there are a lot of cool things to do around there. Prepare Bella for a great day and make sure you fulfill her needs like having a full stomach so her body could procure the necessary energy. You could buy new food items from the shop with the money you've earned in the playroom. A girl needs her best outfit to be able to go into the world, so check the store and equip her with crazy accessories and why not with a whole new look. Check the shoe item and choose the ones you like then get a suitable swimsuit for her so she could rock her look with a pair of sunglasses. Select a hairstyle that will combine perfectly with the final aspect. You've got these wonderful mini-games where you could gain money if you succeed to accomplish whatever the games ask. The bigger the score the greater the money, so try all of the games. The water slide from the resort is a lovely trip in a tub on top of the lifebuoy. Next, you've got the navigation on the lifebuoy where you have to keep Bella safe and protected from the other lifebuoys. There is a crazy game where you need to fit same bubbles of fish so they will burst together bringing you more money. After all this playing our girl needs to rest before she can conquer more territories in the water world. A quick nap is the best idea now and after you give her a shower, she will be able to get a good and revitalizing sleep. Look after her needs and if you have to go to the feeding part again, or any other phase that will make her requirements bars go full. There are a lot of surprising features that await to be discovered in this baby game.",

Tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times with no luck. I've waited patiently for a fix, but 4 or so months on and it's still broken. I've given up on it.",
      "LinkedIn learning is great, almost. The worst thing about it is trying to login through your organization or school. It just doesn't work and you have to sign in through the desktop site for it to work. The great thing about it is the ability to download courses. Sadly it's only for mobile and watching videos on a phone while working on my laptop suck. There is hope install BlueStacks on a computer and you can work from a dual monitor setup and it is a dream come true. Please make a desktop app.",

When we press the power button and the app is put on a different state, the position is lost. And when we go back to the app and click on \"keep watching\" the position is placed back to the position when we started the app, which is way before we watch. Please fix this. Thanks.",
      "The videos are good and educational. The issue I have is that after a few lessons completed, I was no longer able to add a new skill or lesson to my profile. I reached out to tech support and appeared to receive a response from a bot. I was instructed to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the problem and it didn't resolve the issue. When responding again about the unsatisfactory results, they closed the ticket."

      "I installed plantsnap probably about a year ago. I've used it every now and again and I've tried to identify at least 30 different plants, some of which I knew, just to check how the app is processing. I was hoping it would identify the unknown plants for me, but the accuracy of the app is marginal. Tbh I'm not sure now if it ever identified a correct plant. Idea is great, but functionality is disappointing. Certainly not buying premium.",
      "A few years ago I installed PlantSnap while on vacation, to attempt to identify local flora. While my wife is very knowledgeable (her uncle was a botanist), I was on my own and wanted to find an app that would do the identification and installed PlantSnap. Unfortunately, PlantSnap was useless back then (lots of promises but no follow-through) and unfortunately it is still severely lacking, today. Recently, I was invited to reinstall it. I even paid for the premium/pro version. It still can't identify the same plant it could not identify years ago, eventhough it promises there are \"thousands of folks around the world\" working to identify it. Their app lacks lots of basic functionality (it won't let me pick photos from anywhere but the Camera folder on my Samsung Note10+ and is not a \"share to\" target from any other photo/graphic/image browsing app - i.e. Google Photos, QuickPic, Samsung Gallery, etc). No options to turn off notifications (I posted a few recent photos using their FEED process and got sooo many notifications/comments, my phone was dinging like crazy - had to force turn off the notification via Android app settings). I emailed them 2-weeks ago about these issues and their auto-reply said \"Your satisfaction as a PlantSnap customer is important to us, and we are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to help!\" I have yet to receive any response at all.",
      "Stupid app just keep downloading files and using up memory. Even if I selected a photo from gallery the camera is on while it's identifying the photo. It should be online identification why should I carry the full data pack if I'm using online anyway to identify? It will ask your Google id, Facebook id or email to register with the app to use it too. At that moment felt like it's goal is to spy on me.",
      "Garbage. You only get 10 attempts at an ID each day. I'm sure if you pay for the app, you'd get unlimited, BUT...my issue is that I have NEVER ONCE gotten an ACCURATE identification! I tried over the course of several days, all 10 attempts each day were wrong and still ate up 1 of the 10 attempts for the day.",
      "I really wanted to fall in love with this app, but I can't. As a test run, I took pictures of some of the most easily identifiable plants I have(creeping fig and a spider plant) and then app couldn't identify either. I had clear pictures in well-lit rooms as well."

      "This is absolutely amazing! I've tried many other similar apps. This one shows you the constellations and even the overlying drawings to help kids (and adults) picture why the constellations have the names they do. Truly remarkable! It even those you constellations when they are not visible due to clouds, through your ceiling, and even those on the other side of the globe! Just phenomenal !!!",
      "Absolutely amazed!! 🙂 Thanks for creating this app, this is what I really need, I have a habit of staring the stars during a weekend break on the province with less light polution. It helps me to locate the moon, constellations and identify unknown shining objects. At first I was in doubt then I tried this on both morning and evening and I am amazed with the results, the moon, sun and other stars are exactly on the same spot. Amazing. I wouldn't regret purchasing the full version. Thank you 😊",
      "LOVE it! Its full 360 degree view of the cosmos names any object with a brief description. It shows the trajectory and accurate location of objects (even man made ones) . Im 50 and a scientist and this app still impresses me. It's just ...neat to point it down at the ground and know where the sun is tonight😊. Great education tool.",
      "Not bad, but there are better. One of the minor annoyances is that the FAQs show the answers bot the question, and when you click it then it shows the question, but the answer doesnt fit in the box. Such as \"How do I calibrate?\".",
      "This app is having major issues the last few months. At first I thought it was my phone, but tried my second phone and I have the same bearing issues. I am mot sure if I want to make the upgrade purchase now. Too bad, it was awesome when I first got it"

      "This app is amazing! I just started and I learned so much within 15 mins. The interface for the app is quite easy to understand and deal with. It makes the user's learning experience an enjoyable one. This app would most definately be my first recommendation to anyone else that really wants to get serious learning the importance of coding and the benefits they can aquire from doing so. Kudos to the creators of this app it really is a great one.",
      "I love this app! I have only been using it for less than an hour and its amazing. Although I wish some of the pro features were free, I can always just use another app to practice on playground. This app has already taught me so much and it's very addicting. Before I know it, I will be a coding master! Thank you, Mimo :)",
      "It's a great app. I'm using it for game development (which is a pro course) and it helped me a lot. Gonna publish my game soon on this platform because of it ;) But I do hate how you can't write the code yourself. It gives you choices almost, but you never write the code yourself. You'll have to just observe and test on your own project. That's why I'm deducting a star.",
      "Mimo has excellent lessons and projects and competitions and streaks that guide your learning at your own pace but encourage you to maximize it. The pro version is worth the annual £20 as it allows further development of each section and the creative projects to show you what you can do with your skills. If you are not new to HTML, this might not be as useful, since you have to complete all the basics before getting on to anything difficult but it is a superb app for beginners!",
      "I'd more or less give a 3.5-3.75 stars, but I can't. The reason being I've noticed on some tasks it would leave out information. When I go to correct it with the new information I am given; after I've gotten it wrong. 50% of the time it would say I was right. 50% of the time it would say I'm wrong. Please add all information to your tasks."

      "Good app. Only a few games are free but they are enough to give you a good challenge. The ads are a bit annoying when free but not enough to stop me enjoying the game as they are between games not during. I like the daily challenge which gives a selection of the available games and tracks your progress. If I wanted to pay for a brain training app I would probably go ahead with this one.",
      "I deleted it within like six minutes of downloading it from an ad. Did 5 generic puzzles and got results telling me where I stand with other people. Whether these are true I couldn't tell you, but I imagine that's one of the features making this app attractive - the potential of feeling evaluated. The funny thing about this app is you go through the initial set of puzzles, then it forces you to set reminders to play it, and then says you need to pay or wait a day to play again. I wasn't going to",
      "Will rate it 4. So far the game is ok. But I have a problem with \"Baggage Claim\". After playing the mini game, when you have to find the cities you memorized, the screen is a little bit too low, therefore I can only see four choices and I can't find the submit button. I will certainly give it a five if my problem is fixed",
      "Love this app. My only issue is with \"Baggage Claim\". For some reason the list of cities drops to the bottom of my screen and I can only ever see the top two options and am therefore limited to the number I can select that I remember. I know it's not meant to do this because the first time I ever played the \"mini game\" it functioned fine, but now does not. The list of cities to remember and the secondary task (alphabetizing, selecting the bag, and clicking the letters) always works fine.",
      "I love peak and have noticed some small changes with memory, concentration, and reflexes. My only complaint is, lately, Grow hasn't been working like before. I have to click a few buttons to get to keypad since it goes to numbers first and it doesn't type(even though my phone is indicating it is). Please fix that. Otherwise, I like it!! *Gboard helped! Thanks!"

      "Dude, Your app definitely deserves 5 star but for now I am giving ut 3 stars as there is a lack of one imp. feature in this app and i.e Please add a deadline and countdown of Goal, like when we set our goal it should ask us for the deadline and then whenever we open the app and start to manifest then it should show the countdown of the days. I hope you will add this imp. feature as soon as possible and i am also waiting to give it 5 star 😃",

    "comments":[
      "It is a very good application but it doesn't bring things from q new dimension daily. Just the same thing over and increase in the level of difficulty but that might not necessarily be a bad thing because practicing a thing over and over again helps you improve and be better. It helps you organize your thoughts and concrete. I would recommend that you download it and not only that ensure you use the app daily, with time you would notice the improvement you have made.",
      "It's been a roller coaster ride, I've been on and off Lumosity over the years and every time I find my way back I slowly start to see improvement in certain aspects of my life. It makes me wonder what parts of game theory are mlinked into Lumosity. Furthermore, I'm grateful to the creators of Lumosity. I hope somehow it can become a standard test for middle school",
      "I give it a 3 instead of a 4 because there is a drawback. Yet, it is a great thinking game, as well as an enjoyable way to learn. The drawback is that unless you buy a \"monthly membership\", you are at their mercy on which games you can play. This limits you to the three they have chosen for the day. You have the option to replay the games of the day.",
      "Ive been playing for least 12 years, and I have had a premium subscription. I really do enjoy it I would recommend it as a way to pass the time, especially if you want to paly something more mentally enhancing than PVZ (Guilty!) It keeps my memory sharp and its odd to notice when it does work, but when it does, you know it. Disullision and Train of Thought is also a personal fave. If they would allow your insights and maybe show you where you need improvement for free users I would give it 5",
      "Love it but would find it even more fun, if the list of scores were dated...none could then investigate/retrace especially poor or excellent scoring days. Also, since word games are my favorites, I'd love to find out how more of those could be presented me on my training days as opposed to the simply visual brain gymnastics, that my eyes find quite difficult and tiring. THANKS!"
