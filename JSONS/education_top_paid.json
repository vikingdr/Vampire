      "I find this app very good, the constellation arts are accurate, and it also provides information on stars. Only problem I found is, it doesn't have images of objects other than stars and planets in the information section. For example, Andromeda and Sombrero galaxy. This information is helpful when I'm stargazing through a telescope and need to find these objects. Also the angle of view of the sky is very low. Most of the time, I can't see a complete constellation in one screen.",
      "Love it! Big help in locating specific stars, planets, constellations, meteor showers, you name it. Beats the heck out of trying to identify things using just a book. When I got my current phone, I installed quite a few astronomy apps and tried them all, thinking I'd keep the top three and use all three for maximum information and different perspectives. After a few days, I found myself using this app exclusively. Don't need anything else... Just make sure you calibrate it right.",
      "Each time I get a new phone, I always try at least two other, new to me, sky map apps, I always come back to this one. It's easy to use. Their screen is stable making it essy to mark the object of interest. There isn't clutter all over the screen. All the information needed is right on the screen. I love this app and it's worth the upgrade. A solid five star app.",
      "Still not fixed. I have my location on! I jave calibrated as they said. This app would be great IF it said I was pointing in the right direction. i am pointing north and it thinks im between south and south east. Please fix this! I hoped buying this app would make it more accurate but nope. I shouldnt have bought this. Terrible with proper direction.",
      "Yesterday I was at my friend's house, and we were discussing if he'd have sun on his balcony during the summer. With this app I turned back the time to June, found the sun and showed him the trajectory with the AR view. He was stunned. I love this application, it allows me to explore the universe and inspire others. The design is minimalist, yet flexible and full of useful features. I've tried several similar applications, but this one is my go-to ❤️"

      "Wonderful game. Very cute art style. The gameplay is fun and well worth the 4 bucks I spent on it. My kid plays it for a couple of days and then she redownloads it a couple of months later to play again and she's been doing this for 2 years now! :) Most importantly, there are no ads and no in-app purchases after you buy the game. Great job guys!",
      "i love this game but some time it does not work correctly but it stops if i don't play the game for a while. when i grow up i want to do hair so it is so fun to be able to paly this game! i wish though that there was more options when you do there hair and i wish there was more people in the game. i learned about this game form my friend and whenever i go to her house that is all i wanted to do. but in 2019 for christmas i got a touch screen computer and all i have done is play it! thank you!!!",
      "Great app is it's fun, you can desging boys or girls. There are accessories, outfits, and more. there are so many backdrops and they look so cool. There is barely any ads for me I had no ads yet. Only thing I would want to say that is bad is tieing hair it's really hard to tie hair up in ponytails or buns. You can also dye hair. If you like doing other people's hair you should get this app. You also can't get bored easily.",
      "I really like this game but you should make it where your pictures actually save to your device so you can look at them later. I wish it was easier to make the hair look like its up in a ponytail or bun. You should also add makeup and more girl outfits that are cute and to change the color of eyes and to dye eyebrows. If you add these things i will like this game more and rate 5 stars. So theres a lot of things you should add but its still a fun game to play and make hairstyles.",
      "Works perfectly, I have never had a problem with this app. It is very creative and cute! It has no ads or in app purchases. This app allows my imagination to roam, and is very stress reducing."

      "The app was fun at first, but i kept playing it throught the day and finished it when it became dark out so i completed it in about 6 hours since i only played like 10 to 20 minutes per lets say 2 hours and once i finished it became useless.I couldnt do anything it was boring, so i suggest you dont buy this app if your kid asks you to get it for them .",
      "I really do like this game I always wanted it but I would suggest being able to mix the elements together to make the game longer it is short but that is because it is super addictive at the start over all amazing game just hoped it would longer",
      "It was fun at first! But after playing for a while more, it got boring. I realised that unlocking all the elements took a shorter time (1h) than I had expected. Therefore, it wasn't as fun as I thought before I downloaded the game. It became boring as I didn't have anything else left to play. However, the game is interesting and engaging. I would like the game to last longer next time and not tell us how to unlock the other elements. I prefer to find out how to do so by myself.",
      "This game was fun! But it needs an update. Please add elements 119-172 , Custom elements and molecules. and boring bug fixes.",
      "Can you fix that if you refund it so it gives back the money that you spent on the game because my brother was playing on my phone and he uninstalled the game and I was sad so please fix that and I will buy this game and some other games by you guys too. : ) That's the reason I gave it 3 stars : ("

      "Hi i like this game because of the secret hideout and the hospital stuff but i wish something cool happened when you find and put all the sloths inside the tank i was very dissappointed when nothing happened because i thought something would happen. I thought you could actually have a character have a baby in this game like give birth but you just change the clothes to make it look not pregnant and then pick up a baby. 😑",
      "Make it possible to cure sick patients in the app. The app is a great for kids going through the hospital system or kids who experienced hospital stays. The adult version allows the player to make patients sick, but the kid version does not, so it's less effective than it could be for kids who use the app to come to terms with their experience. Letting kids who have been through the hospital system play the adult version can traumatize due to the inability to cure patients once they're sick.",
      "I love this game!! Amazing for kids and teens. This game makes you go from bored to happy! You can operate on people, get cured and its like a real hospital. 5 stars!!!",
      "My children love the Toca games and asked for this one. Unfortunately I can't seem to add it to Family Library which is disappointing as it means I've bought it on my phone but they can't play it on their tablets. All other Toca games have added successfully.",
      "It was a good game but I recommend not getting it because it's just a hospital and no homes and nothing?? So it was an ok games, but there is just no homes and no park there was no way you could leave.. So yeah. I don't recommend this if you get bored easily."

They're getting older now, but still revel in the knowledge they've received from Stack the States.

      "So far seems very functional, with the exception of one very annoying bug: whenever I try to search for an object in the free-look mode, the screen will flicker/stutter constantly with some random still frame and is extremely frustrating to deal with. Don't know if it's something wrong with mine personally because I don't seem to see anyone else having the same issue but it's very annoying. Hope it gets fixed soon.",
      "One month ago I initially downloaded the app to conttrol my telescope set up: Skywatcher Star Discovery 150 Syn Scan Wi Fi AZ Go To. It initially didn't quite work with my scope. However the support I received was unbelievable. Over the next version (within 2 weeks, over the Christmas and New Year holidays) the issue was technically fixed, something which took years for other apps. Obviously there is some very dedicated team working to develop a great app. I like also the approach in this app in comparison to other similar apps - its very sleek and user friendly design and the team's keen interest to develop it into a true digital astronomical assistant to amateurs. Would be very keen to follow the developments of this irreplaceable astronomical tool.",
      "Stellarium Mobile Plus is amazing!! i have tried other free/purchased astronomy apps, and this one has superior functionality, larger catalog of objects with a user friendly search feature for clusters, messier objects, stars and planets. i love the zoom in/out and was able to locate objects like ic1101, and view objects names from various historical cultures. the only thing I asked for was the ability to toggle kilometers to miles, and my email received a reply within a few hours. i have",
      "Awesome app I am using this frequently for stargazing, however I think the rendering the object names in regional language is a missing feature. The desktop app have an option to display the regional names for stars and planets which is missing here. The names of the object are fine but the script is still English.",
      "I've been an occasional amateur astronomer since the 1980s. This is my first use of an e-Star Atlas and I must say that this app is amazing, very well thought out, extremely easy to navigate with very responsive zooming and an intelligent menu system. It's also a wonderful mobile teaching tool for introducing newcomers to celestial and planet motion, (using the time slider), constellations, DSOs etc. On my Samsung S9 phone the active tracking after calibration works perfectly. Very well done!"

      "I love most toca Boca games. This one is just a total rip off. Ok so I saw the picture of four apartments and was like, Yas! But when I got in it only had two apartments, and I only had half the characters as they said I would have. When went back to get a refund that option was gone. If you guys want me to change the rating then either give me a refund, or update the game. And there is a luegie board behind the painting. Is that really apropriate for 6 year olds?",
      "Great! 4 floors as they promised, and all the characters! I just love hus, i love how there are boxes so you dont get others to hold your things......i recommend 5his, totally worth your money and time.",
      "I love this game, so many apartments to choose from. The cafe is AWSOME, and there are even some secrets (suprises) too! If you haven't played this game yet, you should try it, it's amazing!",
      "This app works just fine! And adding it to toca world is fun to! I like the apartment and the restraunt. The restraunt is bright and colorful and exciting! And the apartment is small but fun to interact and roleplay with. I like how two floors can feel like four because of the rooms. This app is simple yet so fun. Like all the toca life games.",
      "Hmmm it is fun, I ❣️ it. But, sometimes I get a bit bored. I watch videos and they have different stuff. They look fun but cost money. I get mad I just play this game to be good.."

      "Like the game, GREAT concept but for 3.99 I was expecting more. More levels, more pets, more opportunity for game play. I am very disappointed with this game as games that cost around this amount generally take longer than 10 minutes to reach the end point. It would be nice to hear what my 3.99 went towards if its not for the game itself.......... will be uninstalling :(",

      "I thought it was very fun to play this. It gave your character a nice house, a court system, a five star diner, a place to leave your kid and even a super cool job with an awesome hidden secret in the bosses office. (If you want to find it, look in the top 4 cupboards in his room. They will give you a useful password",
      "Whenever I try to open the app, it just takes me out of it and back to the homescreen. I've tried rebooting and reinstalling the app, but doesn't work. If you ask me, I'd say it's a waste of money.",
      "*PLEASE FIX THIS BUG* I rated four stars only because, 1. It wasn't perfect, which is fine. And 2. Because I had to reboot my device because when I tried to drag a person somewhere, they wouldn't go anywhere, all they would do is hop up a little. After I rebooted, I got back on, and after about 5 minutes, it happened again. You couldn't interact with anything, or drag. Please fix this bug so that I can enjoy this game again!",
      "My brother was trying to play Toca office and it is asking for us to send feedback and I tried and it didn't work so can you plz tell us and if you tell us how to fix it I will give 5 stars but my brother is very sad because he paid money to get Toca office and he can't even play it",
      "I really like this app, but I deleted it once so it would update. Then when i tried to download it again, it comes up with an error message. This is also with the Toca Life Pets and Toca City. I have those apps still, but they won't update. They just come up with an error message too. So I don't know if this is a device issue, or a game issue, but I would like if you could please try to fix it. Thank you!"

      "Hi Toca Boca! I love your apps, including this game. I have a few suggestions for updates too. You could add one or two houses to this game, because where do the characters go after their vacations? Also, you could add a waterpark too. I also have a few app ideas, Toca Life Daycare/Kindergarten, and Toca Life Zoo! I hope these will become actuall games soon. Thanks Toca Boca!",

      "It might be ok as a study tool, but it's rather unprofessionally developed. Many of the questions and answers had grammar and spelling mistakes, and some of them relied on picture references which couldn't be reliably interpreted. Definitely not worth the price.",
      "Great app, has all the info you need to pass the test. I was able to pass on the first try with all 30 questions correct.",
      "Two questions in their practice test are flat out wrong and I knew it but answered them on the test the way practice test had them anyway and got two wrong on the actual test because this product I paid for wasnt properly gone through before release. Even the DOJ website itself isnt up to date on the laws pertaining to those two questions. That's pretty unprofessional. The question about gun buying age and what line of safety is a safety were both botched in practice test and differ from actual.",
      "Great Study Guide! Just passed my test with flying colors. Would have got 100 on my test but one question has not been updated yet. New law in California as of January 1, 2019 states you must be 21 to buy a rifle. Was 18 years of age. I'll take 29 out of 30. Thanks again. A good investment if you plan to purchase any firearms in California.",
      "Lol this test is definitely not the same as what is actually given and in fact is much harder than the test.  Still going thru it gives you a thorough knowledge to easily pass the test"

It said it was compatible with all my devices until AFTER I bought it, and then there was a message like, \"This might not be optimized for your device.\" What a scam. Now I have to put this stupid thing I bought for my daughter on my stupid phone and feel, you know, like I'm a stupid person.",
      "I love this game cause this app is very creative and it makes children intrest in playing and gettin creative on writing stories and creative writing i am 12 years old and still play this cause it really improved my imagination",
      "I think this game is great! I bet alot of people were so happy for you to make it free. But I have 2 things to talk about: Toca Mix and Toca Farm. So, my Galaxy Tab A (it's Samsung) can get Toca farm for free, but I don't know if Apple users can. Please don't remove that if you made it, I just wanted to mention that if Apple users need to pay 5.49 for it and us it's free, I think it's unfair. And now for Toca mix. Google Play (Samsungs have it) don't have Toca Mix yet, but I think you should get it in our stores as soon as you can! I notice that Apple gets a preview, but I think you should've gotten it for everyone. And I think you should make it free so we can connect it to Toca Town. Well, thank you for reading! I'm bringing NO hate just so you know!",
      "The very first of the Toca Life games, right here. Toca Life: Town is excellent. Well designed locations. Cute and fun characters. Why not give it a try? It's quite small, though. But that shouldn't stop you from exploring this well created game!"

      "It is good and I played it since I was five It has horses and stores your horse can be in a race with another horses. There's a forest. There's something cool and a surprise in the Water fontin ☺🏇",
      "This game is soooooooooooooooooooo nice👍 I have spent 25 bucks on it 💸💸I love it so much and I love pretend play games😀 so one day I saw toca boca and I was like yes😉❤. But there is one question how do you take a video please let me know🎬🎥. But one more thing make some of the things for free because some people want to buy games but they don't have the money anyway💶☝ I love toca boca you guys made this game GOATED amazing job😆. And ignore the haters I love toca.💜💛💚💙❤💟👏👏👏",
      "Very educational for children that are wanting to work in a stable! Good job, Toca Boca. The graphics are perfect, but I recommend to stop making apps with purchases. Because just for a game? But not disappointed pals! Good job! Five stars for ya!",
      "I love this game, but there is a glitch. One of the characters, well, you'd think he'd have legs, but, they're invisible, or, otherwise, he has none. I know you put them in in Toca Life: World, but, I wish you did it in the original. Anyways, I love the Toca Life series, and I'm a big fan of it. Keep making new locations for Toca Life: World!",
      "😱😀 How do I start saying this-- THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING!! I have always been a fan of these games they are so cute and I can always make great stories!!😀It would be great though if people could interact with others like one on one and maybe even have actual horse competitions to go to where they could compete against other players ! Other than that the game is lovely keep up your great work.❤❤❤"

      "NORMALCDF FUNCTION DOEA NOT WORK RIGHT. Purchased and wasted 3.99",
      "I can't stress enough how streamlined the ui is in the app. It's so much faster than the regular (150 dollar) calculator, and is in color. Tracing lines on the 2d grid is so much faster and less tedious, going through menus is so much more intuitive, and the speed of all of the calculations are lightning fast. For 4 dollars, this BETTER IN EVERY WAY calculator is an absolute steal of an app. It's like upgrading from a flip phone to a next gen phone, cheaper than the flip phone. Get it!!!!",
      "I recommend this app to all of my statistics students. So, thank you and keep up the good work! I do have a request, though. Is it possible to add a feature to change the bin size for histograms? Right now, you can zoom in and out, but doing that does not change the bin size. Thank you again for your fine work!",

The tests are helpful, as far as they go, but the real value here is the community contributed explanations of the questions and answers. As someone that is very far removed from his Elmer, this was utterly invaluable.",
      "This app is great. I'm studying for my general, and love that this app allows focused element study, and metrics on performance. I chose a single element and studied until I got my percentage above 82%, and then moved on to the next element. Very helpful app!",
      "Great app! Went from zero knowledge of ham radio, to easily passing the Technician exam in only a few weeks. The app does a great job of reviewing the exam questions, while also explaining the answers. This app has taught me a lot. Will continue to use it for the General exam. Well worth the price!",
      "Decided I wanted to go for my license. Found this app; had great reviews and app is very well designed. Utilizing just the app, in a two week period, I was able to cram enough information into my brain to pull a hat trick and passed all three tests at once. I am now an Extra and I thank this app!"

      "Well--you did it again, Toca Boca. But, what's there not to like about this game?The characters are fun, new, crazy and cool. Chill out in your apartment if you like--but there's lot to do! Mix beats-- or dance instead! Well--if that's not your type, you can play sports! Still no? You can go skating. Not that? No need to go far, you can paint here too! Well... if you've rejected all those you can get a snack... Or maybe you should stay in your apartment and chill.",
      "Amazing game, Toca Boca! So glad! I don't even think that there should be more levels because in most of the levels, there are four rooms! If you were to add in another level in a future update, maybe you could add in a clinic for injured students, empty classrooms, etc. Thank you 🙃",
      "Wow, amazing. Absolutely great game. Intriguing for kids of all ages. Lovely things to do like make music, score a goal, paint a picture, eat a salad, do a skateboard trick, play a arcade game and so much more. One of the best games yet. Can't wait to play toca life neighbourhood.",
      "awesome game . I love it . the only reason why I did not give it five stars is because it won't come up on my toca life world .😭 all of my other games have AKA neighbourhood school hospital pets and office. please can you fix this issue Toca Boca . also I don't think it is fair that this is for ages 6 to 8 . I am ten and adore these games ."

      "A great app that helps me out when I'm doing astrophotography. Really easy to use (although the time stamp is very sensitive). Great pictures when zoomed in. I really prefer this over another well known star app! Updated review March 2020. I still love this app!",
      "I'm going to have to uninstall this app. It's just so frustrating, trying to go back a page is impossible. Tapping all over the screen produces no 'go back or return' symbol.",
      "Really good the add-ons are really good not gonna lie noticed a change when I got them if you into interstellar space and stars would recommend getting",
      "Beware. I bought this primarily for 2 of its advertised features: Star Spotter, which allows you to point your phone at the sky and get a live representation of the sky which moves with the phone, and Augmented Reality where the image from your camera will be overlaid with the app-generated sky, allowing you to know what is right above you. Neither of these features is available on my device, a) because it doesn't have a built in magnetometer in the hardware - a Moto G7 play running Android 9, and b) it seems the Augmented Reality function is only available on Apple devices. However, you don't find this out until you have purchased the app and its add-ons. Should be made clear before purchase that the two key features might not work on many devices. Apart from that, there are other issues. The map of the night sky is nice and updated in real time, however, many of the stars have little or no information about them, and clicking on information will only bring up a generic script telling you what a star is: thanks, I know already. Many of the deep space objects turn out to be poor blurred images when zoomed-in on.",
      "Perfect if you are a fan of astronomy. The UI is seamless. The graphics is out of this world and very engaging. The amount of celestial bodies mentioned is mind boggling. You are search for an object in the sky where you are pointing your phone. It keeps you informed about latest astronomical events."

      "I know that I keep asking you this, but you should make your games free. It's not fair on those who don't wanna waste their money on an app. If you don't consider making your apps free, maybe you could lower the prices at least. Overall, I do like the game, and there's so many pets to choose from! I think you should add character creator to all the Toca Life apps too though. What would also be great, is if you could add more locations! Maybe add more apartments? Thanks anyway Toca Boca!",
      "I had this game for 2 years and i'm still in LOVE with it!! The reason I gave it 3 stars is because there is only a few locations and I don't really think it is worth $3.99 and this game should be free but overall, its a good game!",

I also wish you can make a quiz where you say what country the capital shown up top it belongs to and put the capital. Everything else is SO good. I think you should give this game a 5 stars/5 stars. Get this game today!",
      "I love this app, it is fun for both kids and adults, I love learning about all of the different countries and perfer this app to stack the states because it has more play value. I wish that Central America was its own part and you could merge the states into this app to make one superapp. I hope that you would charge the same price for it, though. 2.99 is a little more than I would like to spend, but I had a $2 credit from the app store and thought this was a perfect thing to buy. I love this!",
      "A great game for everybody. Children as well as adults. I would rate it 5 stars if either the app itself or another from Dan Russel Pinson had some more geographical features to play with. Rivers, lakes, mountains...or capitals, landmarks. Anyway, the best computer game I know!",
      "Great app for your child to learn about geography which is something I don't think they teach enough of in school. Some questions are a little hard but they do repeat & with that repitition they pick it up fast. My 5 yr old loves this game & has learned a lot about our country & others."

    "description":"With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \r\n\r\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\r\n\r\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\r\n\r\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\r\n\r\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \r\n\r\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is  masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\r\n\r\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\r\n\r\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\r\n\r\nSo, what will you serve today?\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Us:\r\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "It's great! I love it. It is a bit too expensive but good. I want ti have machine upgrades like when you start using the smoothie maker it is not really good at making smoothies but when you upgarde it to the max it works really good. You upgrade the machines by money that you earn from custormers. Hope you add the upgrade machine update.",
      "This game is amazing!!! My sister loves making new sushi every day we make it together.it would be great if you could put in more better reactions as every time you serve them there sushi it's the same every time but that's no really a major thing to worry about.Also I would say that the price is a little high I think that it should be about £2.99.last thing if the creators could maybe put in a bit more things into the game that would also be great but again nothing really to worry about.",
      "It gets boring after awhile. Wish you could make drinks and have way more stuff and characters. Please add more interactive things.",
      "I can see why this has 4.9 stars! It deserves 100000000000000000000000000000000000 stars <3 This is the best Toca Kitchen app by far! ;D You can roll up the sushi practically any way, make fun food shapes, choose your outside (seaweed, lettuce, and a couple of Unknown substances- maybe meat and dough?), and discover fun reactions from each customer! :3 Be aware, you can't choose your customer- they come in on their own. But, you can go to the serving area and kick them out- that's the only way to make them go, but when you make them go at the end of a meal, I see it as leaving, not _making_ them leave. To change your wrapper, simply go to the wrapping place and tap on it. It goes in the order: seaweed, lettuce, dough?, and meat?. Anyway, despite the price, this is like, the best sushi app EVER! You guys should totally get this. Yes, I'm aware this review is really long, I just have so many positive things to say about this app... Lol. :3 Bye now, tho.",
      "You could spend a solid HOUR cooking and plating a dish on this game and get one out of the like seven reactions you could just as easily get from setting a wholeass WATERMELON on a plate and calling it good. Initially I thought it was just a better, sushi-themed version of Toca Kitchen 2, but in reality the customers in this app are very 1-dimensional. They are physically incapable of expressing displeasure regarding the food. Not very rewarding, tbh"

PURCHASE ONCE, USE FOR A CAREER!  PDG PROmote provides lifetime free updates.  Why should you have to pay for a new app every time the study guides are updated?  You don’t pay $0.99 for these apps.  You deserve lifetime updates.  We know that your promotion is important to you but that doesn’t give us the right to take advantage of it.  Should the Air Force resume testing for the SNCO ranks in the future, rest assured that we will include those ranks in the app too.\r\n\r\n2. OUR QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLY BETTER.  Many of our users have commented to us that our questions aren't as simplistic as other apps.  They make you think a little more. The actual exam seemed easier.  PDG PROmote provides TOTAL COVERAGE of the AFH 1 based study guides.\r\n\r\n3. OPTIMIZE YOUR LIMITED STUDY TIME.  You have a full-time job.  We know you need to get the most out of your limited study opportunities.  PDG PROmote makes it easy for you to maximize the effectiveness of your study sessions.  Our Intelligent Test Engine automatically prioritizes the questions you need to study.  You can further maximize your efficiency by choosing to study or test by ADTC.\r\n\r\n4. BEING SKILLED IS WHAT MATTERS.  We originally launched PDG PROmote in 2011.  We are proud of the fact that it became the #1 selling PDG / AFH 1 study guide app after only 4 years.  Our ability to extract important information and formulate great questions is second to none.  Our success comes from our ingenuity, our competence, our processes, our work ethic, and our attention to detail.  If we needed years and years of experience to master a document that you are being asked to master in mere months you probably wouldn’t want to use our app.\r\n\r\n5. INTUITIVE DESIGN.  PDG PROmote is simply the most intuitive and least frustrating AFH 1 study guide you will find.  Experience the difference a great designed app can make.\r\n\r\n6. AUDIO QUESTIONS.  Yes, we use synthetic audio and not a real human voice but we include it in the app for free.  It’s a popular feature that many of our users use on their drive to and from work.\r\n\r\n7. DON’T BE TRICKED INTO PAYING SKY HIGH PRICES!  You will be accused of selling yourself short.  Don’t believe it.  You will be asked to pay a small fortune for their \"experience\".  Just remind yourself that you are being tested on a handbook (AFH 1) dated 1 October 2019, not 1987.  You can easily find Airmen who have used our app and scored high.  THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.  Our users pay two or even three times less, get the same or better results, and get free lifetime updates.  Doesn't that sound wise to you?\r\n\r\nNOW ON MAC AND PC!  Go to http://forcereadiness.com/pdg-promote-pdg-study-guide to learn more.\r\n\r\nPDG PROmote is an application aimed to prepare Airmen who are taking the Air Force Promotion Fitness Examination (PFE) or the USAFSE-United States Air Force supervisory examination. Its sole source of reference is The Study Guide for Promotion to (SSgt, TSgt), 1 October 2019.  All study guides are sourced from Air Force Handbook 1 (AFH 1) dated 1 October 2019.

      "The app constantly crashes when I try to resume a test, I've sent multiple emails without a single response, and even the basic grammar in the questions is off frequently. If it gets me promoted, great, but I shouldn't have to pay for something that doesn't work properly and was so rushed that the wording of questions don't make sense.",
      "Great study material to get ready for the big test, some tie-in to other questions and sort of gives the answer for a previous question. Only gripe is that it's REALLY boring, hard for a young airman to docus and read through 20 questions to absorb the knowledge(hands-on leaenee and gamer). Also, I'm not a fan about how the answers are on the same side as the question; my eyes just can't help but read the answer first most of the time. And yes I tried using an answer cover.",
      "How many minutes before the app closes out. I'm trying to study all 2000+ questions in sequential order but if I take a break (while keeping my phone on).......it restarts from scratch. What kind of sense does that make. I was 200 something questions in and now have to restart. I want to only see new questions before seeing the ones I know and have answered",
      "Good questions, but it doesnt save any progress for tests. You better finish all 90 questions in one sit through or in an hour you'll have to start over.",
      "I can't seem to find anyway to get the audio to work. Besides that it seems pretty good."

On my device (OP 6), the gyroscope is never correct for pointing the screen and identifying stars, but that's probably my device and not the app. However, Stellarium would get my fifth star if it were able to turn the button area black. Even in night mode, the background for the home & back buttons is white, defeating the purpose of night mode.",
      "Very nice app, maybe the best of it's kind besides one flaw. Why when you view a full moon does it completely wash out the rest of the sky? This app shouldn't be taking realism to extremes such as that. I want to explore the sky but the second the moon comes into view it completely blankets everything. At least make this optional, unless I've missed it in the settings?",
      "Only astronomy app I actually paid for. Good all around app for what it is. That being said for an app you have to pay for, the GPS does not work even remotely well. I live in Montana one of the least populated states in the USA we have incredibly dark skies. When I know for fact I'm looking toward Jupiter it says I'm looking at the sun. Can be extremely frustrating as I paid for this and have yet to use it's full potential. Really hope the next update corrects these issues.",

      "Best study guide app. Passed the 5 and the 6 board thanks to this app. Totally worth it.",
      "It's definitely ok, the MOI option that was discussed in an earlier review hasn't been implemented yet (at least I don't think so). Offers a generic guide to studying which should be helpful for some.  Unsure of the feasibility of adding a form of game-like elements in the future as another review stated. Overall though a pretty decent buy and it gets 4 stars for the frequent updates and ease of use.",

      "I think this app is appropiate, not just for kids, but for all ages. It makes you think about what is possible in this world. This game has challenge and it makes think about \"Ok, how am I going to make this work?\" Nothing is going to go 100% smoothly and I really appreciate this game for that. Though I dislike the block limitation and one time, the back button wasnt working so when I opened the game again that world was gone. Though It is a great game and I would reccomend it to everyone",
      "My son, 6 years old, enjoys that game. He builds and builds and builds. The controls seem to be very handy. He is quick with them.",
      "I absolutely love Toca Boca games, but this was quite a disappointment. 😔 The controls are quite strange and hard to manage, and I still don't quite understand how to use them. It's very difficult to create anything and it's extremely tedious having to constantly switch between characters. Since it has been a few years, I would be curious to see a remake of this game. I'm sure the developers have improved a lot in the past few years, so I would definitely be interested to how it would turn out.",
      "This is a great game you can build anything you want this game may cost money but its worth it",
      "it's a really slow game , and I created a really cool world , it said it had saved and when I went back on it, the game had deleted my world !!! 😠 I want a refund"

      "We absolutely love this game! My 5 and 7 year olds never seem to get tired of it. Actually, we love all of the Avokiddo apps - definitely worth the small fee to purchase, and customer service is excellent.",
      "we love this app",
      "Great and fun interactive game that kids love. Another very important note is that avokiddos games runs great on low power devices. A lot of games lag on my daughters tablet, but these games runs super smooth. Keep up the good work.",
      "Love your apps but my 4 yr old is screaming because I bought the wrong one, says he wanted the monster one. Please help!",
      "This is my 1st Avokiddo app, as most of the apps I get are from Pepi, Dr. Panda, Toca Boca n some other similar developers.  This game is great! It runs smoothly n I have not had any issues.  There's plenty to do w the 4 animals.   If it can keep her giggly but quiet, its a win win for the both of us.  Thanks for making this funny and entertaining!"

      "I dont really write any reviews to your apps, but I felt like I should've for this game because it's AMAZING. I love that you made this free and that there are so many locations to role play in. I do think you should make more of your games free, or just lower the prices because three dollars is quite a lot for most people. And I'm not the only one who thinks so too.",
      "This game is so cool,and i can play this every single day. I found out that Miga Town app thingy is copying graphics from Toca Boca, well i think they run out of ideas.Back in the topic me and my sister are playing this everyday i hope some of your apps is free,thank you very much for these games!",
      "This game is super fun, but after awhile it got kinda boring, so I switched to the world version, but I think this game would be perfect for younger kids who are very curious about the world around them and who love to move things around. 😊",
      "I love this app😍 it is my favorite one i have on my phone. However it is expensive, the price is worth it for such an awesome game. I dislike it when people say \"how dare you raise the prices! 1 star!\" When they dont even know how much time and coding these games take. Keep up the great work, and thank you for the awesome games😁",
      "So Addicting! I'm old. Not like four years old or five. Im old. This is a game meant for younger children. Im an old child and I just get so wrapped up in all of the creative things and stories you can make up in the game! The people are super cute and this game is definitely worth $0.99! I hope that everyone who is looking at buying this app goes through with it. Its so much fun! I play this game more than anything else on my phone!"

The game makes it easy and fun for your child to gain an intuitive understanding of numbers. It's a great introduction to the wonderful world of math.\r\n\r\nDragonBox Numbers brings math to life by turning numbers into colorful and relatable characters, called Nooms. The Nooms can be stacked, sliced, combined, sorted, compared and played with, any way your child pleases.\r\n\r\nThe app contains 4 different activites for your child to explore, each designed to challenge your child to use the Nooms and basic math in a different way.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sandbox\" section of the game is designed to let your child explore and experiment with the Nooms. It's also the perfect tool for parents and teachers to explain basic math concepts to kids.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Puzzle\" section, your child will use basic math to create their own puzzle pieces, and place them in the right spot to reveal a hidden picture. Every move your child makes reinforces number sense. Your child will perform thousands of operations while solving the 250 puzzles.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Ladder\" section, your child will have to think strategically to build larger numbers. Your child will develop an intuitive understanding of how larger numbers relate to small numbers, and practice basic math strategies every step of the way.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Run\" section, your child will have to direct the Noom down a path using quick mental calculations. Your child can use their fingers, Nooms or numerals to jump over obstacles. This activity reinforces your child's number sense and trains their ability to quickly recognise and add numbers.\r\n\r\nDragonBox Numbers is based on the same pedagogical principles as the other games in the award-winning DragonBox series, and works by integrating the learning seamlessly into the gameplay, no quizzes or mindless repetitions.

      "Just reinstalled and noticed the 'Run' game, which auto-rotates to landscape, now clips the right side of the playfield, which appears all black. perhaps after a little delay after rotating, you could force a resize to the full screen size? this tablet is android 4.4.2, galaxy tab 4 (model sm-t230nu) Please fix. That part of the app is my kid's favorite, and he was pretty grumpy when it wasn't playable. Thank you, will be picking up your new chess game soon!!",
      "Very good app. My kid learned a lot from it. He loves the \"yay\" sound at the end of each puzzle. Two little critiques: The blocks get very small and hard to drag on the big puzzles. Also, I find the \"buying puzzles with coins\" mechanic tedious."

      "A Worthwhile investment. Just downloaded it for my son who is 4 years old . I love the reward system very unique . And it gets progressively harder. But helps the child adjust and learn . And gives hints after child has difficulty. But not to soon let's the trail and error aspect help learning. My son loves the music. Educational and fun . I like how it has no pointless games. Unlike many other apps",

A good range of different activities that use different input mechanisms, and blend letter names and sounds, in a way that works really well for my 3y olds. Try THUP Monkey Math School Sunshine too, it's also better than any other we've found for math!",

      "This truly is one of my favorite apps at age 15. It's relaxing and fun. Though, I have suggestions. One: Maybe add a reset button? It's frustrating to restart the way I do. And: could you add zooming in on the build screen to make building the biome easier? Other than those things, this is a calming game and i love it 💕 definitely worth $4",
      "This game is fun, and Nice to play but it needs more things to do and more variety in animals and tools to make the biome It has so much potential if you made it more interesting and have more variety",
      "You need to feed the hungry lethargic animals (which is endless)! ..Not to mention the very limited design options. The first time you zoom in you see starving animals to the point of laying down who need YOU in order to eat & have the energy to stand and move around. To top it off it cost money, it's a kids app and it's from toca boca which up till now i thought was pretty cool.",
      "Not very entertaining. Not much to do, except make landscapes, play with the animals, feed animals (not many aswell.) and collect food, along with taking photos. No save, nothing else. Not worth the money and disappointed. Good things is that the models look cute and you can feed the animals, which makes them grow. Dissapoined and, like i said, disappointed. 98% Boredom 2% Cuteness.",
      "This app is AMAZING!!! First I had it on Samsung kids app, Then my tablet got really low on space, so I got a phone, And I searched for this game and I couldn't find it until last week. I swear this is the best app🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊"

    "description":"DragonBox Algebra 5+ - The game that secretly teaches algebra\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra 5+ Is perfect for giving young children a head start in mathematics and algebra. Children as young as five can easily begin to grasp the basic processes involved in solving linear equations without even realising that they are learning. The game is intuitive, engaging and fun, allowing anyone to learn the basics of algebra at his or her own pace.\r\n\r\nDragonBox Algebra 5+ covers the following algebraic concepts:\r\n\r\n* Addition\r\n* Division\r\n* Multiplication\r\n\r\nSuitable from age five and up, DragonBox Algebra 5+ gives young learners the opportunity to get familiar with the basics of equation solving.\r\n\r\nDragonBox uses a novel pedagogical method based on discovery and experimentation.

      "This is awesome. When my kid started playing it first, I thought I had been swindled as it had some pictures and clicking stuff made things disappear. But then a few games later things started changing and by the end, without her knowing she was working with Xs, As, Bs and Cs. Mind blown. Definitely recommend it. Going to buy the next level up",
      "This app was not only helpful to my first son it also build confidence and interest for my second son. It's his idea to download this app. I just wish I could use the app across iPhone and Android to save some money.",
      "It doesn't explain why equations work and if your stuck there is no hint box all i know is blobs cancel out blobs, was expecting more of a experience. Like if this blob and another blob was 5 over 3 then use this mathematical principal to complete. But no it says match these to complete, once you get to fractions on both sides there is no binding the knowledge so you fail. Im sure there are hundreds of games out there that have the same \"this is technically math\" problems that teach you nothing",
      "This ap is excellent! My 1st grader really learned the concepts of algebra and truly enjoyed it. Several family members can create profiles, so I've been playing too. I find it kind of relaxing, and challenging at times. I haven't practiced much algebra in years and was never much of a math person. The design is very clever and allows kids to catch on pretty easily, while adults can work on trying to complete problems in the correct number of moves without leaving behind extra cards.",
      "I'm a highschool math teacher that is using this app to teach my 6yr old patterning. He did the first level and part of the second level (addition, subtraction, zero pairs), on his own, but needs help with multiplication/division. For a 6yr old, this is awesome. I highly recommend this app."

      "Where as I would love to leave a 5 star review for this app I cannot. All 3 of my children have loved Bob Books for years so when I came across this app I thought how fantastic. I have a new reader in the family and how cool to have the Bob books they love on a mobile device. I did not hesitate to pay the 2.99. Now I regret making a rush decision. So basically the levels 1-4 were mirror images of each other. I anticipated that if I was paying 2.99 for this I would have received more.",

It will probably be a 3-4 star game if ypu are looking for something to cure your boredom",

      "I love this app!! There are free apps out there I've used, but they have strange gaps. FlowerChecker has real people with plant/botany experience (!), very much worth the nominal fee. It might take a day or so to get back to you, however, it's gratifying to learn the Latin name(s) along with common iterations. They get all the stars, thumbs up, and the pumpkin stickers to boot 😁😊",
      "nice app! it's not free like the other ones but you do get actual botanists replying to you. Which is much more helpful than trying to match up a picture of a plant's leaf or flower to existing photos online. or trying to guess what your plant is or identifying the wrong species. So this is more effective. It did take them about 12 hours to respond back to me but they did identify the plant correctly.",
      "Absolutely spot on with a not ordinary tropical plant. Thank you.",
      "I've used this service a few times and was especially concerned about a beautiful succulent that was in terrible shape. Its leaves were turning black, and I couldn't get help on line. I sent 2 pictures to FlowerChecker and got a quick response that identified the problem. Great value for a modest cost. They're my go to place for help with my extensive desert property.",
      "First time user. You have to pay for the app then they only give you 3 coins. You have to use one to ask the botanist and then you have to use another coin to see their response. Basically, it's a one-time use app unless you want to pay them more money. I got a response that said it's \"probably Tilia platyphyllos\". When I looked up this tree it varies in shapes and sizes. I'm not quite sure it's correct. I'm disappointed in this app and will try a different one next time."

The only bad thing I can say about it is you can't play with them in any way that's why I did not give it 5 🌟s but anyways great game.",

      "I like it, but i wish that you made a game (specifically free) for these little creatures you can save and import to the game and also make QR Codes too, if nintendo did it, you can too toca boca. p.s i know this is aimed at a much younger audience than me, but kids love videogames so much that they need a new fresh free adventure. That is where you come in, you can give children a chance to play the game, and if they do not have toca mini then they can create only one for free, i at least think it's a good idea What would you make? The kids like side scrolling runners!",

      "Dave, you took a good thing and turned it into something annoying. Do yourself a favor and get rid of the strong arm tactics and put in a button so that those who want the extra features, can pay for the extra features, like every other app on the market. Personally, I'm tired of seeing you beg for more money every time I open your app, an app I already paid for. Now, you may care less if I unsubscribe, but when thousands refuse to pay the monthly fee, what have you gained? Already tried that,",
      "Can Not Use! Dave, I love you to pieces, but I could never use the actual clock itself. The app would always freeze. Then I got a prompt to update the other day.... And now I cannot open the app whatsoever. It always sends me an error report. Help! Happy to update to five stars if this ever works out right.",
      "Was a nice app before the hammer came down and it's now required for us to check a box that no one will know what we gave away by permissions in addition to making it real difficult to deny subscription. Real bait and switch method and my life was good before this app and will be good sticking this app on the other side of the flat earth.",
      "I've just bought the app and it's got my location and the correct time and date but the sun is nowhere near where it should be. It's 7.16pm here in New Zealand and the sun is just west of South America. Also can the app be set to be your PC desktop whenever you turn on your laptop? I try to get the app on the 24 hour mode but it keeps reverting to 12 hours. Any advice would help. Thank you because I appreciate what you are trying to do.",
      "After Facebook disabled my account for sharing Flat Earth ideology posts, it was because of this app and the daily videos, I was able to find true Flat Earth channels on YouTube do to their algorithms in their search engine making it virtually impossible to find a channel that doesn't debunk or at least try's to debunk the whole ideology in itself. I was able to subscribe to the channel and from there, find other channels that they subscribed to theirselves. This app was well worth the money! 🤫"

Learning the phonograms is essential for accurate and automatic reading, writing, and spelling. Teaching all the sounds of the phonemes represented by an alphabet letter or combination of two, three, or four letters (phonograms) enables students to read, spell, and write high-frequency words quickly. Students who learn the phonograms well expand their vocabulary and are able to use effective and creative communication skills in writing. Critical thinking is involved in learning the appropriate phonogram placement within words for accurate spelling and for applying information learned during phonogram reviews to pronounce unfamiliar words. \r\n\r\nThe Spalding Phonograms app is for students that need additional practice, including home schooling, ESL (English as a Second Language), ELL (English Language Learners), ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) students, and those with dyslexia or other learning disabilities. The school and home connection is encouraged through collaboration and communication with the teacher, parent, and student for practicing the phonograms appropriately and adequately. The Spalding  Phonograms app aligns with the core reading foundational skills required by state and national standards that are most crucial to the development of early reading success and reading comprehension, including:\r\n\r\n  •\tPhonemic awareness\r\n  •\tFeature recognition\r\n  •\tLetter recognition\r\n  •\tSound-symbol relationships (decoding)\r\n\r\nThe Spalding Phonograms app provides the following options for all 87 phonograms.\r\n\r\n  •\tPhonogram Introduction by selected group – The student sees the phonograms in order of instruction in \"The Writing Road to Reading,\" listens to the teacher say the sound(s), and then says the sound(s).\r\n  •\tOral Phonogram Review – A random phonogram card is show, followed by a pause.

The card is immediately shown so the student can check for accuracy.\r\n  •\tDifferentiated Practice – Specific phonograms (from all 87) can be selected that need more practice.

      "Very disappointed that this app stops doing the audio portion aloud after about 15 phonograms. There must be some kind of bug on the android version. I have to back all the way out and restart the app in order for it to play the sounds again. It has been the same problem ever since we started using it 3 weeks ago. Very frustrating. Please fix bug. When it does work, it is good and it is nice to be able to hear the sounds. I regret I paid for this.",

      "I was hoping to use this app for a class and as a practice tool. But after downloading it, it has not worked. There is no sound. The whole point of this app is to help with phonogram sounds. I would not recommend this app.",

      "This app freezes or gets six to eight letters in then the sound stops working. Waste of money."

      "Everything is pretty well done. The only problem(that is pretty major in my opinion) is the reactions tab. When you enter a chemical it tells you in Russian how many hits it got. The app crashes when you put parenthesis( which is not expected because many many many formulas use regular parenthesis : Al(OH)3 for instance) and really just the fact that yes, there are a ton of reactions, but there's also some that shouldn't get missed like Schweitzer's reagent or Caro's acid or Na[Al(OH)4] complex",
      "Great app. One suggestion would be to make the \"electrons protons neutrons\" section tappable which opens the isotope list. It would be good if the isotope list showed percentages as well.",
      "Hi. I am rating this low because I purchased it but it still keeps crashing for listing all the elementes for some characteristics like Electronegativite and density. Please fix it and i will rate again. Thanks!",
      "Pretty comprehensive app. Handy to have when you've got chemistry homework. Would be nice to see more tables added such as acid/base equilibrium constants Ka and Kb values, and maybe shapes of the orbitals and types of bonding (pi vs sigma bonds).",
      "Good, but... It would be nice if you could add wave length in the emmision spectrums, and also a Electro configuration table for komplex structures would be nice (like hexacyanoferrat(III))"

Some of use need any advantage we can get.",

That be being said - none of the question were phrased exactly the same within the mock exam to the real test, in most cases it was completely different. However, understanding my mistakes alongside what I already knew it made my exam a lot smoother and stopped any panic. Which resulted in a pass.",
      "This app is 100% legitimate! It helps you to understand and reinforce the concepts. I highly recommend. It assisted me in passing (as well as taking a class). Do not rely soley on the app, it is meant to help you reinforce what you learn. My ONLY complaint is the progress button. When taking mock exams, if you accidentally press the button, you cannot go back to your place in the exam. Please put in a pop up that asks if you really want to exit the exam, or allow re-entry (a back button option).",
      "Been using for a couple of days now and whilst it is ok, I have run into problems when reviewing tests I've taken. If I've answered incorrectly I will be told so, but then the right answer will not be given to me, meaning I'm not learning from any mistakes I make. Also, even though sometimes I have answered a question correctly, and it shows as correct, when I go to review it and click 'explain' it shows information for a different answer than the one I gave. Overall, an OK app.",
      "Overall the app is ok. However, I have found that what I select on the mock exams is changed when I finish it. For example I select answer A, however when reviewing my answers it is listed as incorrect and that I chose answer B, which I didn't.",

      "Overall i think this app is great and is very well optimized, but i would really like if you could add a feature that would let us import textures from other texturpacks that we have in our internal storage. It would really help us make a texture pack that us people really enjoy. I know there is a way to import textures but what i am saying is i want to import large amounts of textures to the texture pack i am making at once like for example i want to have the dark mode gui in my texture pack",
      "It does what it says, it just looks horrible while doing it. The ui looks like it came straight from the early 2000s. The ui is so bad that you cant zoom in far enough to edit the fire, and the eraser tool doesnt go big enough to erase anything like the lumpkin blur. This app needs a overhaul, please.",
      "It's good, I just have problems with making new texture packs. When I open my new pack, I'm unable to click on a section, when I try to search, nothing shows up. I'll give a 5 star rating if you fix this bug.",
      "This is a great texture pack maker for minecraft and its not a rip off like the other texture apps put there but theres a problem i can't use the skins i made with skinseed for zombie mobs and theres no shading option but other than that its worth the buck. Can you also make the mob making easier i get confused where the nose legs and other stuff is"

      "Great app! You pay one time and you get the complete game(entire alphabet), no in-app purchases, no ads. Fun and educational. NOTE TO AVOKIDDO If you made one for numbers and math I would buy it! Please consider ;)",
      "Good game. Would be nice to have a choice of narrator to go with us/uk spellings (I've never heard and way \"apricot\" like that before!) but understand that is much more costly to develop. The biggest issue is that kids can drag the letters in any order when spelling, I would prefer an option to force writing the word left-to-right (you know like we do everywhere else).",
      "I have a hard time finding good games for my 3 year old. This one was totally worth the money. Its enertaining and he learns letters and other skills by playing it. Its even fun to watch him play. Really digging avakiddo games",
      "My 4 year old loves it! Lots of learning in a fun way!",
      "This is by far the best game I have found for my 3-1/2 year old son. He really likes to play it and it is helping him learn his letters.  I realize you can jump to any letter manually, but I think it would be good to have an option to either start the game on a random letter instead of \"A\" every time and/or move through the letters in random order.  Overall, excellent, high quality game and well worth the price."

    "title":"BirdGenie: ID Birds by Song",
    "description":"BirdGenie™ is a breakthrough app that helps anyone with a smartphone or tablet accurately identify birds in the backyard, local park, or on the nature trail—all with the tap of a button! Just hold up your phone, record the bird singing, and BirdGenie™ helps you identify the species. The app’s highly developed sound identification ability and expert matching system enable bird enthusiasts to achieve an accuracy unheard of in the birding field. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to learn more about the birds around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBirdGenie™ includes up to two hundred vocalization types for one hundred species: literally all of the birds likely to be encountered in a backyard or local park, or on a hike, in North America at any time of the year. And the app is easy to use. Just point your smartphone or tablet at a bird, and tap the screen when the bird starts singing.

      "Very cool idea, but no way to help the app learn if it asks the same questions over and over, and presents the same potential matches. I know for a fact I was listening to an Eastern Whipbird, but try telling the app it wasn't a dang Crackle. Come up with some new birds, Princeton!",
      "Did an okay job - Developer bug clutters photo folder big time by not self containing all image files and sound files to a dedicated folder. Instead it created a hundred folders within my root image and sound folders... Incredibly annoying!",
      "I am uninstalling this ap. No matter how close, crystal clear and beautiful a recording I obtained, I NEVER got a match. On top of that, the images from the app populated my gallery in an intrusive way that seemed impossible to remedy! Enough. Cumbersome and useless. So sad, I had dreamed of an app like this for years, just one that worked. and argh!! after removing the app, the distorted images are still there and I need to search them out and delete manually.",
      "I didnt even have a chance to try it out. I had to uninstall because if the ridiculous way it overtook my phones photo gallery. I couldnt find anything in there anymore except what it dumped in there. It was absolutely ridiculous. Just what a person wants when they ooen their photo gallery is to habe to wade through a hundred photos of vouce recordings of birds. Terrible design flaw, i expected better with it coming out of a university.",
      "I can't believe that I PAID for this app. Every time I tried to use it, the app shut down after recording the birds. Plus, my gallery filled up with sound recordings and bird pictures. Very upsetting."

      "I used to love this app. Since late upgrade it's unstable, and much more difficult to get to what I want. I used to be able to select the object I wish to view and easily know where and when I could see it. Now I can't seem to figure out what I used to be able to do so easily. Maybe I'm just getting dumber. Time to uninstall and look for something else.",
      "Not sure what else is out there, been a fan of SkEye for some time but after trying MO free I've moved to the paid version It has added more enjoyment to a passing interest in astronomy with greater access to a variety of information and features. eg Downloadable catalogues. Unfortunately no way to turn off the live motion during Skyview (not Live view). Very annoying to keep chasing an object as it moves off the screen!!",
      "This app is amazing! So many helpful features. I've used it for a few years now over 3 different phones and never once encountered a bug. I work in Outdoor Education and it is SO useful for campouts and stargazing programs. Worth the money for sure!",
      "I've been a huge fan of this app since its first version The new one is just as informative and easy to use, with a great update to the interface and features. The developer has always been responsive as well. By far the best value of any paid astronomy app. Edit: U/I updates done right. Just keeps getting better. 3.3.0 is beautiful and includes great new functionality. Keep it up!",
      "Tons of features that I have the confidence are always up to date with the most accurate view for my location. Graphics and performance are outstanding. A must have app for anyone that can see the night sky at their house!"

    "title":"Sky Guide",
    "description":"Sky Guide is an astronomy app for sophisticated star enthusiasts and hobby astronomers who value well-founded and precise astronomical illustrations and data.\r\n\r\nThe basic app function displays a detailed, scalable and fully user-configurable celestial map with constellations and celestial objects (limit magnitude up to 6.3) that are visible with the naked eye or smaller telescopes. The place and time of observation as well as the direction of view can be manually configured by the user or automatically with the so-called “Live mode” (i.e. GPS, real-time and compass-guided).\r\n\r\nDetailed additional information is available for every celestial object (fixed star, deep sky object, planet, moon, sun, meteorite shower).

      "Fantastic App! I purchased the book and decided to get the app so I can stay in test mode. It works great, and gives options for test mode or study mode. I am sure to pass with it.",
      "There are only two modes. Test and study.  Study has an \"explanation\" button to explain the question. Its not a traditional type of study where you read something first THEN take the test.   But the chart section seems to be functionally useless. It asks you what the class airspace is around a given airport, and refers you to the chart. The thing is, you need to the key to figure out what type of airspace the squiggly lines represent, and they don't show the key!    When you hit the explanation it says its \"Class D\" or \"Class C\" and cites the key.  But again, the key is not actually provided, so it really does no good. Maybe I am missing something but I don't see the key readily available.",
      "Simple interface that gives you exactly what you need. Only app I've found that let's you select which Bank of questions, which is great because you can do a practice test right after finishing a chapter. However, these are the same exact questions as on the ASA Test Prep guide, and I was looking for a different set of questions to round out my knowledge. Supposedly includes most recent FAA updates but the app was last updated in Nov 2018 and most recent FAA update was Feb 2019."

      "I do LOVE this app. You can get the info faster on earthquakes than even the usgs site. My only problem is the color of the earthquakes on the map. All of the earthquakes that happened in the past 24 hours are red. It would be nice if you showed a different between the earthquakes in the past hour and the rest of the earthquakes. I live in Ridgecrest Ca. I do feel this is the best app for earthquakes and volcanoes. I will change my rating if you make that small change.",
      "Very well developed app ^ ^ very timely, accurate and not bad on your battery. The features I wish I had: night time mode for EQ list, highlighted variance for EQ magnitude manual adjustments by the geological surveys made after reported. The surveys ESMC and USGS do a lot of downgrading for some reason. Maybe they used sensors from a 5th grade science project. Regardless VD does great work",
      "As maximum depth of earthquake is there, i would also like to see minimum depth added, then 5* rating comes. Silly to have one direction but not the other on filters. edit- thank you for reviewing my comment and communicating with me as well as implementing my request. by far the best quake source mapper on android!",
      "it was a great app I even paid for the upgrade but for some reason it no longer notifies me when there is an earthquake or a volcanic eruption. I have gone through the settings a dozen times if it does not start working I want a refund!!!",
      "Worth it. Used it since 2018. By far the best Earthquake & Volcano notification app."

      "I love this app! We homeschool and I have always had a hard time teaching my kids algebra. While this game doesn't cover everything, the core concepts became very clear and easy to apply after using it. I wish there were more games like this!",
      "I've played the game for about an hour or so. My rating isn't a reflection of the quality of the app, but more so a reflection of it not suiting my learning style. I don't really like the little pictures, I much prefer just numbers and algebraic letters, it confused me to a point where equations I could solve outside of this app, I got confused on. Lastly, it's an issue for my learning style...I'm more of a need to know learner. this game explains your specials but not actual rules to algebra.",
      "Each play in the game uses pictures to represent numbers. It doesnt make sense unless you already know what the moves represent. Like a frog on top of a frog, and you slide them together to create something that looks like an egg. That represents creating a whole number from a fraction, creating 1 from 2/2. But you wouldn't know that just from playing the game. Maybe in conjunction with school lessons, it might have some value.",
      "love it. played it through during the summer because my teacher did a bad job of explaining algebra. This is wonderful and introduces it as a game and slowly switches to letters and numbers.",
      "I'm tired of low quality free games with tons of ads. I'd rather pay for quality content. This was easily worth 8 dollars."

      "This game is so fun I play it all day but the only thing wrong was it needs more stuff to do. It needs more game modes ,more people,and more stuff. Besides that it is really good.Good job Toka!",
      "A cute app that my kids would enjoy for a few minutes and then ignore. There is only one track, and there is no winning. You have the option of building your own version of the same track but that still seems very limited for a paid app. Dont think its a great fit for younger kids under 6.",

      "The app is full of features & makes learning easy. However, the Incorrect dialog that appears on a wrong answer is downright annoying. Sometimes it's dismissable by tapping on it, sometimes it's not. I can't discern the logic, and the way that the dialog behaves makes it frustrating to practice. Were it not for this, I'd give the app 5 stars.",
      "Seriously, awesome! I was having a hard time learning and this app, out of all of them was the best one to learn from for me. I went from zero knowledge to at least being able to somewhat understand CW with 2-4 hours of total time using this app. Decided to purchase the full version in support of the developer for making a great, intuitive app and no ads of course. Highly recommend if you're trying to learn!",
      "VG all round. Extreme frustration with scale of dot time back to front. This was not immediately obvious. I originally gave this a one star before having another crack at the dot length time. If the scale was reversed the app would be a near perfect 5.",
      "I was so impressed I bought it! Then it worked differently! Why did you change it from a simple touch screen to having the dots on one side and the dashes on the other! I thought the original idea fitted better for someone learning to use a single keying device, as they would if they were actually sending Morse over the airwaves. .AIRWAVES. .-. .--. My initials! Thank you it wasn't as obvious as I was expecting. I thought the settings symbol would have given me the option, but now I am happy!",
      "Tried free version and was learning morse during lul life moments so decided to get serious. Spend most time on 'Recognize Sound letters' new 'Recognize Sound letters' option goes to fast for me. I like 'Words' as can practice at my pace and is a confidence booster that I know the letters, I am just slow."

Graphics are good but the two kiddos I downloaded this for couldn't play together. One watched the other one play the whole game (in 10 min) and was disappointed to find out when it was her turn that it was the exact same challenges. Just needs some improvement or needs to be free. Might be fun for younger kids."

      "Really advanced cross platform flashcards app. Totally worth it!",
      "I have used your application to study Japanese for several years now. I'm probably on it for about an hour every day. It's great. The flexibility and options to customize is fantastic. It's perfect for how I like to study. I use it to study vocabulary, grammar, and conversational Japanese. I like to go over the words, grammer, phrases that are due in a list form. A large part of what I'm using the app for is to maintain my knowledge. Reviewing then testing is great for that.",
      "Excellent that you can make Excel spreadsheets and upload those instead of having to input one word at a time. Clear instructions provided on website. I really like this app and all the options. I searched a long time to find one with the spelling practice capabilities that you can turn on and off and use to type in characters of different languages. Great support as well.",
      "This app is feature rich. But more important, I discovered there is a real person who actually took the time to answer my email about a feature. I wrote and the next thing I know I had a response. There are good tutorials, a helpful website and a good user forum of ideas, tips and tricks. There is a community where you can share Knowledge Decks with other learners on many many subjects. I am 66. I decided I wanted to learn how to learn again. I am glad I chose Flashcards Deluxe. So will you."

    "title":"The Zones of Regulation",
    "description":"The Zones of Regulation (www.zonesofregulation.com) is a framework for thinking as well as a curriculum geared toward helping students gain skills in consciously regulating their behaviors, including the management of their emotions and level of alertness. This, in turn, leads to increased self-control and problem solving abilities. \r\n\r\nLeah Kuypers is the author of the book, The Zones of Regulation (2011, Social Thinking Publishing). The Zones of Regulation was featured as a promising practice in Attention Magazine and is being implemented school wide in districts across the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Zones assists students in conceptualizing how they are feeling by creating a system to categorize their emotions and levels of alertness into one of four zones. Using a cognitive behavior approach, the App's learning activities are designed to help students recognize when they are in different zones, with each of the four zones represented by a different color. \r\n\r\nThe Zones is designed to be used with elementary students, secondary students, and adults. \r\n\r\nThroughout the App, students learn how to use strategies or tools to manage their feelings and behaviors in each zone. Given each student's needs and preferences are unique, students explore various calming techniques, cognitive strategies, and sensory supports, building a toolbox of methods to use to regulate and move between zones. \r\n\r\nHowever, self-regulation takes a lot more than knowing about tools. To deepen students' understanding of how to self-regulate, the App also explores how triggers or different events can impact how they are feeling. \r\n\r\nThe App highlights how to read others' facial expressions and recognize a broader range of emotions and perspectives about how others see and react to their behavior, insight into events that trigger their different zones, and when and how to use tools and problem solving skills to change the way they are thinking and feeling.\r\n\r\nThe App provides a fun, and engaging experience while learning and gaining valuable knowledge to assist in developing real-life skills. Students will be taken on an adventure throughout a town filled with excitement, rewards, and mini games. \r\n\r\nTo enhance learning, it is recommended that an adult closely monitor the student's progression through the App, asking probing questions and facilitating discussions about how the App's content can be generalized to the student's real life. The content of the App can be further explored using the lessons and learning activities featured in the curriculum book, The Zones of Regulation.\r\n\r\nDownload The Zones of Regulation today!",

I think the tests are questions are a little out of date and could use a refresh, but when I took the test it only took me 30 minutes and I passed with an 84%. I feel this app really helped me in pass.",
      "Very easy to use and helpful to study material already covered with the site/book. They should add more questions and shuffle them (they repeat every time). This should also be included if you buy the course. Overall, helpful but does not replace studying the book!"

      "Fantastic questions but buggy. Multiple times it marks questions wrong where I picked the right answer. I won't do tests above 10 questions on this app because I want to make sure I memorize my answers when it grades me so I can check. Also I would love some statistics to see where I need to focus studying. I find the pocket prep app better with more features but this one has better questions... If you put these questions into the pocket prep app it would be the perfect study guide",
      "The app is basically a lazy design with all the questions copy and pasted from the book, everything single question. While it's convenient to have all the questions handy, the price point can't be justified, especially if the app can't remember that you already started a test when you restart the app.",
      "I will admit that the practice test questions were nothing like the actual questions on the Pearson Vue test but they were and teaching me how to learn a thought process. plus when you got the answer wrong it explained to you why it was wrong and showed you the right answer and explained why it was the right answer. Also, it may be more importantly, the acronyms dictionary is what really helped me the most in passing my CompTIA Security+ exam. Acronyms help with the questions on the test.",
      "This is a great app and compliments Darril Gibson book on Security+. I used this and the book and was able to pass the test.",

      "This is my favourite of the three Genki apps. The original is usefiul earlier on, but this is a great app when you have the basic grammar and vocabulary down.   This app only takes hiragana answers (required installing a japanese keyboard on my phone), which is unlike previous Genki apps (where you could use romaji). Once I got over this hiccup the app is, in my opinion, better than writing using a regular keyboard. It helps you to write sentences in actual Japanese and gets you accustomed to how a Japanese person would write messages on his/her phone.  Although the app is primarily advertised as a way to learn conjugation, I prefer the app for learning the example sentences on the back of each flash card. The in app testing only checks to see if you know how to conjugate a word. Sometimes I find the conjugation easy but translating the example sentence hard, so I find myself lying to the app, pretending I don't know the conjugation so that I can review the sentence later. I wish there was a way to \"star\" specific cards for being difficult (either for difficulty in conjugation or for translating the sentence).",
      "Good app overall. The listing is IMO not very practical. Listing the adj and verbs by lesson would be more useful. same for the sets. Some items in L4 are in set 2, some from L6 are in set 1, etc. Does not make sense. Group them by order of the lessons! I'm working with the books. It is difficult to revise what I need if most things are mixed up! Please sory it out.",
      "This is by far the best of the three Genki applications, being able to type in the answers is very helpful. I think the application could do with a bit more polish and features to be deserving of more than 3 stars. Overall I find this application useful for learning Japanese verb and adjective conjunction.",
      "Thank you for finally releasing this apps. I love Genki Elementary Japanese book very much. With this apps it is really easy to study and I will use it whenever I am waiting in the car. The sequence is very well organized in line with the textbook.",
      "It's a good review and practice tool of basics forms, there are some issues and suggestions for the app 1 keyboard covers the correct/incorrect line and pressing enter doesnt drop the keyboard or go to next slide 2 on the deck sometimes only the English appears 3 writing in romaji doest work 4 there should be more decks to review with"

    "title":"The Zones of Regulation : Exploring Emotions",
    "description":"The Zones of Regulation®: Exploring Emotions is an application designed to foster self-regulation skills in fun and exciting ways while simulating everyday situations students can relate to.\r\n\r\nExploring Emotions is based off of the widely adopted framework, The Zones of Regulation, by Leah Kuypers (www.zonesofregulation.com). The framework was published as a curriculum (2011, Social Thinking Publishing, www.socialthinking.com) as well as an original app, both titled The Zones of Regulation. The Zones of Regulation teaches four concrete colored “zones” to categorize all the feelings, sensory states and emotions we experience, helping students develop awareness of how they are feeling and by providing a simple language and visual structure to communicate their feelings to others. In addition, students learn about tools and how they can be used to manage each of their zones. The app helps students gain skills in consciously regulating their behaviors to the social and environmental demands.\r\n\r\nExploring Emotions offers a new medium to address self-regulation needs and reinforce The Zones framework. There are several features in the app that create a comprehensive learning experience:\r\n\r\n• Audio voiceover enriches the experience for students by providing social interaction between characters and instructional teachings throughout the app.\r\n\r\n• Data tracking allows students to apply what they are learning in the app to their own life by self-monitoring and reflecting on their feelings (Zones) and how they were managed during events that occurred over the course of their day. These graphs can be saved, revisited and edited, and also emailed to an email address.\r\n\r\n• Easy navigation throughout the app allows students to return to any point in the app to replay and consider different outcomes.\r\n\r\n• Integration of an expansive toolbox that is fully customizable by students. Students learn about and categorize dozens of tools to help them manage their zones. They are also able to adjust the content of their toolbox.\r\n\r\n• Incorporation of mini games provide real-time the opportunity for students to reflect on the outcome of games and how this triggers emotions.\r\n\r\n• Multiple environments including a classroom, a cafeteria, and a park that offer different scenarios, events and activities to participate in. Students easily relate to the various situations presented throughout the app, helping them to make connections between learning in the app to real life.\r\n\r\n• Reinforcing activities are infused throughout the app. For example, students can unlock a mini game and customize their avatar by coloring their hair and buying custom outfits.\r\n\r\n• References to The Zones of Regulation curriculum are embedded throughout the app to assist adults who support a student in locating additional educational resources to strengthen learning.\r\n\r\nExploring Emotions is designed to be used with Pre-K, elementary students, secondary students, as well as is applicable to adults that struggle with emotional control. To enhance learning, it is recommended that an adult closely monitor the student's progression through the App, asking probing questions and facilitating discussions about how the App's content can be generalized to the student's real life. Exploring Emotions is a resource for parents to teach and encourage self-control and emotional management in the home through the Zones framework. It is an exciting resource for therapists and teachers looking to address social emotional learning (SEL) through a medium that is motivating for students to engage in.\r\n\r\nThe App provides a fun and engaging experience for students while learning and gaining valuable knowledge to assist in developing real-life skills in self-regulation and emotional control.\r\n\r\nDownload The Zones of Regulation: Exploring Emotions today!",

      "Useless compared to the iOS version; I bought this after using it in a cello lesson - having it call out notes and then play them was a really handy exercise, particularly with random keys and accidentals. The Android version seems to have around 10% of the features.",
      "I loved this app and was so happy with it until I just had a look at the apple version. WHAT IN THE WORLD?! Why is there such a difference? I feel cheated! Please get those functions available for Android! Especially the microphone function, where you can play notes on an actual piano. Please please please!",
      "Please provide equal functionality in the android version. It is not correct to provide more features on a ios version. Are there any developer roadblocks you are facing while coding the android version?",
      "The app is fine, but there are so many more features that they haven't gotten for android users. My 7 yo daughter saw that there was a unicorn version that we can't get on our android. She's been bitter ever since. Please undate for android users too!!! Please!!",
      "I was asked to purchase this ap by my daughter's piano teacher. Not enough of the keyboard shows to correctly answer the notes. We can not connect to her teacher because we do not use Apple products and she does. There are other options on Apple products. We do not use apple products. When the ap is updated to work the same on Android as Apple I will change my review."

This tool takes all the guesswork out of the image, outlining the image with ease, and so fast. I had been printing images and copying with a pentagraph, or drawing free hand with mixed results. I had an issue with the app crashing when i purchased, Samuel fixed over night. well done, thanks.",
      "I have tried a few apps of this kind and find this drawing app is the best one for what I want to do. I had an issue with the camera and Sam from support was amazing and fast, can't thank him enough. If you can't draw, this app will help you enormously, just keep practicing and it will get easier and faster, that's what I did. Awesome App 🙂",
      "This app is the answer to all my drawing frustrations. Where have you been ask my life? At first I was a little hesitant because I found it advertised on instagram along side all the shady ad ridden games. This is not like them. Well worth the price, believe me. Would give it 6 stars if I could.",
      "This is the best app which could be used for tracing any type of image but black and white. it would be fun if it could also identify colours.",
