      "After the latest update, pressing on a classroom causes an error 'something went wrong, try again later' then I'm automatically unrolled from my class! I'm furious about this issue and it seems that many other people are getting it. It needs attention. Other than that, before the update Google classroom is great and I used it all the time to recieve assignments and post asignments",
      "Hey err... When I try log into my school account, it says \"We are sorry, but you do not have access to Classroom\" and \"Please contact your domain administrator for access\" and then it kicks me out of my school account! Weirdly though, it works through my Gmail account... I don't understand why it's saying that so please fix it! I need to work on things for school! üò≠ (P. S: I'm using an Android phone)",
      "I use this app as a student. IMHO, complexity of the app is low - the task for junior developer. But even here some things aren't good. At first, menu item \"calendar\" just opens system default calendar. Silly. Secondly, there is no possibility to configure notifications. Earlier push notifications appeared the day before due date, but last week they started to show at midnight of the due date and woke me up. Big Brother decided this is convenient for all. Keep up good work. One star so far.",
      "As some people have pointed out, with one of the latest updates I can no longer access any classes or log in. The app seems to be in a Beta update... I never signed up for it... Google also hasn't fixed it yet which makes me think it isn't a serious issue for Google. Just revert the update, please!",
      "Before the February 20 2020 update it was working just fine but after installing the lastest update, it keeps removing me from my classes. I think this is an app problem because on the website version of google classroom my classes are still there. I uninstalled the app and downloaded it but now it is saying that my gmail doesn't work. I just to let you guys know that can you please update the bug, thanks."

      "It's all right, but everytime I go to use it I have to log in. Which is annoying cause since we're on lockdown/isolation we're using it even more for the kids school work. And also when you login as a student, there is access to the other student's profiles- which is annoying because my kids keep clicking on their classmates accounts.",
      "App was working fine and then it kept telling me \"Oops something went wrong\". After reading multiple reviews, I uninstalled, power cycled my devices and reinstalled the app. For what? Nothing but the same \"oops\". This isn't an Oops, especially AFTER an update meant to address these issues! I have NO way to communicate with my child's teacher especially now that he's out for 2 weeks!",
      "I have used this app for a few school years & enjoyed it but about 2 months ago it gave me an error message & stopped sending/recieving texts. I've uninstalled/reinstalled it but now I get an error message to try again to log in later. I've tried it on a different device. I've tried to request a password reset but that failed also. Is there anything else I can try?",
      "Horrible! Why fix what wasn't broken? I have used Dojo for years. I have told everyone about it. Now that you have updated it, nothing works right. Yes, I uninstalled and reinstalled. I have signed out and in. Nothing is right. If I wanted my app to spin a blue circle for hours then this would get 5 stars. I need it to work regularly as my students depend on it and this new version is erratic at best.",
      "This app is an amazing tool to keeping in contact with your kids teachers. I was having a problem with my app, deleted it, reinstalled it, and even updated it (waited for an update) and still had problems. So I emailed Class Dojo and they helped me to get it working properly again! Thanks to Rachael with customer support!!!"

      "We LOVE EPIC! It helps us easily find books appropriate for my son's age as well as find books by themes that he is interested in. I love how some books are read to him while highlighting the words and how some are read for him to just listen to. It gives him fun access to books while we can't get out to the library during this virus for a VERY low price! He actually WANTS to read like 3 TIMES A DAY now! We have lots of books but I love letting him access books (appropriately) all on his own.",
      "Worked well on my phone initially, but on my tablet the start free trial option comes up no matter how many times I sign in, and also on my phone now. When I click this it tells me that its already activated and sends me back to sign in again. So, I can't access anything on my tablet or my phone, which was working earlier.",
      "Love the app but wish students could use at home. Also wish it was free for remote online learning and parents who choose to homeschool. Thank you! My students loved this site last year. Also wish it would extend to older grades as site is very easy to navigate. Sincerely Priscilla. Ps I just signed up for 1 month free and extra 30 day access for $7.99 . Ithought great time for grandkids to explore while most of us are at home during these trying times. Be safe my friends!",
      "I couldn't access to my account almost for a year. When i try to enter my account, there is some one month free page appears all the time. Now, i am really sick of it. This app charges $$ every month from my bank account. I sent email to support team, but i still haven't heard nothing from them. Also, i tried to unsubscribe on playstore, but it wasn't work . So, i don't want to spend my money on this useless app. Please, fix this problem.",
      "Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too."

      "This app could be a lot better. If you are in multiple different groups/classes, it doesn't allow you to push text notifications on which ones you want. You either get notifications via text for every single group you're in or none at all. Super annoying as I don't want nor need texts to be pushed through for every group I'm in! When you email tech about this or anything else, they're super unhelpful and won't actually address anything you asked about . Truly wish I didn't have to use this app!",
      "I use Remind for spur-of-the-moment communications with my university students. It works perfect in these kind of situations. My only complaint is that part of Remind could be geared toward college and university students. For example, the icons are clearly geared towards primary and secondary education. Unless I haven't figured out how, which could be the case, I would love it if things like the icons could be personalized or have more options that could be for college-level students.",
      "My experience with this version and the apple version were completely different. When i am typing the last few messages is hiding behind the keyboard. Not only that the app doesn't really send me reliable message notifications, yku can expand but if it's longer than the first line it won't show, it also doesn't show if they're read. Messages don't appear when the notification does. It's a very frustrating experience and I would like it if it were fixed.",
      "Its an incredibly helpful app, however it is incredibly frustrating how slow it is to send messages to teachers. Even with my own personal data, with good connection, it takes really long. I hope they fix this, or the whole purpose of communicating with teachers fast is not happening.",
      "Very great for school, but one key problem: If I were a teacher, I would want to delete old groups or messages that aren't wanted. Unfortunately, there is no way to delete messages or groups. It is great, near perfect for school communication, but I just wish there could be a way to remove conversations. Other than that, its a really great app!"

      "The lessons are good but the servers of this app are non-existent. The video keeps on buffering after every 4 or 5 seconds even though others apps work smoothly with the same network connection. The same is true for the Udemy website. It becomes frustrating after a certain time and the excitement to learn vanishes. I kept waiting for an hour to watch a 16 minute lesson and wasn't able to complete it. It was either a problem with the lesson or the Udemy server. It keeps on buffering.",
      "Works great but facing problems while playing videos and opening pdf lessons of my course at times. The videos get stuck displaying a message telling me to play the videos from my computer instead. It isn't a connectivity issue. The pdfs simply refuse to open while the ones on my phone open as usual. Moreover, this app works well only on high speed connection. When connected to the WiFi the video playback speed drastically reduces. I hope the problems get resolved soon. Thank you Udemy",
      "Hello Udemy team, I have an issue regarding the screen resolution. I cannot watch the videos in full screen body ratio. The width of the videos are fixed to certain level. And we cannot even zoom. As you can see when I play a video in YouTube. I can get Full screen display ratio. It would be better user experience. If you update it to the full screen size ratio. and also great helpful for mobile user's. Please look into it and let me know. Thank you. Kind regards.",
      "Please can someone explain why my course downloading is not effective. Each time I try to download a new course, the downloading starts from a previous course that I've already completed before. Is there any way I can correct this? However I've been enjoying the use of this App, this download issue is my only challenge. Please assist.",
      "I like the app but there are a few glitches I am facing recently. They are, 1) Even after downloading the whole course I am unable to view it when my internet is turned off or my phone is in poor network zone. 2) Recently I have bought a new course but I am unable to make the course offline, the download button does not work. Hoping to hear on a resolution soon for you. Thanks & Regards, Kevin Rodrigues"

      "If I could would rate between 4 and 3. The app works rather well a majority of the time but there are 2 specific drawbacks that each takes away about 1 star. First, The ability to customize, organizing in a way that makes it easier for the user to access what is most relevant, is present but not prevalent and certainly has potential to expand. Second, A majority of Extinctions and tools do not work. I've used this app for 4 years, and it has improved greatly and would like it to keep growing :)",
      "This app is great!! I have used this app for almost 2 years and it has always been my savior in turning things in and remembering to do homework. Most, if not all, of the professors use this app, and so do the others at the school I'm transferring to this fall. Canvas is super easy to use on both android phones and computers.",
      "The App is bonkers af, bruh. The lectures when you try to open them? Doesn't load, and downloading them is such a chore, so slow even if you have stable connection to the internet. Notifications is meh, and vague af. And the most infuriating of all is the submission stages. Like... What. In. The. World. Even. Is. This. Many Uni might've used this App up to now, but this App is mediocre at best, does its job, but having their executions flopped.",
      "Definitely not the best app. It is convenient if you want to see your assignments but does not work 100%. The notifications barely work. I can't highlight anything in the text which is extremely important to me for creating notes. It needs a lot of work or a great update.",
      "In my previous review, I stated the app was broken. But, as of a few days ago, with little fanfare, the app was fixed. A little late, but better late than never, I guess. The app works fine, but I'm still a little sour about the app being broken for so long."

Your community doesn&#39;t need to be together to learn together! ü•≥<br><br>Reach out to us and the amazing Flipgrid community on Twitter by tagging @Flipgrid or #FlipgridFever!<br><br>In this update:<br>‚Ä¢ We&#39;ve made updates to ensure your videos are submitted correctly even when your device has connection issues.<br>‚Ä¢ Adjusted branding for an improved user onboarding flow",
    "comments":[
      "Extremely difficult to use. I mean it's a great idea to sort out lessons and response, however the execution is terrible. I can't find my response to the teacher due to moderation, but I don't even know if my response is submitted. The sorting is difficult to find and my fellow students often mistake one lesson to another due to bad design.",
      "Flipgrid is such a robust app for amplifying student voice! They keep improving this amazing free app and it just gets better and better. The disco library allows for teacher collaboration, shorts are fun ,and GridPals allow global connection. The fact that students can now splice various video clips together from the whiteboard feature, the flipping camera feature, the pull from camera roll feature added so much functionality. The Mixtapes make it possible to share highlights or compilations.",
      "I started using this app two days ago, and I already love it. It helps engage my students with each other on a face-to-face level. I also appreciate the security levels. One recommendation: I think teachers should have the option of approving videos before they are posted (like in Padlet). Thanks for this app during this Coronavirus school closing!",
      "We love the FlipGrid app! It is really easy to use! My students can reflect on questions that they may be apprehensive to answer in front of their peers. We use it to practice languages but also for the fun to do a a big search around the school! Flipgrid is constantly doing updates and adding new features to keep the Flipgrid improving! Flipgrid brings the student voice in to the classroom!!",
      "Love getting to hear my students' reflections and that they can respond at home or in school - so they have more time to process prompts and how they want to respond. It's especially nice now that we are going distance learning because we are staying connected!"

      "Couldn't speak more highly of this program. The content & material it provides is undeniably the best on the market, while being fun & engaging. I've never had any technical difficulties. I bought the full personal package a couple years ago & recently recieved a free upgrade to access all languages! It was already more than worth the purchase so I am very grateful. If you actually want to start learning a language or brush up on your skills you won't regret the purchase!",
      "When I tried to do spanish it kept telling me I was doing it wrong. I personally took spanish classes and was looking for more help. I don't think this app is really good with its audio. When I try to speak into the audio its always says \"Please move to a quiet place and speak slower\". I usually speak fast so uhhh don't know what to do then.",
      "I also had the message \"SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG\" but after trying many things all I did was delete the app. Shut off my tablet. Waited 2 mins and turned it back on to reinstall and that solved the problem. Hopefully this helps others. The App version is actually very easy to use and learn. I'm satisfied.",
      "Very happy to have all languages available and grateful that they updated my purchase with it without me having to do anything. App is fun and easy to use and it checks for the accent which is the main thing. Excited to learn French and later Tagalog, Italian, Hebrew, and all the other languages I've been wanting to learn!",
      "I haven't used it much, but this is clearly not the typical language learning app I'm used to. I finished the first core lesson and didn't hear or see a single word in English, but I'm definitely more confident in what I've learned here than anywhere else. It's interesting, and in the best way. I can't wait to keep learning. :)"

I don't know if it was a bug which need to fix or I have to pay money to get full access to the lessons",

      "I love this program! It is really easy to use and you can do a lot of things in this program, u can play a game and learn some words in that way, you can listen books and stories and see your results like how much words do you know. So ya if you want to learn language, or just some words, or just have fun by doing something interesting and not waisting your time by playing Minecraft. Go and download this app :3",
      "Very good app , but hope adding ' english - english translation \" because there are students who are intermidiate ,and wanna improve their english without any translation into their mother one .",

If you just want some fun and free learning content for your child, here it is! Whoever sees this review, must download this app. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!",
      "The content is incredible and free. No adds! Based on your child age there is a tailored learning path wonderfully crafted for your child. I am amazed by how fun and interactive the learning materials are, this can't be beat. Then there is the library were you can select content if you so desire. Thank you for an amazing tool at the hands of parents.",
      "Oh my!!! This is such a great app for my daughter personally!!!! I have tried sitting down with her for her to learn her letters and it seems she gets too distracted. But she loves this app! Withen a week of her playing and learning on this she has gotten her letters down! The coloring is great as well because when we color on paper she is getting in the lines now!! I am not one to sit my kid in front of a screen but this app has helped a lot in areas im not able to get her to focus on! Love it!",
      "Excellency in an app. No ads. No pop ups or add-ons. There are lessons for all ages and my kid learns without even realizing she's learning. It is an intuitive and brilliant way to keep kids learning while they are playing on your phone. The world would be a different place if we had more apps like this.",
      "We cancelled our subscription o ABC mouse because my daughter was so bored with it ... I love that this app is free and teaches her more than any other app we have tried. We homeschool, so it's nice to have access to things like this, especially for waiting at doctor appointments or when I forget her schoolwork at home and we eat out."

      "It's good, but it doesn't really teach you how to do something in particular. You will just answer questions. Plus, when you get an answer wrong, it brings you back at least 7 points down, but when you get it correct, you get 2-3 more points back. It depends on how much time you have to answer each question. Anyways, it's a good app if you want to memorize something. Just 1 thing I would recommend is having videos before starting a new lesson. It will help people know what to expect on lessonsüòÅ",
      "Great is fun, is a great way to relax( you can enjoy math, language arts etc.) Is addictive to play and challenge yourself. If you want to download the app it take a long time. If are going to google, safari,or any of your browser apps it will not take but a few seconds to a minute.",
      "I absolutely love IXL's website format, but the app is virtually useless. The recommendations, diagnostic and automatic suggestions disappear. You must manually look up each subject, level and category, which defeats a lot of the purpose of using this program. Instead, I much prefer to use the website on my childrens' Kindles or our laptop.",
      "This is the worst educational app I have ever used. IXL is made for practice not learning. I am fine with that, except anytime you get a problem wrong it gives you the worst explanation on how to get it right. It is very lazily made and only focuses on negative reinforcement, making it a very bad experience for anyone using it. It is WAY overpriced and hated by many kids. I don't get why IXL is used. I personally recommend Khan academy as it offers very useful lessons and positive reinforcement.",
      "Fantastic app. Its a practice app not a leaning tool as some others have assumed and are giving negative feedback. Its like reviewing a workbook and saying its not fit for purpose. Please ignore comments from those who believe an app will somehow do the job of a parent/teacher. Please come up with something similar for vocabulary too... quickly."

I have not taken many quizzes so I can't say if they contain incorrect or confusing and misleading information or not. Please review the information posted in your app.",

Or, if all the answers given were right, it would still say i was wrong. I might like doing these games for like reviews or something, but this was just bad.",
      "it's fun, but you cant add diffrent types of questions without having to pay! You used to be able to choose the quiz type. It would be nice if you didn't have to pay and true or false and regular questions get boring! I wish you could at least be able to choose the question type and/or color of choices without paying! Maybe you could only pay for things like change the music or draw the pictures! Maybe an ad, for example to make a quiz with premium features ?",

      "I saw a lot of reviews saying that text is cut off, and indeed when I first opened the app it was for me as well. To fix this go into your phone's settings and choose customization. You should at least have 2 options depending on your make of phone. I switched mine to the default font 'roboto' and now all the text shows clearly in the app.",
      "The videos are great, but sometimes there's a problem in the app, even after I finish watching certain videos such as Missing Angles \" (CA Geometry) \" and \"Simple probability: non blue marble\", it still shows they're incomplete. Please fix this issue.",
      "Love the app. The content and UI is really great. Some more features could be added though, like manually selecting video quality while streaming and downloading because sometimes the quality is so low, I cannot understand the audio and video. Also, dark mode for nighttime would really help.",
      "Love the app, I love studying , I'm a nerd like that. I'm having trouble with the videos, the sound is fine but visually it's all wrong, I can't see what's going on. I realise this is probably the fault of my phone, I just wondered if you'd heard of this issue before and would be able to help?",
      "I want to give it 5 stars for the content, idea and mission... however i can not find on the app autoplay option for videos, even worse there is no one click to go to the next video in landscape mode (like there is on youtube), which wastes a lot of energy and time, especielly while exercising (e.g. stationary bike). I will revise my review if there is an autoplay option. I am using android on samsung note phone."

If I could cast, I'd get the subscription. Until then this app gets 0 stars from me. Complete waste",

      "The recent update has changed the entire layout. Its much more confusing now with games mixed in with the episodes. The names of episodes no longer show either. When you're done watching/playing be sure to close out of the app completely or the show moght start up/continue on its own several minutes later. This is especially creepy in the evening. I'm hoping for an update/fix soon otherwise we'll be cancelling our subscription.",

      "I was really happy with the latest improvements made to this app. However, since the last update, I've started to get late notifications. Students and parents are replying to my posts or are sending me private messages but I keep receiving notifications after 1or2days. It's really upsetting, especially now with all the coronavirus&social distancing measures, when it's so important to keep in touch with our students and not lose contact with them. Could you please fix it? Thanks so much!",
      "The platform it's kind of useless. Yes, you can send your homework but it makes this job something bored and harder than the normal way. Normally, me have a lot of bugs sending files or attaching it, you have to refresh, sometimes it just take a \"phantom\" file that yes, it have the original name of the file, but if you open it, it's empty. I hope this to be solved, thanks.",
      "I'm a language teacher and I've been using Edmodo for years. It's been working fine until this school year. It glitches a lot, especially when my students need to log in without using Google. I'd still recommend it to people though. It's generally pretty easy to use and I can locate my previous assignments and tests pretty easily from the library.",
      "This app is ALWAYS glitching and for a second i thought it was my phone but its not because a lot of my friends that are using edmodo have the same exact problem. There is a bunch of bugs and errors. In my opinion this app isnt helpful at all everytime i get on this app it always tells me i dont have internet connection, and its always glitching. I really do not like this app.",
      "This would be a fabulous app, IF they could get the glitches worked out, it has been very inconsistent some days it works and the students collaborate and conversation flows, most days however, students and myself as the teacher do not get posts, are unable to post, are being knocked out of the app....etc. I gave it a 3 for the potential of what it may be able to offer one day."

      "Would be 5 stars on computer. But on Samsung it doesn't work. I can't even get past downloading it, and I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A! The reason why is because it's slow to download, and it would say \"Checking for Wifi\" when I clearly had Wifi! I read plenty of the reviews and see why people are upset with it. It's also very outdated. It hasn't been updated since March of 2018, and that was over a year ago! On computer it's amazing, and I'm on level 18. If only it would work on Samsung.",
      "This app is stated to work on my samsung tab. It don't. I've had numerous emails with Lexia. They seem to need to practice on their own app. As their comprehension of the written language seems to need extensive work. I have clearly stated the issue with the app. They keep asking for teachers email. I can't even get that far in the app. That question and situation is moot. They have said for years they are working on making this app available. Yet won't get it working for listed android devices",
      "For as much money as schools pay, it's insane that this app works as poorly as it does. Just downloaded it from the Play Store and it lets me log in but then kicks me out saying the version is out of date. I just downloaded it. Wife is a teacher, said the poor performance of the app is well known",
      "Can't enter e-mail address to log in. Special characters can be entered at the prompt for teacher e-mail but not actual letters. So basically , after typing in the address I was left with \"@.\" which gets me nowhere. Fix your app.",
      "It's novel & bearable for grades 1 thru maybe 3rd, maybe. Beyond that her voice gets annoying, her speaking pace is painfully slow, is it condescending or is that our imagination? The slightest mistake sends one into a monotonous loop to then start over. The school blames the child for not wanting to use it, but seriously it's horrible, why would they want to. Oh then one finish levels & come September it sends them back down to redo the horrible content with that awful voice again. Year after godforsaken year."

      "This is an update to a review I wrote on March 15 regarding the issues I was having with this app. I uninstalled it off all my devises and reinstalled it. It is still a little temperamental on tab, takes longer to open and switch between learning activities, but works great on the others. My 4 year old, who could read before this, has really mastered some the reading exercises. I had to put her in the 1st grade level of learning. My 2 year old is good at math and has really benefited from the math games. If you are having issues you may want to uninstall and then reinstall the app. Also, check your security settings, they can delay your app response times.",
      "I usually don't write reviews but man has this experience been frustrating! I signed up for ABCmouse due to the corona virus to get the kids learning something while they're at home quarantining and it has been a nightmare! The main issue is that the app consistently freezes. No matter what! I have to close the app and reopen to get it working again and then sure enough, they tap on something and... You guessed it. Frozen again! Not sure if you understand exactly how frustrating it is to have a 3 and a 5 year coming to you every 5 minutes screaming \"It's not working again!\" especially when you yourself are working from home or in a meeting. I'm definitely not continuing my subscription and would advise anybody else to look elsewhere until they get some solid developers on their app.",
      "DECEITFUL. I saw an offer for a month's free trial after downloading app. However, I had to provide my credit card details to gain access to the month's free trial. I chose the yearly subscription which I believe would only come into effect after experiencing the month's free trial.To my surprise they immediately charged me for the year. Is this how a free trial work? That's not free trial it's a month free. False advertising. Extremely dissatisfied. Opening app and loading content is slow.",
      "Terrible. Is it better than sitting your kids in front of cartoons? Yes. But by a smidgeon. The claims that this enhances literacy, math, etc, are absolutely ludicrous. There's indeed a ton of content, but it's absolute rubbish. Especially noteworthy are the UX, which is an unmitigated disaster, and the technical issues (on what's otherwise a really low-tech game app), which are positively dismal, both on the app and the web version. Don't fool yourself for a second thinking that this has any sort of educational value, on any conceivable level.",
      "App freezes A LOT ! Or simply will not load . Should definitely make an update to it because it is VERY frustrating . Spent about $69 a year on this so my son could learn while I am working from home and he doesn't have access to my computer while I work so I figure this would be great for his tablet . It doesn't work on his tablet because it freezes or just simply won't load, so I put it on my phone and yup does the same thing . Looks like I am not the only one with this issue . Not happy."

How do I bring up the menu?\r\nYou can bring up the menu by swiping from the left edge of the screen, or pressing the menu key (if your device has one).\r\n\r\n2. How do I disable vibration when I tap on a button?\r\nOpen the menu and click on settings. Under the 'Skin' category unselect 'Vibrate on keypress'\r\n\r\n3. How do I load apps like PlySmlt2 or Inequalz?\r\nTo load any file to your calculator you need to first download it to your SD card or internal storage on your device.

Apps for the 84+CSE will end in *.8ck or *.8xk.\r\n\r\n4. I'm missing fraction options when I press Alpha+F1! How do I get these fraction options?\r\nFraction options (and the rest of the Alpha+FN menus) are only available on OS 2.55 MP. Wabbitemu allows you to download both 2.43 and 2.55 MP. You can check your OS version by hitting '2nd' then '+'. Then press enter to go to the about screen.

The problem now is that it's stuck on the ram cleared screen on boot-up and won't leave it. As I say, it works great when it works, but when it doesn't work, it's really doesn't work.",

      "It is amazing when it works... but it doesn't work too often. Recently it glitches on the home screen and the app closes itself. I reenter it and see it is making me reinstall the file. Then after I do it the same thing happens again. Needs some patches or updates. I have the galaxy s10 plus, so it's not my phone that's the issue.",
      "I downloaded the app and got it all pulled up but once it was on my screen I cannot push any buttons. Its like it's frozen on where it say \"RAM CLEARED\" and won't go away. So I uninstalled it and then restarted my phone and downloaded it again but it's doing the same thing and isn't letting me do anything. So in my experience this app is trash but yet my classmates use this app and it works just fine for them but I don't get why it won't work for me.",
      "Just like a ti84 except it is very bady calibrated. To the point where the keyboard is almost unuseable, this issue has grown worse and worse until now i can't even use it. I loved this app but this control issue has ruined it for me."

My daughter was having trouble early in the year, so her teacher recommended using Splash Math to practice at home. When she finished the school year, she was one of the best in the class!

      "New to this app! I remember BrainPOP from when I was a kid. I loved viewing the movie of the week with my 4 and 7 year old and doing the quizzes with them. Upon exploring the app more I tried clicking the free movies button and it oddly doesn't work, even though the rest of the app worked flawlessly. It would be great if this could be fixed so I can decide if I want to buy anything extra in the app.",
      "Ota really good for edication and small learning for kids and all ages besides adults of coures! BrainPOP jr is really good accept you really need to get rid of the log in and subscribe because my parents and I think its a little unessicery for an adicationel app!!",
      "You have to PAY money for most episodes it's so unfair because if you'll just want to watch a video about butterflies you either have to pay $3 per month or $7 per month I suggest don't download this cuz you can only watch certain it episodes and because the quizzes so hard like they say do you want to do the easy quiz or the hard quiz both of them AR hard so I don't know why they did that",

I can't stand it even if my child loves it. So sorry, no, 1 minute of trial was enough for me. I like homer app better as it has more individuality to it and lovely songs. And by the way, I can use basic trial version for free all the time not only 7 days.",
      "SCAM, registered on 12, turned out app is rubbish. Tried to cancel on the website -you can't because I paid through website not play store. Sent an email on 17 to cancel subscription. Received lame email what to do if paid with each method of payment but message said clearly to not to charge me. On 19/03 got receipt for $60 despite originally it meant to be $5 a month and I got charged even though I asked to cancel it few days before it wasn't done. Look at the comments, loads of people same!!!",
      "The games is great but it kept froze and stop working which have to close and reopen again, very dissapointed and cant get my refund despite i just paid and experience all this trouble on 1st day. Definitely wont continue my subscription and not worth paying the money",
      "Wayyyy too glitchy. Freezes constantly. Can't go even a couple minutes without getting stuck. Great idea, but too frustrating. Should be taken down until the technical issues are resolved.",
      "A mistake was made and we seem to have purchased the app. We have never even attempted to use the app other than the first day looking through it. It never worked on my device and now getting a refund is close to impossible. I was given a help link and nothing has ever come out of it. 60 dollars down the drain and no Support for the incompetent app or refund."

      "Great content for my 3 and 4yr olds to start learning. Unfortunately it let's let down by the fact that it regularly freezes on the 'loading' screens. Between every game we need to restart the app. We are using a brand new, high quality tablet so this shouldn't be the issue.",
      "My 2 and half year old loves this app. And has lots of great homework material for parent to do with the kids. But it seems to have a couple of problems some of the games will freeze or gets stuck on the loading page. Also I think it would be good if you had to hold the back button for a couple of seconds to exit a game.",
      "Everything is too small for a 3yo to press. My son gets so frustrated at all the \"game overs\" from pressing slightly off-target that he won't play certain games e.g. Word Grid. Not sure why when there is so much whitespace around the small box in the middle. Why not just fullscreen that area? Also one of the games in Lesson 1 seems far too hard. He's only just learning how to recognize \"m\" and the game requires him to match whole words with small, unclear pictures.",
      "Although I thought the educational content of this game was great, it requires too much manual dexterity. This, not the instruction, was the source of my child's frustration. Many of the interaction points were extremely small. A lot of the time, this was clearly an intentional design choice. There was a ton of blank space on the screen, so the designers could have easily made buttons larger. Maybe this game is okay on s tablet, but it is unusable for a small child on a phone.",
      "Can't get on the trial - no support. I subscribed to get on the trial period having heard good things. The app says I haven't subscribed and wont let us do anything. I've on multiple occasions tried to contact reading eggs, only once receiving a reply, to which they asked for more information. I sent the requested info but heard nothing more, not even to my follow up prompt email. Cancelled my subscription before the payments started. Subscribed a month ago and no idea what the app is like"

      "Amazing app and function created by Samsung! As always, I'm thoroughly impressed by Samsung and how they continue to provide great products, services, knowledge, and charity to it's customers. My only issue is that about a well ago after i started the, \"Earn rewards by charging, \" and in a week, I haven't earned any rewards to donate to the charity causes. I know my phone is plugged in charging, otherwise i would not have the battery life to even write this review üòÇ Thanks!",
      "Love the whole idea and purpose. Especially the wallpaper donation feature. However it keeps resetting, asking to be turned on over and over. Isn't it supposed to remain turned on? Kind of annoying, to have to do it over and over and over. I am quite frankly almost turned off by it now... Please let me know if I am Doing it wrong or something.... If a glitch... How to fix???? Thank you",
      "I love the goal of this app, it's awesome. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the app doesnt always play adds while charging. Haven't had any problems or errors, no malware or anything. It didnt download on it's own as it has happened to others apparently, my phone directly asked if I wanted to download it, so I'm not sure what people think is going on. I totally support Samsung and its efforts in helping the UN (which isnt a communist entity at all for those that think it is smh).",
      "I think this is a great way to raise funds to help these different initiatives!! I also like that you can choose which cause you would like to donate the money to. My only thought is to have a section where we can go to watch ads and raise more money. I only see 3 ads at a time and once I've watched/clicked on them I have to go searching for more. It would be more convenient and we would be able to raise more money if they were all readily available in one spot.",
      "Not bad if you don't mind the adds. They are silent so it doesn't startle you or any thing. Money generation is verry slow but definitely rewarding. If all I have to do is let the adds do their thing and I can donate even what little it makes then great it's better then nothing!!"

Its a sentence along the lines of: \"Buy once and use forever, no extra payment. Have you already purchase other version?\". This is kind of broken english and i have no idea what its supposed to mean. Is it implying that there are multiple versions of this app and that if i bought one already i get premium in this app as well or something else?",

      "I've been using this everyday for 8 days straight now. Same thing happens every time. It's good for about half hour or so and then it goes all glitchy and frozen . Not really impressed with it since I was billed for the whole year and it isn't even working right. I get the 'program not responding' message a lot. And a few times for a couple hours it doesn't even recognize it is hearing sound at all after working perfectly So you have to stop and try again either much later or the next day.",
      "sure it's a good app. I only have a few complaints about the premium membership. May I add, the majority of the lessons and songs in order to access them, you need the membership. I want to learn not pay money every month. Mabye if you made some changes then this rating would not be so bad. The five minute work outs? Yes they help. A little. I can predict that the premium membership is where they make most of their money. Most likely because most peopel want a full version. Thank you.",
      "This is a really good app for people who (like me) are new to piano and don't know it! But the reason why i gave it 4 stars are these reasons: 1. Practice mode. So if you mess up a song twice, practice mode turns on.. And i wish, that you get a option if you want it on.. like, a \"would you like to turn on practice mode\" option whenever you mess up two times. Cause that would really help! (P.s. the practice mode is just annoying me too much, so i had to write this)",
      "This is a good app, it really helped me learn the basic 5 notes but after you do all the basic courses you have to pay to do more. After i completeed the basic 5 courses it showed me a video saying I could now play any songs I wanted, well that's not true because I have to pay to play those supposeded songs I can now play. I would not recommend this app to anyone because you don't even get the full experience you want.",
      "I absolutely love this app I use it all the also if you have a subscription you can use if on multiple devices and create new accounts with the same subscription the best part is you can play millions of songs and always adding more!!! It's worth every penny and isn't very expensive my first day I was playing Ode to joy and it's like nothing you learn in the blink of an eye and I have so much fun no problems yet thank you JoyTunes for creating this amazing app!!!"

      "I am absolutely happy with this app. It can identify any plant, tree, flower, or weed and very quickly. If it's a close call it will give several options to choose from letting your eye decide. It also let's you contribute your photos to the database of photos if they don't have many of that plant. It also tells a little about the plant where it lives best, best feeding and watering practices. I do recommend Picture This to identify plants you see around you every day.",
      "So far it's been a good app. Its 7 out of 10 times right when I take a rough picture, but honestly some of the plants I take pictures of I do it to try and trick it to see how it responds. Im a groundskeeper so honestly I would trust it if I had to give it a shot in the dark. I also like that if it doesn't know it I can suggest a name or ask. HOWEVER I do not recommend any app looking for edible versus poisonous plants, like some people will try to use this for.",
      "I kind of like the app at the start and was excited to use it.However, it cannot identify several of my plants and at times you still have to guess which one from the options and it makes me doubtful of the accuracy of this app. When I suggest a name esp for those I know of, it won't reflect the name, instead it reflects the very general one like 'hen and chicks'.I was not very happy and didn't want to suscribe but I missed to cancel before the 7th day and so yeah, I was automatically charged.üòî",
      "Great app at identifying plants! I would give it 5 stars of it had a \"notes\" section for you to add other information you like to keep on hand. I use plants as herbal remedies, so if I had a place to write the benefits, ways to use it and their actions, I would change my 4 to a 5 asap!",
      "The app is NOT FREE at all üò°.After getting information about 2 plants,I was not able to get information aboutthe third plant onwards. The app everytime takes me to a page where I am asked to collect ID's. I collected .5 ID by watching an ad hoping I would get information about plants but in vain.So, what's the use of watching that ad if it doesn't solve my purpose ? I'm not going to pay.Is there any other way which solves my purpose otherwise I'll have to uninstall the app ?Kindly let me know"

      "It's a decent app. However, seeing my classes assignments are very important, yet they do not allow it. They could make this better, and I bet at least 25% of the students can make a better app. Great job. First you lend a high school 20 million FOR CONSTRUCTION, and let them add new features, instead of books and such for students, now this. Pinellas you need to up your game.",
      "The interface is easy to use and understand but ugly. You can't check individual class assignments apart from the calendar. You might as well just set a shortcut to portal on your internet browser because this app doesn't have full functionality.",
      "super bad set up, when you want to scroll, it doent let you, and when you swipe one way or the other, it only goes one way, I could make a app much better then this sorry of an app for students and adults, peoples money went to a bad cause that people won't even want to use because it just sucks. I will continue to use focus online because the app just sucks. good luck other people who want to try to use the app, just use the focus online, and not the app, don't even waste your time on this",
      "I think the app needs more work because there is no individual access to our classes and also not enough selection to were we want to go on it with out it turning to something different but I will continue using focus on the computerüòä",
      "Not really useful. It's nice to have all the links together but it is very old looking."
