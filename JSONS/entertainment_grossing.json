      "Streaming to tv has improved a lot, but you still cannot decide what level of HD you want to stream based on the bandwidth you have. You can do it for downloads, sort of (low/med/high), but this doesn't really tell you anything except for how many hours you can store. This is useless for phone users who may want to tailor the quality to their phone's resolution. Also, I think the older Simpsons episodes are still oddly cropped to fit 16:9, which cuts off some of the image.",
      "Lots of content, but the app is trash. The app is not at all feature-rich, and it is often glitchy. Most shows are 2min long, and it stops playback after every show. This drives my kids nuts, which in turn drives me nuts. I dont want to have to find and play a new episode every 2 min or less. Netflix has set the bar on what to expect from a streaming app, and disney cannot compete. Casting to another device, is never a smooth experience.",
      "Update March 22: after downloading an update for the app, now I can't watch anything. The audio come through but the screen just stay black. For all the shows and movies. Please fix. If you haven't update, don't do it!! __________________ Does not work in note 10 I have a note 10 plus and I get the error 83. Still waiting for the fix. Thanks.",
      "App almost always has issues loading, they don't have all the promised content and the downloads keep stalling. Update: Canceled subscription due to issues, but reactivated to give it another shot. Same issues, and now it will also not download content. Anything I want to load just sits in the queue waiting, verified settings and internet connection. Some new content has been added, but there is still quite a few gaps. They also seriously need to fix the formatting on the Simpsons episodes.",
      "Got the app when it originally came out a few months back to watch the mandalorian... But the moment the season stopped I tapped out because the app does not work. It freezes. Audio de-syncs. Not worth the money when other streaming services can provide subtitles, and fluid streaming. And if you look up the problem it just falls back onto your internet speeds... which I do not have a problem with. I regularly sit at 24mbps. Disappointed and will be uninstalling again."

      "Good quality and a pretty decent interface, but the ads are ridiculous. Most streams force you to watch a 30 seconds ad before you can actually start viewing what your use the app for. From there, it just gets worse. I've frequently been subjected to SEVEN straight ads of 15 to 30 seconds in duration. That means a few full minutes of interruption, which always come at the worst time of the steam and they aren't skippable in any way. Oh, and you'll see the same handful of ads over and over.",
      "Was good starting out. But now I can't see certain people for whatever reason. I can go to other streamers and see them just fine, but for one group which I also follow on YouTube as well as Twitch, I can hear them, but not see them. This is really irritating because I used to be able to see them, but after an update it leaves me with a black window. The streamers belive its because they're using iPhones and I'm using a Samsung, but that seems like a really stupid reason. Please fix.",
      "Great behind the scenes and you can multitask with a background window, which many will love. Also extra points go to this app cause this can livestream certain games others can't. The only reason that it doesnt have five stars is that it has a certain delay and its missing some features other apps have but if does i will be glad to fix this rating to five stars",
      "So the content is great. App works okay, if you sit your phone up, don't touch it, and preferably stream only audio. If you go into pop up, it will lag and sometimes just stop. It will lag and stutter all the time, no matter the stream. It loses your place in VODs for channels you're subscribed to while you're watching then if *anything* else happens on your phone, and now, it's been playing BLARING ads over top of streams I'm subscribed to. I'd love to list more issues but I'm out of space.",
      "Update on Feb 24 (recent) killed audio only and background audio play on my s8. It was working fine for months/years until the update yesterday. Hopefully some bug they can fix quik. Already tried reinstalling the app and nothing. Other than that it's been working fine. Will update when fixed. And yes background audio is enabled."

      "No videos i select apparently have sound files with them. My internet connection is famtastic and all my other apps and devices are woking fine. Even your in videos advertisements are working phenomonally, but when it gets to the part i paid for the soundbyte goes out and its starting to make me angry. Im considering cancelling my subscription.",
      "The HBO app constantly kicks me out of the video saying they can't play the video, forces me to go back to then relaunch the video. I watched a movie where I had to do this about 50 times no joke, this is the most annoying Thing of this app. It would be one thing if it didn't happen on every show but it happens every single program I've ever watched and HBO since the moment I installed this app. I hope HBO has a fix for this because I can't believe I'm the only one that this is happening to",
      "Worst streaming service. Every interaction is frustrating. Too bad your burying good content with terrible ux. Rewind is frustrating. Navigating is frustrating. Getting kicked out is frustrating. Video quality is really bad. Loads forever. None of my other streaming apps do this I have solid fiber connection.",
      "I'm paying $25 a month so that ten minutes into a movie the app can stop working. Permanently. Turn the console off, uninstall the app, switch to a computer, it doesn't matter, the playback ends and won't go past the marker it first buffered at. And yes, it's across all my devices. I can watch Netflix, Hulu and Prime all in 4K but HBO, the most expensive one, crashes constantly. According to the help line, my internet download/upload and latency is more than DOUBLE what HBO requires to playback HD video. Their solution? To email me later when the \"app developers\" think of something. So answer me something. Why am I paying a monthly rate that is bonkers expensive compared to other streaming services for an app that quite actually has more buffering than a movie streaming site that will show me this title for FREE? The only thing this app has going for it is the original content which, while great, you can find anywhere else online with less buffering. And that doesn't cost you $25 a month.",
      "Frustrating interface that is not intuitive. No movie information page is available, it just immediately plays the movie with any touch, useless. Category organization is not employed unless an alphabetical only listing of every movie is the only category. Chromecast functionality appears to work."

      "On 3/17 I paid for a 3 month introductory offer for 4.99 a month. To this point I have been unable to get on Stars and watch a single show of the only reason I signed up. Every time I try to sign in it gives me a message stating there is already an account under that name. I was on the phone on hold (supposed to be 20 minutes) for over an hour no never receive any answer or assistance. They took my money out for payment. Why can't I log in on my tablet or o my android. It's downloaded ants the problem? Barbara Tamburo",
      "So irritated! I have the app on my phone and smart TV. When I try to play app on my TV it doesn't load completely and when i can finally get to the show I'm looking for it won't load to play now. Been working okay fir a while but now i can't watch anything! So frustrating that I give up! Oh and no closed captioning?! Not cool at all! Please help!",
      "App immediately takes me to create account screen where I'm stuck in a loop. I put in my email and password and of course it says an account already exists with that email. When I try to back out it gives me a message saying I've already paid but if I want to access content I have to input my information. There are no other options on this screen.",
      "The app certainly gets the job done, however it's far from the smoothest experience. It can be difficult to find new things of interest to watch, particularly without proper genre browsing and no recommendations. As well, streaming to a Chromecast is finicky. There's no option to skip intros or recaps and there's no autoplay for watching episodes back to back. Episodes also occasionally start in the wrong language. Hopefully these things will get fixed in the future.",
      "I wish they would give an option to disable autoplay...this is a common feature on streaming apps! At least play videos from my playlist! There's a lot of older content too. I probably won't renew at the end of my subscription period. The app also uses over a gigabyte of storage...why? Netflix uses 212mb. Disney+ uses 345mb, and prime uses 627mb...smh"

      "This CBS media streaming app does what it is supposed to: stream content, both free and subscription-based. I started using it on a Moto G7 and now on a Samsung A50, both running Android 9, and it works just fine. Do I wish there weren't any ads? Sure. Did I know what I was signing up for? Yes. Yes I did. So, unless something legitimately wrong or bad happens, I'm going to give it 5 stars.",
      "I have to say that I really have enjoyed Star Trek Picard and Discovery, but I have an issue that needs attention please. We need a way to access the \"Full screen\" mode. Laptops are not like televisions, so the \"widescreen\" mode you have is reducing the Laptop screen size. We appreciate your assistance with this problem. Can we have an option please to exit \"widescreen\" and go to \"Full screen\" mode in the Future? A small request hopefully, as we do pay for the streaming service. Thank you!",
      "This app is not the same as it was the first time I tried it.The first time there were not as many ads as there are now, and it played and casted better than it does now. The show I try to watch has problems casting, when it does work it disconnects then I start it again and instead of starting where it left off it starts at the beginning. By the time you get the program back to where you were it cuts off again. Very aggravating! Thinking about canceling this app just not worth the aggravation",
      "The free access is bogus. I signed up for the free trial & I'm supposed to have limited commercials. I don't. I have constant commercials just like before. False advertising to lure people in. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Cancelling trial since no sense in having it when everything is the same as the free app. Just when I think this app can't get any worse it did. Trying to watch the young & the restless & for the past 45 min I've been watching nothing but commercials which I hate.",
      "I just did your new update and its horrible. Cant even watch my soap. It keeps stopping for long periods! It was fine before, dont fix what isnt broken!!! Now its 3/19/2020 and its doing it again after doing your app update. All i get is a circle in the middle of the screen going around. No other apps have that problem!!! You need an update to fix the update!!! 3/20/2020, I still cant watch Y&R!!!! I get circle going around in middle of screen! It stops for a second, cant understand to 2 words."

      "Its meh, it has about 10 ads per episode, but they are at the very beginning and at the end, 5 at the start 5 at the end, so it's not that bad. Where else are you gonna watch anime for free? But my worst complaint is the buffering, it buffers like once every 2 or 3 minutes, and it takes around 10 seconds in total to stop. And I have pretty good internet. But if it wasn't that frequent or didnt exist, then I would very easily rate it 4 or 5 stars.",
      "I really like this streaming service, but on the phone app it is filled with issues. But my major problem is that it takes so damn long to load and still when it loads sometimes it stops in the middle of an episode, or the video stops and the audio goes back a few seconds and you have to wait for the audio to catch up. And in pc you have none of these problems, so I always keep thinking, why pay for this since you can just go on pc and use an adblocker. I am really frustrated with this app.",
      "The app really has a problem. Whenever I click on any video, the app tells me that its stopped working and that I need to reload. I've uninstalled and installed the app multiple times and the problem still won't go away. I really want to watch anime when I'm not at home but can't because Crunchyroll has \"stopped working\". I'm not even going to try anymore. Maybe get that fixed, please. However, this is a great place to watch all of your favorites for free and you get new episodes really quick :)",
      "I enjoy the app for the most part and I love the selection. Although I cannot go a single day without there being constant loading and buffering issues. There are apps like the Netflix one that I've never had an issue with, but does the same thing as this one... stream shows. It baffles me as to how this problem has yet to be fixed after reading so many others who also have this issue. I just want to be able to watch my shows without it constantly stopping and starting. First world problems aye.",
      "Nice app...when you actually get to watch it. Ads in a free version are fine, when they work. A 25 sexond ad takes about 2 minutes as it buffers constantly. Some ads run fine. Some of them need me to restart the episode as they just don't play. It's not every ad by the way. The figurine site ad works fine, but the insurance one freezes at about the 6 second mark for example. Pretty sure it isn't my connection as well. Otherwise the app works as intended."

      "When I top up the credit the money was delayed and when I tried to press the button it actually move straight away resulting in one waste of chance. Too much lagging issue. Claw does not move and the price per game is too expensive. not recommended. Help page doesn't really do what it needs to. Free play ticket is pretty useless as most of the games cannot play, and the terms did not mention how to use it. Overall very bad experience.",
      "EDITED When I first started this app it was really fun, and there was a nice balance between hard and easy machines. Now all the claws do is lightly nudge items. I'm giving this a one star rating, not because they've raised the difficulties on machines. But because I've had a charge issue, I've been emailing support for the last month and a half with no response to help me. All they did was set my account to -50,000tp so I can no longer play. But without any reason why, and not one email back.",
      "This game is very difficult. The claws are super tricky to figure out and generally are very weak. Most of the prizes are hard to actually win and will take more than 2-3 tries to actually get. That being said, the game gives you tons of free plays which helps learn the cranes, and winning is possible. Patience is the key here, watch other players try, and learn where the claws have their strengths.",
      "Overpriced gameplay. I can get play this outside for 1/3 of the price and have a confirmed official plushie if I spend 50 or more in the arcade. (Singapore) Also rigged gameplay. I witnessed and watched someone who pushed the prize to the edge which only require 1 more try to drop it down then SUDDENLY that particular claw machine is up for maintenance. Also they are using transparent hard plastic around the drop zone to make the drop harder making the prize bounce back. (looking carefully)",
      "While I enjoy challenges, the way these are set up are so difficult it's nearly impossible to ever win anything, making it become less and less enjoyable to play until now after having this only a few months I look at it and think why bother? There are better ways to waste your money than this."

Dick Grayson has always stayed true to what he learned as Robin and his code is simple – if you&#39;re breaking the law on his turf, expect a swift, painful trip to Arkham.  While everyone&#39;s favorite Titan keeps the peace, we continue to improve DC Universe with new features, bug fixes and better performance.",

      "Fantastic library but a terrible UI and poor design make finding anything unnecessarily difficult. Everything is buried under confusing arbitrary menus and frequent crashes and connection issues are frustrating. I'm not sure how they even put out such a poorly designed app in this day and age. Other than being a messy cluttered unorganized disaster the comics themselves look amazing and the panels are easy to navigate. Edited to one star because the download function doesn't even work.",
      "This app eats through data like krazy. Even with streaming and downloads set to SD, the app just chewed through 12GB's of data in the last 5 hours. Plus the downloads don't even work. Anything I download won't play after the first few minutes, it'll just stop playing, and the support page I'm sent to isn't any help at all. Really wish they would fix this app.",
      "It's a great app, but the search engine and browser categories could be better. Seem like they remove some of the movies. I feel like all the movies and animated series should be at my disposal. Paying $75/year, the app should be much more better than what it is.",
      "Not easily able to get in and out of even though do not seem to be able to get that to or access to somewhat of a disappointment seeing how the payments are always paid the mailing address in the person is denied so who is paying for itI noticed comic books or regular kept up on this app even on my television I like that I also like the fact that I get to see the cartoons they don't seem to be kept up-to-datebut other and being unable to get in and out of I don't mind I'll 3 stars out of five",
      "I was very disappointed to see the lack of DC animation movies. They have some but nowhere near of what's in their library. I subscribed to watch Harley Quinn, which was great, but not being able to watch the recent JL animation movies that came out in the last 10 years made me unsubscribe."

Yet, the video stream was having issues, unable to access other parts of the app. It was frustrating. They haven't refunded my money. I am still trying to get my money back.",

      "The mobile version of this app is frustrating. It's great when it decides to work but 95% of the time, the app wont load, when it does load and play a video, it is constantly freezing. It also will freeze and then skip back by itself and replay audio that has past and then start playing again just to freeze again. Can we please have someone look into this and actually fix it????!!!",
      "I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. The episodes. Don't play without glitches, if they play at all. One minute I can watch on my TV, the next I can't. Then there's the mobile app, which is a total loss. But what is REALLY effing annoying and weird, is that an episode is English dubbed one second, and Japanese subbed the next. And it happens, WHILE YOU'RE watching!!! I appreciate funimarion for providing fans with dub options, but the app is a disaster. And the website is even worse.",
      "App needs work. Clicking on things like \"recently add\" takes you to list that keeps refreshing when you get to the end. What looks like 100s of shows is really just the same 15 shows repeated again and again. Click on a show and going back takes you all the way to the top of the list. There is also video playback issues... forever to load, pause and can't continue. Want to go back or skip forward a few seconds, nope, video stops working. Overall just a poor UI. Also needs a night mode.",
      "This is my second review. I noticed you respond regularly to these however instead of \"talk to customer support\", \"sorry you're having a bad time.\" and shrugging off doing something about it put some effort into fixing the app or just take it down. You have all the clear consistent information you need to figure it out: laggy, freezes, slow, bad resolution ect. It's not us it's you and we would dearly love for you to fix it so we can actually enjoy the content you provide.",
      "I have this app on my phone, it's really awesome. I love it, but it won't let me subscribe even on the website, and I would like to. Sometimes when I go to a different page it's just blank, and I have to start all over. Not all the episodes of some anime are in English and I'm not really into reading subtitles so I have started some and don't finish. Other than that I deal with it and will continue watching, and trying to subscribe."

      "Always stops my movies/shows and says \"sorry this video isn't available right now\" . Then I have to close out of the app completely & get back on. It'll work for some time then stop again. Glad I'm only testing out the free trial. I've already cancelled it & will definitely not be spending my money on something that should be free anyways! I also don't like the fact that you can't start a favorites list or anything like that. Not worth $10+ I can tell you that right now.",
      "The app would be a good one if the message \"Sorry video is unavailable\" would stop popping up when I'm into a show. And the app is always buffering. I don't have this issue with any of my streaming app but BET+.It's not one show it's everyone I watch. If they could fix that issue I will give them 5 stars but now they will get 1.",
      "Not working. I just downloaded tonight I verified my email watched an episode of a show and it played the same episode again it didn't play the next episode tried to go and hit play myself and still not working very disappointed thankfully in the trial but def not going to pay for it when I am already having problems.",
      "Ridiculous! I had my tril, then paid the 9.99 and this application hasn't worked since or my smart TV or my phone. All it says is \" something went wrong\" like others also I see! This application needs to be fixed or I want a refund.",
      "My payment was taken for this app today and now it wont even let me in and none of the videos play straight through you always get the message that the video isnt available. I wish I would have canceled before the payment was taken and it seems to be very limited selection to choose from its annoying"

      "this app is painful to use. showtime needs to hire a UX designer who actually watches shows from an app. the search field is buried in a menu. If you add a show to your list, it's hard to access the full series so that you can watch/download new shows (you can only do this by finding the search field and searching for the show again). You can't add a series to your list, just individual episodes. When you're starting a new series it lists the episodes in reverse chronological order. I guess this makes sense if you've been watching the whole time and are just looking for new episodes, but for starting a new series (especially since you can only find episodes by starting with the search field), it's annoying to always start with the last season, and then have to scroll all the way to the end to get to the first episodes. wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so hard to get there in the first place. also, it's easy to forget this format (maybe it's just me), so frequently when i start a new series i'm starting with the last episode of the first season. I could go on but why bother. Its nice that you can download shows and watch when you're offline. app gets 1 extra star for that feature.",
      "Crashes every 5 minutes says\"playback interrupted\"Then makes me log in again. Once I sign back in I dont know where I left off, it wont show you either.You have to scroll through each episode to see where you left off. When it finally does play it says loading and lasts for 30 seconds or more every few minutes.The shows are great if you are ever able to actually watch them.Watch it through prime it's so much better, it doesnt crash and when you hit play it picks right back up where you left off.",
      "I am at my wit's end with this app, it says there isn't enough space on my phone to download episodes, despite having a ton of space left on my phone. The app will also randomly sign me out for no reason, and if I back out of the app to check a notification while I'm watching a show, 1 of 2 things happens:1. it actually plays with no errors, exactly where I left off in the show. 2. A playback error occurs and I have to restart the episode. Absolutely ridiculous.",
      "Horrible! Crashes all the time. Constantly buffers. When you come back to a show, it doesn't keep the place your left off. It doesn't even keep track what episode you are on! I have Netflix, hulu, Prime video, HBO and they all work great! Unlike Showtime!!",
      "The layout and the way this app functions needs ALOT of work. It cant even remember what episode you were watching you have to manually search for it and then select it. THEN if you go out of the app for any reason it cancels playback and you have to do the search all over again. Then before you watch anything it asks if you are sure you want to watch without using wifi... EVERY SINGLE TIME."

On the plus side it is entertaining and I could see it be a great platform for musicians, dj and comedians! I would love to get to try the Dolphin Anymoji :-)",
      "So, I like the app, but i can't say i love it, when you get to do the face stuff, It has bad quality, so it is hard to make it look sad, so this app isn't bad, but i wish it had better quality, next, you can only use a few faces, and that is sad, you can't even play Jojo Siwa!😭😧😠 Stop making it to where you can use only 3 faces.",
      "I really like this app but, it is also laggy on my phone and I can barely see the settings, and when I stick my tongue out it doesn't, I am not trying to be mean but, can you fix that? Thank you! And I don't know if it is only laggy on my phone. Thank you!",
      "You can only do a free trial for three days!!😭 And then you have to pay $60 a year!😡😭 The bad thing is that I REALLY wanted this app, but nope! Way too much for an app... If the creators see this comment please make the app either cheaper, or ACTUALLY free..",
      "I love it, now I dont have to but an iPhone. Definitely not as great quality as an iphone. But I'm so impressed how this is the almost the same thing as iPhones. I love how you dont have to pay to use the thing, I like how theres free ones! Definitely considered for you guys to get this app awesome and I'm still amazed. ❤🥳"

      "The amount of content is not enough for the price asked. I love the concept of this app but it falls short. First, cable providers should not be involved at all. We stream in order to get away from cable companies. Also, there are not enough novelas. I feel that this app would be great if the whole catalogue of novelas(especially classics) was available to stream. I was hoping to find an app that would let me binge on all the novelas possible.",
      "It was working fine then the last few weeks on Roku episodes started flickering in and out. I have also had the issue of watching NOVELA and they remove them and I'm halfway through. Do you guys not keep track on the audience? I pay for this and its frustrating that shows are removed. But older shows remain. **NOW on Roku it said if you had cable you need to download app. I don't have cable. I removed and then re-added channel and I'm locked out of shows on my list. ***Must fix!",
      "It was working fine. But when I stopped paying it for 2 days..it cancelled then I went to pay for it and now it won't let me watch my shows because it's says \"You have not payed\" but I have and I don't want them getting my money from my card if I won't be able to watch my shows.",
      "The app works as it's supposed to. My main issue is you pay for this service and still have to watch alot of ads.... you can't skip them... cannot fast forward or rewind without watching one or two... for $10 a month??",
      "It's very great I can watch my favorite novelas but it's not working for me it says Everytime I click it it says it's not disponible in my region idk what that means"

      "Terrible. You open the app and doesn't let you play. It immediately wants you to buy the pro option. You can't play unless you buy it. This makes me think that there probably isn't just a free play option. Edit: found out that this company stole parts of a vidio on YouTube for their ads. The uploader did not give permission, and it's not even the same game. This is a terrible product, and the developers should be ashamed.",
      "Stupid touch app, lets you drag slime over the screen and charges 81$ for access to more slime. My 4 yr old has bought VIP, currently trying to gain a refund. I understand my child should have been watched a little closer, but even that aside, if I had bought this app for that much, it would still prompt a refund since the cost simply is not justified by the product. Will hopefully be able to repost a nice story soon.",
      "I mean I with alot of people on 1 star reviews! This app is horrible you can't play it because you get bored waiting for the X so then you can get of this add wanting you to buy products!Its getting annoying coming on a app that used to be great no adds or anything but now its just ruined! I hope nobody bought that add because its a waste! Whoever made this should be ashamed!",
      "Never got around to playing as the fact it's subscription-based put me off. Three days of free trial followed no free option but an immediate £49.49, whatever it was, is ridiculous considering the potential nothingness of this game. *edit - apparently there IS a free option, however the developers have designed this (very sneakily) so that it takes a long time for the X to close down the subscribe option (according to some reviews at least).",
      "lmao its funny how you dont even get do try it. it doesnt even deserve a 1 star, there should be none. its really funny tbh. if it were to have like, 5 options, then it would have been way better, but unfortunately, there is nothing. i expected less anyways. it looked, like not sketchy but kinda. disappointed, but defs not surprised."

      "Impossible to watch past streams of anyone due to the buffering speeds. I'll get 5-6 seconds of footage and then roughly 15-20 seconds of load times. (Not an exaggeration, I timed it with a stopwatch.) This is with average internet speeds in my home of 10-20 Mbps. Not blistering, but Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, et al can stream at 1080 with no latency with roughly 5 Mbps or less IIRC. Please fix this.",
      "Everything runs smoothly for me. No crashes at all. If my internet acts up, obviously there's going to be a small time of buffering. Only thing I would love if they added is a ten second rewind or forward button when watching past streams. It's so hard trying to skip forward from an intro or to go back to see a gameplay using the scroll bar.",
      "My number 1 entertainment app. One thing i would love to have is to be able to sub via my phone. It is added effort to take out ones laptop or switch on our computers when we are already on mixer on our phones. To be honest i would sub allot more if i had the access on my phone app. Thank you still for all the effort and hard work! This is still an amazing platform and team!!",
      "New update. New UI. New layout. Still broken. Audio only mode stuck in buffering. Can't even follow stream because service is terrible and now I can't hear it either. Chat times out often. Screen freezes often. Streaming to mobile has not been streamlined. It's horrible unless on WiFi.",
      "UX not good enough for when streaming on XB1 🎧. Should make it all much quicker & easier to accompany xboxone streamers. eg. When I'm streaming on xb1, my android mixer app shouldn't ask me if I want to start streaming. It should instead recognise I'm streaming and ask me if I'd like to see my viewers and to message with them etc., or, to share to twitter etc! 😒😝 UPDATE 20th March 2020: still poor UX for above reasons."

      "For a long time, I loved this app, I watched it constantly, and never really had any problems using it. But recently any time I attempt to open the app, I am met with a gray screen and the motor trend logo. Even after leaving my phone open, with motortrend as the only active app for half an hour, it would not change. I have a galaxy s10+, so I seriously doubt it's an issue of my phone being able to load it. Please get on this issue as soon as you can.",
      "MotorTrend is always updating the app. Works flawless all the time no matter if it's wifi or network! Content is always updated and always so much to watch. Worth the money I pay yearly for it. Will always have a subscription for MotorTrend for years to come. Don't hesitate to pay for the subscription it well worth the coin! I use it daily! Thanks MotorTrend!",
      "I think the content is pretty good but the app is not very user friendly when trying to find shows you want to watch. Being able to add your favorite shows to a list would go a long way. The problems are even worse when using the app on my Xbox one. It is a nightmare navigating on there. I have to go into a search option to find shows I want to watch and it has no auto play. So everytime I finish an episode, I have to back out completely, run a search, then find where I left off.",
      "Overall nice app, nice variety. More off road, action, racing, KOH please. Issues: • Randomly won't show if watched or progress after return. • Randomly stops progress band while watching & makes it impossible to pause or go back, no control over program. • App loses streaming connection several times an hour using Chromecast. other apps OK. • Program info on episodes etc often won't load, restarting app needed often. • Need program comments/questions avail on mobile. • Skip << >> needed. S7edge",
      "Finally got it to work. The bad thing is I can only watch one episode at a time of any show before MTOD disconnects itself from Chromecast. If I start a 2nd vid after watching something, it will play for about 10 seconds and then it disconnects itself. So I have to reconnect to Chromecast then start the video again. Guess I need to do it manually between vids so I don't get kicked off every time. Please fix. Been an issue for longer than i remember."

      "Shudder is great- the app not so much. I have a Galaxy S10 and suddenly the \"Featured\" page won't load. I have to search for any movie I want to watch, even if I added it to my list, because I can't view my list. Also buffers a lot, and I frequently have to switch out and back in to the app to make it resume. Desktop site works well. Love Shudder. Frustrated by the app.",
      "This app is terrible. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times and it still won't load/ play the movie. It freezes after several seconds and only the audio will continue. Sometimes not even that. I've tried my Wi-Fi. I've tried my unlimited data on my tablet. Nothing is working. I'm very disappointed. I was looking forward to being a paying member. At this rate, I won't proceed past the trial. Please fix your app.",
      "I saw an add for The Room. It was why I signed up for the free trial. Decent app, no lag or freezing issues. However what video streaming app doesn't support casting these days? If it supported casting to my TV, then I'd give 5 stars and would pay for the subscription I think.",
      "Can't watch on tablet which is pretty awful when the site forces you to download the app in order to stream. As others have mentioned the app doesn't allow you to login (states that your login information is incorrect). Please fix!",
      "Works now. I think it is just the internet keeps turning off every so often. I just keep turning it back on, I can deal i guess, if that's the case, for the time being."

Don't waste ur time signing up for the trial, when it asks you, just press back/return to previous page and watch 2 ads. Ur going to have to whether u pay or not. Unsubscribing now and deleting app",
      "BEWARE!!!! Watch out for billing from this app. I enrolled in a 3 day free trial that was supposed to bill $26.99 if not cancelled. I cancelled the trial within 15-20 minutes because the app didn't work for me. Attached to the trial was a 2nd fee for a 1 year service for $96.99, it was not advertised. PayPal and Google have tried to contact the developer to have this issue resolved. It has been over a month and they still will not respond to correct this issue.",
      "😡😤🤬I downloaded this app on Feb 7, 2020 and for some reason I ended up paying for it twice. $25.99 the monthly charge and then again $103.05 for the yrly charge. Both of which came with a 3 day trial that stated you could cancel by Feb 10,2020 and you wouldn't be charged. I tried the app. 1st the palm reader twice and one other. I decided that I wouldn't get my $ worth so I cancelled them both. They already charged my account $103.05 and refused to refund me. I'm PISSED!!! Thieves!!!",
      "ITS A FRAUD. I bought it for my child's birthday, using the 1 yr package for 100 bux. We tried several different things. When we went to scan our faces and hands, but the app kept closing. So we went to log out, but there was no log out button! We searched for half an hour trying to log out, but there is no way to. Everything else closes when u try to take a scan. So we deleted the app, and tried to get a refund. They said they refused, and there was a problem with my son's brand new i pad mini",
      "I downloaded it because I thought it would be fun to try out but then I subscribed of the 3 day free trial and instead of £27 coming out of the bank £46 came out. So I would advise not getting this app. I have also tryed to refund but it kept going refund declined. What a waste of money."

      "Worst App Ever. (Sony Smart TV) Every time we paused a show, we had to back all the way out, come back in, resume. Then, it stopped working altogether. Had to uninstall app, reinstall it, then do the \"run to the computer, log in, enter the six digit code\" dance. I'll also say that the selection, many which are duplicated on Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+, isn't worth the price. Didn't even finish the free trial. We're done with it.",
      "Terrible Terrible Terrible I mean for $5.99 there's a lot more value out there I will be cancelling I've truly given this app an honest shot as I do like some of your entertainment offerings but can't deal with the constant buffering freezing casting issues from my Brand new Samsung Galaxy S 10 C'mon guys get it together heard it was better but couldn't try trial again and so I paid will not pay again till I know for sure. Thanks Rip off Rip off Rip off Rip off Rip off",
      "Absolutely horrible selection of tv shows and movies, it's asinine that they want money for such a horrible app. There's several free apps that have a much better selection of tv and movies.",
      "I've never used this app I have been trying to cancel my subscription since the first month you charged me bout a year please tell me how to uninstall before bill is due again...very unhappy with this... and guess it's okay if you like old movies...but I do not thank you...",
      "I don't understand. Why can I not watch Epix on my computer? I was really excited to start Deep State, but I can only run Epix on my phone. I'm very disappointed. I don't want to pay money to have to watch what I want on a 3 inch screen."

It expects me to subscribe again! I don't think so! We've got a yearly subscription that we cannot access. I have 2 Special Needs kids & they love Boomerang. Please fix this!",
      "I dont like that every episode is not available for some shows. I wish the airdates or years were listed. Dont like how things are grouped and separated, looney tunes especially. Sucks how every characrer is separate. You should be able to decided how things are listed by genre, series or year. You should be able to make your own playlists to rectify this. Sad to see the garfield intro remastered, it looks awful. The app is good, but could use these improvements.",
      "It's not playing on my android. Keeps giving me an error message. I've paid for the yearly subscription and have for 3 years happily but suddenly it won't play. Either fix it or i would like the time that i haven't been able to access it refunded!",
      "Cartoons are not as they were intended in all the thought out plots of each sketch behind it is Great fighting evil and evil always loses in the end,even as in todays westerns of old,modern world crimes & evilness which many directors & producers dwell on and visually promote. It gets old and very boring when those who worship evil and all it's roots are chronically decieved by it's destructive ways leading only to those Who worship it.Sad when you cannot get away from something you cannot!",
      "Just downloaded this app and signed up for the service and so far I am really loving what I'm seeing! Everything is nice and attractive to the eye and the selection of cartoons to watch is practically endless. For 4.99 monthly you can't really go wrong!! HOWEVER! I did run into an issue that I thought would go away. I boot up the app and the \"Home\" never loads, no matter how many times I press the \"Try again\" button. Can this be fixed? I use a Galaxy S8 by the way."

      "Love Plex! I've set it up for myself and others. Bought the lifetime access. I wish they would bring back being able to pull the video from a cloud service like Google Drive or Dropbox. Otherwise, works great and rarely have any issues. Able to access my library wherever I have a good connection. Looking forward to more great things coming from Plex.",
      "Great app confusing choices in design. Why can't you manually change anything? Why does it all have to be automated meaning you have to learn how it thinks first in order for it to automate corrdctly? I don't know. Seems needlessly complicated however once you figure it out it's a really cool system overall. I'm worried at some point I will have more issues but for the time being I've figured out most of the quirks so this app is really cool right now.",
      "If I had dollar for every minute I'd spent troubleshooting Plex over the course of the years trying to get it to work, I'd have enough to build my own app to replace this stunningly unreliable application. As mentioned in other reviews, it's a lottery as to whether updates break or fix problems, and break something else. Please stop releasing junk on to people.",
      "Very easy setup. Very easy to navigate and I wish I would have taken this leap earlier. I can seamlessly watch videos, shows, listen to podcasts and music on all my devices with no effort in worrying about formats for each platform. I have a roku TV, couple fire sticks, windows laptop, ubuntu laptop, Xbox and iPhone on my network. All content works on all devices. Great product!",
      "I played with Plex since it was recommended by friends after i got a TV with built in Roku. Works great for me. Easy to set up my library even though i had to rename hundreds of movies. I like it, works for me, no issues encountered. The metadata can use some work. Movies and show with names same as older shows will show incorrect metadata at times."

    "comments":[
      "I may stick with Quidd since the rewards, and drop rates are better. Drop rates for non-teir items should be a lot higher with how few cards of certain sets you get.It should not be so aimed at diamond spending just to try to collect cards that aren't likely to drop. That'll quickly get me not to purchase. Everyone's complaint is about the same, and never addressed. Trade system is great, but players can be greedy. Rewards are too limited. The application is very laggy, and freezes up a lot.",
      "Otherwise a good game, except the ratio of cards in the packs are completely unreal, especially with those events that doesnt give out 15000 coin guaranteed cards, it's very frustrating and maddening when you open up about 50 1:10 packs and do not get any! I noticed that the admins have not responded to this issue brought up by other users. Same issue, getting worse!",
      "I would rate it higher if I didn't have to constantly restart the app. Sometimes collecting prizes sends it into a loading loop. And sometimes collecting cards does it in the work shop. It is so frustrating! Also I wish in the workshop you could just make cards all at once instead of just one at a time. Maybe a pack or just a constant collect. Something especially with how bad it lags",
      "Opening this app is a nightmare. If it manages to load correctly, i get kicked out by error messages telling me that its having trouble pulling up my profile. I would file a conplaint within the app but I cant open anything without it crashing. I genuinely want to play the app, but its been like this since i first started using it and Im tired of it. Excessive loading is one thing, but loading forever only to not do anything and kick me out is too much.",
      "App is so adictive.but there needs to be a easier way to find cards u need should be like a auction area where you can place the cards you want to trade on the list and people can cross-reference with the cards they're looking for I know they say the wish list and supposed to do that but it doesn't this would be easier you would type in the name of the card and see what somebody wants for it and then you could offer it to them I think that would make things easier to obtain certain cards"

    "recentChanges":"The Star Wars Card Trader team has been hard at work improving, fixing and laying the groundwork for future development.<br>What&#39;s in version 10.5.0:<br>- Added a search bar for workbench to easily find the salvage you need.<br>- New functionality to communicate Maintenance Modes and Forced Update to users.<br>- Fixed an issue where the sound would play during Lock-On even with sound off.",
    "comments":[
      "Lost All My Cards. When I got a new phone and installed the app, I logged in with Facebook as before and my previous user name. All my cards were gone and I was reset back to the beginning. Customer service kept blaming the issue on me and refused to even continue to try to help me sort it out three days ago. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! I had many cards, not sure I want to take time to rebuild now.",
      "NEW UPDATE: I thought the app couldn't get worse- I was extremely wrong. Limited credit packs got rarer, expecting you to pay real money to get, for stupid designs. Previous Version: WORST APP EVER! Trying to get a limited credit pack - pressed to get it 10+ times for a signature - NONE went through and now I've missed the opportunity TWICE! Hate this App! No Notifications, No Botch Fix! I'm also not getting cards I PAID for. This is feeling like a scam. Previous Version: I'm not getting awards",
      "Is funny to collect card and make trades but almost all the collections has the only option to pay. People are selling cards on ebay because of this. It's crazy. Sometimes it freeze when i want to open a salvation or the trading screen will select random cards when you are scrolling down. There are collections more interesting than others but I like it",
      "The app is wonderful since 2016 I recently decided to reinstall and omg is it fantastic! and active community and a sense of collection and value with each card all contain bac covers and a bunch of information. Beautiful UI as well highly recommended for all star wars fans",
      "I purchased Crystal's so I could grab some of the more rare cards. App crashes, takes my credits, cards and Crystal's. The credits you get for free, I cannot be upset about those. But having the app STEAL something I paid for is wrong. I contacted their help/support with the issue and never heard back. Do yourself a favor, dont ever spend a penny."

      "Good quality of replays. However, doesn't let me comment using chat. Doesn't let me mobile stream on my tablet. When I try to find my stream ID with my browser, I am redirected back to the app. Huh? OK, now I am allowed to chat but still there is no camera icon beside my avatar. Is there no one in your support area who cares enough to answer this query? Is it my tablet settings? Anybody there? Hello!",
      "Ok, this is quite a nice platform, the mobile app needs a lot of work though, it's very glitchy and I cant figure out how to tweak my channel at all. Edit: Also, it wont let you make a secure password, I should be able to use any symbols in my password, but not with DLive. Edit: I have to remove some stars because #1 Can't just stream my camera. #2 You have to use sketchy stream labs that wants total access to whatever account you are using #3 have to bend over backwards to make it work.",
      "Can't post a comment, I just downloaded your app and while trying to post a comment on live stream, it keeps telling me to verify my email, I've done it multiple times and it still won't work, I uninstalled the app and downloaded it again, still to see if it'll work now",
      "Buggy but still very decent for a free app. Edit: App is alot better now. The bugs i was experiencing with goin fullscreen, are no longer an issue. What was looked at as just an alternative to other streaming platforms is becoming a competitor IMHO. Kudos",
      "It was good, but I can't login for some reason, whenever I try to login with my email, it says authentication error. Also, forgot password doesn't help at all, it says password wasn't made with this account or something."

We start watching show then it starts threading and won't clear. I have exhausted all technical things to clear, hasn't been successful. Please fix this, you'll end up losing customers if this doesn't get resolved. Oh by the way, I have Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ for my family, I'm able to view all of these without issue. Thanks for reading!",
      "I love Up Faith & Family !! Good, holsom, Christian movies that pull your heart strings and touch your soul. I love it. Because of the computer's firewall and what not, it does lag at times but I have it on my phone and there is no lag at all when I cast it to the TV. Again, I just love it!!",
      "I love it i just wish that it had a way of allowing multiple people to watch it without it messing with the other persons show like if 2 peaple watch the same show it will show one persons part will show up but not the others so i just wish you could have 2 accounts similar to Netflix",
      "So this app has error messages about a week after paying... still cant play any videos. Guess it's time to give up... its the een at least 2 months, probably longer",

      "I know you're working on adding more content so I going to not going to hold that against VET Tv just yet however I would suggest only subscribing one month at a time until they actually have more content than you can watch in one month. Other than that it an awesome concept. Their shows are funny, relatable, and have the potential grow and expand enough to not only have a good citcom series run but also have possible spin-offs shows as well.",
      "Some seriously funny stuff if you're a military person! All the shows are amazing! The app itself could be a little more user friendly maybe an auto play feature so that it runs straight into the next app instead of having to look for an episode each time.",
      "Guys I love it! Haha. I haven't found anything I didn't laugh my ass off about. Majority of my friends have served as well as family. Even my 87 year old uncle was laughing at grunts life. Nothing like this has ever been done nor can it ever be done better. Thank all of you for not just what you've endured, what you have sacrificed, what you have overcame but for helping every single person, veteran and civilian, with whatever struggles they have. You're all ace's.",
      "As a civilian this is a great experience for me, and I'm sure as veterans it's an even better experience when you can connect with what they're saying and laugh even harder at what normal civilians consider offensive. To me none of this is offensive and it's a great comedy channel that has no match, it's better than even Comedy Central",
      "Funny stuff. Reminds me of so many situations in the Corps. Spot on with the language, terms and the reality of what happens in Garrison and deployment life when there's \"down time\"."

      "Signing up for \"CBS All Access\" also signed me up for \"CBS Full Episodes\" without my consent! This results in a double credit card charge every month. Check your credit card statements! Absolutely terrible app anyway, full of alpha-level bugs.",
      "This app works well, for the most part, on my SHIELD TV Pro (recently updated to 8.1.1) and 1080p TV. It works better than the Roku and regular Android versions, perhaps because my SHIELD has a hard-wired Ethernet connection to the router whereas my other devices stream via Wi-Fi. The audio, picture quality, and stability are all good. The only problems I've experienced are out-of-synch audio and video on a few episodes of older shows (specifically Frasier).",
      "I tried watching PICARD but it was impossible to understand. Lots of gaps in the audio and stuttering. Screen freezes and the large pause symbol displays, then the program starts again and the same thing happens over and over. And the background audio is much too loud making it difficult to hear the dialogue. And when there is an action sequence with no dialogue the audio volume goes way up. I have to constantly increase and decrease the volume control. I even had Spectrum come out to check all my connections and signal strength. All in all, this whole thing sucks. And there was no Closed Captioning !!!!!",
      "Ever since the last update there is constant skipping and buffering. It's not worth paying for this low quality video/audio. I'm canceling at the end of the month.",
      "Oof! I subscribed just to see Picard, and it was the absolute worst streaming app experience on my Nvidia Shield. I chose the \"limited commercials\" option, which is a joke. Not only are there lots of commercials, they hang, rebuffer, loading logo, require a restart, and so on. Worth mentioning that I am on gigabit fiber, and have zero problems with the other major streaming apps. The frustration of messing with this poorly designed app really took away from enjoying the program. Hopefully, it'll show up eventually on some other platform, because I am out."

      "I haven't seen a lot of these shows, so the content is decent for me. Since there isn't a ton of variety or new content on a regular basis, I'll probably cancel in 1-3 months time. The App itself is terrible. Constantly glitches, does not support Chromecast as it claims, can't use it simultaneously with other apps, and continuously rejects my username and password even though it's right. Overall, disappointed. It could have had a lot of potential",
      "Love the content but considering unsubscribing in search for a more reliable service. As others mentioned, the app just stops working (you get a grey screen or a loading screen) from time to time. This happened on Feb 5th, when it did not work for a day, and today again. I don't use it every day, so it is possible it doesn't work more often than just a few days a month. No response or apologies/refunds from developers. Please fix this.",
      "Having the same problems I have been reading about on here. Won't replay a show if I want to watch again. Now it won't play an episode I haven't watched. Please fix. I have reinstalled and signed out and back in. Thanks. Was working for awhile but as of 11/20 or so it started not letting me rewatch a show or continue on to the next episode of a series I'm watching. Please fix Thanks ps I'm using my Mobile phone. Hello. The app has been great. But has 3/17 it won't load just broken circle.",
      "I like the shows, but... I can't log in to watch them anymore. It says my password is invalid. I changed my password, twice, to try and fix it. Still can't log in. Tried to delete the app and download again. Still can't log in. Tried to turn off my tablet and turn it back on again. Any guesses? Yep, still can't log in.",
      "The app is ok but the service is not. There is no way to rate them separately so I'm going to review the service since it costs money. The service is relatively cheap, currently $7/mo less 2 months if you pay for a year at a time. They do have a lot of the old BBC shows but they fall short on several of the newer shows. For example, I really like the \"new\" doctor who that started running in 2005 to now. They have NONE of those seasons available. For me this is a deal breaker."

As for the rest...you snooze, you lose, I'm sorry to say! Super easy to navigate,awesome UI, and most of all great fun, and a good laugh! Thank you for many memorable years JibJab!",
      "It's generally a fun app to use. Songs were shorter than I remembered from years ago. Down side: it takes the last face you've used for the previews of all the videos that you see when you open the app. Some videos, though comical, are also sexual, and it was uncomfortable to see \"myself\" doing inappropriate things on videos, or worse yet, my kids, or my Mom. Couldn't see way to opt out of having those videos previewed when I opened the app, so I deleted it.",
      "its a cool app. i like it! it's silly and fun especially when you add people and them send it to them. It puts me in a better mood when I'm down or just in a bad mood",
      "Fun app! Easy to set up and use. The free subscription is good but monthly sub is much better because you can get full videos.",

I dont know if it's just me or my wifi, but the video will stop and tell me that there was a problem. Usually I have to go uninstall it and re install it, please fix this.",
      "The content is golden, the app is lead. When I'm casting, I might as well wait a week and just do it from YouTube because the quality would be better. The fact that I also have to skip forward or backwards by 30 seconds as opposed to YouTube's 10 seconds is a very odd choice. Also, Low/Medium/High for video quality means nothing if there is not a number attached. Needs work.",
      "I just downloaded the entire series of Red Vs Blue to watch while at work (also to avoid using mobile data) and NONE of the videos are playing. At all. I press play and after 5 seconds it says \"Something went wrong. Try again\". All of the videos were downloaded (over wifi) onto my phone's SD card. I have numerous shows downloaded from Netflix and they play perfectly fine, no buffering or data connection needed. So what is the issue here?!? Soo frustrating.",

      "Upon opening the app, it tries to trick customers into opting into either a paid trial, or a free trial that automatically charges a fee at the end of 3 days. There is a hidden x at the top left, but I'd recommend ignoring the x, and just uninstalling the app. Don't allow companies to get away with these shady tactics.",
      "Pathetic app. Just make it a pay version because your free version was probably the worst experience I've had using ANY app of any kind. So many pop ups, redirects, and ads. All the songs are crappy synth knock offs. If you want someone to buy your product, you must provide some value. I'm deleting this app with less than 2 minutes of use. I had to literally turn off my phone to keep it from playing. And I HATE music that plays without controls. Complete trash.",
      "This app was great, because it is not just a ringtone app it also has wallpapers, the only thing is there are a lot of advertisements in the app 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔. but there actually some really good and cool Pop, rock, \"top hits\" and \"recommended\" which actually it's not that bad it also has Billie Eillish there, not that's a big deal or anything but she is there so all of you big or small fans put there, there is no time to die, bad guy and etc",
      "Instead of paying in a year $155.99,. Why not $13per month. I mean damn! would be cool for a selection. Plus didnt say how much per YEAR or MONTH!! Cause just got nice bill in front of my face just few mins ago. & dont say,... im sorry to hear, if have anyother problems please contact ... .... .......... . .... monthly bill would be nicer, instead a baseball bat to the face!! Last & final year im gonna us it.",
      "I loved using this app for bike rides and chilling out but it wont let me download any songs no matter how many tracks i deleted or how many times i reinstall it. Won't be using it till an update unfortunately. 😔🙄"

      "*edit to add* read the responses to other complaints. It is a cookie cutter response that doesn't have anything to do with the issues. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS APP!! My card just got charged and I can't even get into the app to watch anything. It keeps telling me network difficulties. I don't even know how I can get a refund and cancel my subscription. I am not going to pay for something I can't watch. Charged me after I asked them to cancel.",
      "Very poor service. I am having continuous problems. It keeps telling me I have too many devices logged in and I am only using it on 1 tv. It makes no sense. I have edited this review on 3/20/20. They did not help me at all by email. I emailed them at the time I started having problems and I replied with the information they requested. The only way I got the problem solved was by actually calling the help line. You will be on hold for awhile but since I called I have not had anymore problems!",
      "This app is great when it works. I'm paying for a subscription and I can't even watch anything. Everytime I log in and then go to play a movie it logs me out and takes me back to the login screen. I've tried force stop and restart, uninstall and restart and it still does it. Please help. I'm very frustrated.",
      "The movies and shows are the expected fare, though there are a couple of titles that are older Pixl shows I'm surprised not to find here. My biggest issue is that the app randomly kicks me off without warning and asks me to sign in all over again. A secondary issue is that app itself is a little clunky.",
      "This app stops working constantly! I'll come back in to finish a movie and it will be \"unavailable at this time\". 3/11 still not working properly, crashes a lot. I even try uninstalling the app and reinstalling it and then it tells me I have too many devices. I haven't added devices, I'm just trying to get the app to work. This is especially disappointing when you pay $70+ a year for an app to work and it doesn't."

The free trial is only good for one week wast of money if you ask me. There are no adds. I only recommend this app if you like a terrible app and unfair deals. If you download this app your not going to be having a good time unless you spend $69.00 plus tax.",
      "Worst app ever first of all the app picks a story for you. After it picks that story for you you can't look at the pictures, go to the next chapter, or read a different one. You have to have a membership that is $69.99 per year. How dumb do you have to be to pay that much for fake texts when there is something on snapchat that does the same thing for free. Would rate it zero stars if I could.",
      "It only let's you read one episode and then you have to pay for the rest. This app is a waste of time, I think the story's could be good but not worth the money. I hope they can fix this otherwise no one will download this app. Do not download this app, in my opinion it's really not worth it.",
      "The reason why i gave two stars is because the app was really fun while the free trial was going on but as soon as i cancled because im not paying 70$ for a stupid game it didnt work at all not worth the trouble of installing and uninstalling why have a 'free' app if its not really free",
      "I HATE IT no wonder this app has bad ratings you cant even finish the whole season it's so BAD I absolutely hate it.. sooo let me get this straight you clearly want money and dont care about us!?!?!?! 1 STAR and if there was a rating that you had the choice to pick no stars THAT WOULD BE YOU STUPID \"YARN\" I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT"

      "I used to like this game a good bit until I really got into it. Now I realize how money based this game is. I can save coins and use them to open a featured pack. However I barley get anything, espicially compared to people who buy diamonds. I always thought it was a good game and wondered why I kept seeing the same people in chat. They have all been there since day one. Well now I know they spend hundreds of dollars on packs to open and I am using the coins I have saved. Don't pay Don't go far",
      "So far, I'm sitting at a 3 star rating. The interface and animation are well executed. The aesthetic of the cards are good as well. While microtransactions can be a negative, that's just the state of games these days so the app is par the course on that front. My initial gripe, however, is that I immediately watched 5 videos with promise of 250 coins upon completion and didn't receive them. This is a prominent feature of f2p and while I'd like to continue, I need a way to acquire resources.",
      "I've been supporting this app on and off since the first day it came out years ago. As many people will say, it was very good in the beginning years. When they introduced diamonds, you started to tell who is paying for the cards and who actually is trying to collect them and obtain the rare cards through trades. Putting aside the microtransactions, my only major gripe is that it constantly crashes on older devices (ex: Amazon Fire Tablet) whenever you try to purchase a pack.",
      "I like this game but I wish they would update when you sign in instead of saying 19 it supposed to be 20 and also to be able to get some good cards instead of having to pay cash to buy diamonds wish I would give it some the good ones to people who can't afford to buy diamonds that's why I didn't give it a five star rating is there some things that it could improve on",
      "I would have given this app 5 stars. It is very addicting and the community is very helpful. But it's not fair for people who don't spend money. When new promos come out the people who don't spend money have a slim chance at getting good cards to trade and better there collection. I believe you could definately make this app better if you helped the non money spenders to get better cards than just base cards."

      "I really enjoy recolor and it's the best app I've used, the only down fall is the cost now to use all the colors and pictures.. I can't afford to subscribe at almost $15.00 a month and I would love to be able to enjoy the whole app.. It would be great to take our minds off this event and all the craziness going on, but yes it's a great app if you like coloring and there are some real artists on here...🤗🎨",
      "This game is definitly amazing, I would recomend trying it! My only dislike about Recolor is that, you have to be premium to do a lot of things, you have to be premium for certain pictures, types of effects, and colors. It would be better if yoy brought down the lack of premium things! Other than that, Recolor is a perfect app for when you are bored, and when you dont really feel like doing anything XD. Recolor is a must download.",
      "Love love love Recolor. My mother has been using for years and got me hooked around summer 2019. The pictures are beautiful the colors are vivid the tools easy to use. And thats not all, the community of artist is amazing, everyone supporting each other no matter the skill level. Anyone can enjoy this app. I love the flexiablity of starting and stopping my art project anytime, without the worry of clean up. But all this does come with a price, extra colors cost and the app crashes now and again.",
      "The pictures are really amazing and the coloring itself is really satisfying! Unfortunately in order to color the free pictures you have to watch an ad? I understand as a business you need to get money but when it starts to become your entire app something needs to change. I appreciate the app itself good job on that! I honestly wouldn't mind a couple ads but all of the free pictures having ads? Anyway thank yall for responding to other user's comments! I'm definitley open to corrections!",
      "Love this app but recently it's started deleting my progress. Normally I'll color a little on a piece and step away for a while, closing the app out to save battery, then come back later to finish my work. But now, sometimes, when I open a half-colored picture back up, it's suddenly blank, as if I've done nothing to it. So that's not cool, as well as the allowance of images clearly not colored in the app by some users, but other than that I like it. Great variety of pictures."

      "I've just started and have completed my first two pictures. The art work is excellent. The colouring in is helped by the number you are working being highlighted in the picture. It also shows if you have finished all the spaces needing that colour with a circle completing itself around that number. My kids love it too. You can also enlarge to help get the tiny areas. Definitely recommend it to everyone.",
      "I really enjoy this game lots and lots because I like art and this game is really something that gives you another point of art instead of just going and have to go into the store and buy paper and colors and all of that you can just sit here get your iPad or your computer or your phone out and just tap on these little color item things to color and is really fun and nice enjoyable and when you get done with all of them you can go back and look at them and say oh my gosh I have did all",
      "I absolutely love this game, but it keeps glitching on me. I have almost 2,000 pictures colored (I've had the game for a while) and almost all of the things completed that give free hints. Then the game will glitch and it won't load the pictures that I've colored and it completely erases all of the things I completed so that I have to start them all over. I delete and redownload the game and everything will work fine for a few days then glitch again and I have to delete/redownload all over again",
      "Much improved and now very enjoyable. Suggestion: water mark on images needs to be smaller or eliminated. 6.27.2017 update This is the best \"paint by number' app I've use. Developer is constantly adding new content. Highly Recommend! I'm not associated with the developer and my opinion is my own. 03/20/2020 Use this app everyday. The developers continue to improve and add new picts. FB links give you option of obtaining new content. Developer ask for input from users and make changes, addition.",
      "I do like the pictures, it would be a really really good app if it weren't for all the ads. I hate how you have to watch a ad before and after a picture, I do like that most of them are skippable. My app also has a glitch, when I finish a color it doesn't highlight the new color. Normally it fixes itself quickly but sometimes I have to find the color before it will highlight itself."

      "Pretty fun and good for passing time. Would like to see more frequent new pictures but nothing to take me off enjoying it. This is by far the best pixel colouring app I've seen and I don't think any will beat it. Maybe there could be something to help people that aren't good at creating pixel art get better that'd be cool.",
      "It is super sad that you cannot move the colours one by one... Used to be able to and then it was changed and it is super restricting. If colours 5 and 6 are next to each other in the picture you cannot use them both without first adjusting. I like the game but hate it when freedom to colour is restricted.",
      "I like the Sandbox x alot.ecan you put in more patterns ?Please ???The game makes the phone jump around. It's supposed to jump to where the major parts of the number that you are using is located.But it just keeps jumping around.it has also been freezing up.Alot",
      "I love this app because whenever I get bored during class or something I can sit on it and girl well color the desert little area where you can color whatever you want and you can take pictures off of your gallery and color them that's pretty cool too",
      "Good actual colouring. I like that you can have your drawings as live wallpaper and just double tap to fill if you don't feel like colouring it all in (but it doesn't look very good on the animation of colouring it in). However, most of the images are Sandbox Unlimited, which means you pay a subscription for them. No ads, which is good, but I would prefer some ads, more free images and a one-time payment than loads of Unlimited images and a subscription fee. There are better colouring apps."

      "Absolutely terrible. Has great difficulty with casting, \"resume\" play randomly doesn't work which means when you try to find your place every fast forward triggers a two minute commercial break (of the same 2 commercials on repeat), only to have the app randomly start playing a different show or the spoiler filled recap of the episode on trying to watch. I pay for AMC, but piracy is the only way I can actually watch the shows.",
      "Constantly logs out and the UI is insufferable. I tried using this app but it's absolutely horrid. The interface doesn't allow you to save any show you're watching or has an easy to use library. After I find the show I want to watch it logs me out if the app I've paid for after every episode. The app on the Xbox suffers from the same UI but so far hasn't logged me out.",
      "Crashes constantly. always has issues casting. Seems the only thing that keeps a solid connection is the commercials that will loop over and over and over again while the shows disconnect and freeze. Sometimes the show doesn't load at all and commercials will continue to play... I hope they can fix this app because it's a joke",
      "App is complete trash. Never stays signed in. Plays tons of ads even though you pay. Always says playback error check connection. I have 200mbps internet. The connection isn't the problem. Can't watch anything on mobile data, just buffers . Also the UI for the app is terrible. I need Google maps just to navigate it. AMC makes good TV shows. They don't know how to make an app. Tubi and Crackle are better and more stable as far as the apps concerned and they are free .",
      "This has to be one of the worst TV apps. I skip a few minutes to get back where I was when the app randomly decides to bring be back to the 2 min mark. Then I have to watch like 3 sets of 2 min ads and hope it decides to work. Also the UI sucks."

      "I purchased this within the first few weeks of launch. Initially I was a Dimension 20 fan and wanted the episodes as it came out. But I found myself quickly immersed in the many shows, skits and funny content offered. For the price it's a banger of a value. I'd definitely recommend getting on board. Not just for the great content but to help this company continue to make amazing things and push the boundaries of what they can offer.",
      "I've been subscribed to Dropout since its release, and I haven't been disappointed with the content at all! I'm especially a fan of Dimension 20 and Game Changer, and I loved Total Forgiveness! The only thing I could think to improve would be the closed captions. I mostly watch with the Roku app (not sure how it's different from this version) and the captions are often wrong to the point where someone with no hearing might not be able to follow along.",
      "Love the content. Well worth the subscription price. The app could do with a few features. I would love to be able to download content both as audio (for podcasts) and video for access during travel and would like an autoplay function. hopefully these are coming soon! Edit: star rating updated with new version. Literally no complaints and my favorite streaming service.",
      "The app works very poorly. It remembers where you left off, but won't actually start you there, so you have to remember yourself. It also has no Bluetooth compatability, meaning that you can't pause or play from your headphones. For a video-streaming app, it doesn't do a lot of the things you would hope for.",
      "Somewhat surprisingly worth the money. Almost all of the new content is fantastic, and clearly they're putting the money in creative directions. Curated lists through the back catalog are helpful for getting to hidden gems that have accumulated over the years. UI was buggy at first, but improvements were made over time and now it's functional and pleasant to use."

      "Downloaded the app to stream content to my smart TV. However, I can't even log in... Always get \"Something went wrong. Try again.\" or \"Cannot connect to server. Check your internet connection.\" That's funny. None of my other streaming services have issues. And I get the same error when I'm on LTE and WiFi. Will definitely be canceling after the free trial. I don't want to watch all of these on just my laptop and it's not worth the Hassel of constantly hooking my laptop up to my TV.",
      "What is going on? This is such a poorly rated app for offering something so amazing...I am so disappointed, especially at a critical time where it is being advertised to be used at home when people cannot go out. I am not able connect to my Chromecast from my Android device through the app. Really huge let down, maybe you should stop advertising your service if it's been an ongoing issue. Really big let down.",
      "DOES NOT WORK!!! I downloaded the app last night, it worked fine, great even. Although I wish I could put transfer it to my tv. Anyways, I tried finishing Cats and it keeps kicking me off, stating connecting error. I am on a 4G network...I am using my data. I have tried switching to my home wifi, still states the same thing 😞 Disappointed!",
      "Don't waste your time with a subscription unless you watch on your internet device. The mobile app has no native Chromecasting. Google chrome on a laptop with the casting addin, the video was poor quality and stuttered constantly, completely unwatchable. Other items watched via browser on TV are flawless. I didn't even bother to check and see if the internet devices displayed decent images and playback, I want to cast to my TV.",
      "Everytime I try to log into my account it says \"something went wrong\" yet it works perfectly fine on my computer. Also I am unable to watch BroadwayHd on my tv through internet service. I Google and go on broadwayhd website and it says platform doesnt support it when I try and watch. So in conclusion app wont let me log in and my firestick doesnt support this"

      "This is one of the better coloring apps I've tried, and I've tried many apps. I would give it 5 stars if more free pics were available to color. Thanks! The following question is totally unrelated to my review of this app: I was wondering if anyone knows \"What's Up\" with the \"Tell us more (Optional)\" questions after the review? They should be taken down... they're ridiculous, they don't make no sense, and are very annoying!",
      "I bought a premium membership, and the app advertises other types of coloring page collections that are only available with a paid subscription; however, when I tried to access these collections, I was promoted to pay ANOTHER lifetime subscription or monthly fee. Seriously?!! Aside from that, the coloring pages I can access are beautiful and edgy! So far, I enjoy the relaxation of coloring while listening to meditative music.",
      "Love the pictures and the colors. The colors aren't just flat colors there's shading and patterns involved. I love how cheap the monthly premium is and the lifetime one is a great deal as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars (really I'd give it 4.5) and not 5 is that you still have to pay to unlock story missions (though at a discount) even though you have a premium membership.",
      "Generally liked the game at first, liked the comicbook-like feature (which I had not seen in any other coloring app) but am uninstalling and giving a low rating because after i has colored the 1st 6-or-so pics of the story i was asked to pay $6.99 to continue. This app is more expensive and costs a very high price to unlocked very limited features. I have tried many coloring apos and DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE.",
      "I love this game very much but I need more to color cuz I have colored them all. I want to renew my subscription next month but do to nothing more to color but the daily ones I'm sad to say I won't be renewing my subscription. Sorry & this was the only coloring book I will ever download."

      "Good shows, glitchy app. \"Sorry, we are unable to load this stream.\" I get that a lot. I love these shows when the app actually works. It's not my wifi or phone. Because everything else on my phone works. And sometimes it just randomly loses connection. Disappointing. Acorn TV does work on my desktop TV, however. Is there. Setting I'm overlooking?",
      "Buffers every 30s secs the last couple of days...so frustrating!!!! I am still on my 7 day trial so can't say if this is normal or not. It never happens with any of my other streaming apps so I know it is not my device. Also it rarely seems to be able to start a show from where it left and doesn't always recognise an episode has been watched.",
      "The Acorn programming is great but the app is very poor. Here are a couple of the problems I have with the app: When casting to my TV I have to start the program on the app then cast it, otherwise the cast attempt fails. The \"recently watched\" section of the app lists the same two shows for months even though I have watched several dozen shows by now. The app doesn't keep track of the episodes that you've watched in a series, so you have to figure out which episode is next every time you watch.",
      "Theifs!!! They will give you a free trial for week, like most things you give them your card information so they can charge you after the free trial. However contrary to following their instructions there's no way to cancel. I tried to cancel on my phone cancel on my computer add to cancel through your fire TV those instructions and it gives you no ability to what does is let you sign out at the top of it. Also they claim that their customer service can't cancel your account for you. Fraud fraud",
      "Not impressed at all. Is there a point to even telling you. I've tried contacting you and apparently not email to you will not send. I cant get anything from the app \"sorry cant stream or load\" is the standard message I get. If I cant access so.ething I'm paying you for then what is the point. This nonsense has happened before. I get no help, no way of contacting you. Not even sure u will get this either. So basically I'm paying \"acorn\" for absolutely nothing."

      "Great app just like the others. Only a couple of navigation issues like swiping is a bit unresponsive in the store. Also you should make it so that when you open a pack the menu goes back to the last pack you opened. Very inconvenient to keep having to scroll down to the same pack 20 times. Other than that beautiful work as usual. Love collecting things and this scratches that itch",
      "So slow and unresponsive. I've turned the effects off and that doesn't even change anything regarding the performance. This is terrible compared to the performance of the other games.",
      "For a game that is based off a franchise that started off as a comic book series, it's really disappointing to see that this is just from the two shows. I've never watched the series and I have zero intention to do so. I give this one three stars simply because I know there's people out there who love this show (and thus this game), I'm just disappointed that Topps clearly has no rights nor interest of having actual art in this series.",
      "I can't get past the option to learn about the \"new features\" on the opening screen. Neither the 'No, thanks' nor 'Yes, please' buttons respond to being tapped, rendering me trapped inside of the help menu. Removing this interuption or implementing a mandatory tutorial system such as the one in Topps SLAM 19 would both fix this problem and doubtlessly earn you a 5star rating from me. This issue occurs for me on BUNT, STAR WARS, KICK, etc.",
      "Love the app but not to crazy about to the diamonds odds compared to coins odds..i feel people who can't afford to buy diamonds has a chance at all the cards available"

      "I give this 3 stars because of 1 thing. This app takes it upon itself to tell you when you have to \"give your eyes a break\" now that would be fine if the screen went black for 10 seconds or so. But nope, straight to an add. That is not resting your eyes. Other than that it's not a bad app. Enough free pictures to paint and color.",
      "2-28-20 Update: I have a Galaxy S9+ and it just went through a major update and I can no longer download the pictures I color. I have restated my phone and that didn't work. Can you fix on your end? ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COLORING APP!!!!! THE PICTURES ARE PHENOMENAL!!! One request would be dragons and I would be in heaven!!! I tried the other coloring apps and they don't have the amazing colors and don't compare to Paint Color. This is the only coloring app I will use!!!",
      "First off, loved the game play. HOWEVER, when I first downloaded the app, I got an ad every once and a while. I tried the free trial, now I get an ad before and after every picture as well as after 1:50 into the picture, every time, it shows an ad. I was working on one for about 12 minutes and had seen 5 ads. It's one thing before and after but to continuously and very frequently show ads during the picture, ridiculous. I love the functionality but have to delete. Sorry can't do it.",
      "This app is greedy. Not only does it constantly have ads and interrupts you when you're coloring, but it's constantly asking you to buy the premium membership and use microtransactions. But if that's not all, when you click on a free image that has an ad, it says \"No video available\", bit click on an image that doesn't have an ad icon and it immediately plays an ad. I'm done with this.",
      "Love doing most of these pictures, they're pretty, and theres a range for everyone, but omg stop with the ads already.... Before a picture, after a picture, \"rest your eyes\" less than 3 minutes into the picture and every 3 minutes after that.... If i wanted to \"rest my eyes i would put my phone down. Its ok for ads every now and then, or to unlock certain pictures and gain hints, but god dam it i cant hack it.... Sort this out or i will just end up deleting this app...."

I wish it would be better. So bummed.",
      "It was fine. I got the free trial just to watch No One Saw a Thing. It was excellent, for the record. I made this review just to counter all the reviews criticizing it because they said it's hard to cancel. I was concerned going in but was able to cancel with 30 seconds simply by going into my account on the browser instead of the app. Amazon Prime and Audible are both much harder to cancel on. I appreciate the free trial but there's not enough content to make it worth paying for. Good luck!",

      "Horrible app you have right here. I mean what the heck is up with 35 seconds long ads very 10 seconds. How the heck are we supposed to use the app if that keeps happening?! Your platform is also poorly designed for navigation...stupid app doesn't even save faces and I have to start frm scratch again....again, stupid app doesn't even allow me to save my edited videos...What the heck?!!! Rubbish!",
      "I think that starting with the app to lead you to a way to sign into a subscription immediately seems pretty scammy... was able to figure out how to get past the subscription portion, but app doesnt work if you use gallery photo. Bounding box for face changes after you tap save, so app doesnt work and tries to scam you into a subscription before you find out.",
      "What an awful app. Nothing functions properly, im not one to write reviews but this is just too bad. I saw an add and tried cheering up my friend by making a funny video with the app. I opened the app and suprise 30 ad. I closed the ad and as soon as I pressed the photo button more ads the servers take for ever to load anything and was stuck at loading screens for over 10 minutes god forbid I accidentally hit the screen and get more ad spam when I did get the app to work i couldn't even share it",
      "Need to pay in order to actually use the app. It would be a great app if this wasn't the case. Fix this please. Might I also add, what you're doing is false advertising as you don't explicitly say in the description that you need to pay just to have the \"free\" Trial. Thank you devs for wasting my time.",
      "When you go to crop an image of a friend the outlined selfie placement thing moves a little up and to the right after yhe photo has been taken.. very disappointed with that as that is the main feature of this app... why i gave 2 stars was because well 1. That problem and 2. Other than that its an okay app, its a little laggy also.. but for €10.99 a month its definitely not worth it. I hope you can fix this issue, thanks! J."

      "The intro is great but, I doesn't want me to use it, I clicked everything in. My screen to move it away but it still says \"are you sure\" it's forcing me to buy the free trial, wich is sooooooo annoying, I really hate this app, when I saw this on Facebook I was exited downloading this app when I opened it I exitment turned into anger. This app ain't my type",
      "I will be honest. There are a lot of issues with this. Where to start? How about $30 a week? I have had this on my phone for less than an hour. Already it has crashed at least 5 times 3 of those when I chose a new pic. 2 random. Try as hard as you want to get it right but the face always seems to be off. It is slow to render also. I don't like to be be negative on apps people have busted their behinds on. There is a 3 day trial that you can use to decide. Could be a fun app. Has potential.",
      "£39.49 A WEEK? A WEEK!!! IS THIS A JOKE? I didnt even bother trying this app as you have to subscribe with a payment card just to try it out, and was too scared I'd get charged. Probably buy whole software which can do this for the price this is asking a month ...... just stupid ......",
      "First of all, whenever I try to take the picture of someone, it always cuts off half the face. Second, you should be able to take atleast 3 pictures before the limit is up. And third, this is overall just a bad app, bad directions, it makes you stay on the page of getting the free trial for way too long and I think everyone can agree that 29.99$ is way to much to pay for this app.",
      "Dude. Just like, DUDE. So cool app and all, it's easy to use and has a good selection of videos and such but jeez, $30!?! FOR A WEEK. That's a ridiculous price for an editing app. Like I might pay $30 for the whole app, but every week? What a waste."

      "I would give this app 5 stars, if it let me play it more often. Every time I tap on a pic to color, it says there's a network connection error, even though my phone says the connection strength is excellent. Clicking on \"try again\" doesn't doesn't work even tho I try multiple times. Occasionally it will immediately load the pic and I can color one, but not very often. It's a shame, cuz the pics are amazing and it would prolly be my favorite coloring app (I have 7) if it wasn't for this problem.",
      "It's the best game it has alot of options for coloring pictures you can understand Wie it says adult coloring for some of the pictures but I do wish there weren't so much ads It's really relaxing and if I'm mad all I need to do is color a picture and BOOM back to normal I wish I could play this game all day long and if it's a little bit of a glitch like mine was when I first got the game I got rid of it than got the game agne then it was fine I'm satisfied with the game trust me it's the best❤❤",
      "It wont let me open up too many of the pictures. Black square pops up saying some type of error. Also some other photos lets me watch the video to unlock picture then it says network error or bad internet connection try again. Its a guessing game. Ill watch the videos to unlock and nothing so annoying ads to not color the photo i chose. This app has too many bugs and if not fixed i will delete. Thats why i gave 2 starts. To many malfunctions in this app. Though the photos im able to color great",
      "Ok so this is a update on my last review, If you turn on online this app will work amazingly! But if your looking for a offline drawing app this isn't going to work for you! And they say you can download the pictures and use it offline, but I tried that and it still won't work offline.",
      "I'm honestly disappointed. I read another review saying that you hid some of the things and it almost forces you to have to use hints, I thought, \"surely it can't be that bad\" Oh, no, it is. It's terrible. They didn't even try to cover the fact that they do it, there's a hidden one or multiple hidden for almost ever color. It's ridiculous and annoying. The paintings are pretty though, the only good thing I can say."

      "Tried to charge me $145.00 a couple of days after I had a quick look at the app! Apparently they want me to pay it and I never even used it. I only partially subscribed (as was requirement for playing) until they asked my name and then birthdate...which is I quit before giving this (I gave that I was female, and that's about it). So never subscribe or fill out their subscription. They want your details and your money!! SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
      "I have installed this app and opted for free trial.....the next month when my subscription amount was debited from my account I cancelled the subscription as I was not even using the app. Now my money is not been refunded. If has been refunded. It has been 3 days since the cancellation. I hate this app and please refund my money back.",
      "Worst app ever. The very second i open the app it requests card details before i can even try the app. Whats even worse is how they're trying to charge $150.00 EACH MONTH, all for an app I'll probably use once or twice for fun. Please don't waste your hard earned money on this app, it's not worth it.",
      "Godamn scammers, I know it was you that tried to get into my account after I downloaded and immediately unownloaded. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP THEY WILL TRY TO HACK INTO YOUR MICROSOFT IF YOU DO NOT PAY AND TAKE YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS. luckily I don't have any payment methods saved on any device. A word of advice - never make card payments. Buy google play cards/vouchers to purchase apps and games to save yourself a disaster.",
      "I downloaded this app for some fun but it turns out you have to pay MONTHLY for EVERYTHING and although there was an option to watch an add to see results I clicked on it and it said that I had no connection which obviously I do as I am on the internet!"

      "This app is the best! It allows 11+ and it has many different things to do! It's kind of like tik tok but with your own avatar and there are many different worlds and maps and servers to explore! And there are new poses every day/week! And there are crews that you can join,you can even make your own!and there are blind dates! And also a quiz to take for a soulmate for any sexuality! It's fun and I highly recommend it!",
      "Excellent app! Zepeto is absolutely a great game. I never get bored of it. People, please do not listen to the false rumors of this app. Zepeto does not track you! Someone asked why does it need microphone access, it needs it because in the game, you can record videos where you can have your zepetos face on yours, you can talk in the video!! The rumors of this app are absolutely stupid! Dont worry, just get the app, it's fun!",
      "I love zepeto so much because I love socializing . But these days i keep disconnecting from the world. I know my connection is bad but I have no problem going on world without disconnecting before (my network have always been bad). Is this because of my connection or because the server error? I can go on a room that have very least people and when people starts crowding, I straight away got disconnected. Please fix this because I really love zepeto. Thank you.",
      "i think it's a great fun game where you can see other people's worlds and get to socialize with people, but unfortunately i have to give it 3 stars for a few reasons. idk if this is just me but sometimes, whenever i'm trying to go to a world, after the world loads, the screen just freezes and doesn't let me do anything in the game which is kind of annoying, i would appreciate it if you could fix that. overall, good game with just some few bugs.",
      "Amazing!👍💛I can change my character, send messages to my friends, post photos etc, the only problem is that when I try to set a background from MY photos, it bugs and also it takes a long time to load. It's probably my phone but if it isn't it would be nice if you could find a way to fix this. Also could add sending photos on the messages? Thank you so so much for adding my idea, it really makes messaging easier!! If I could do more than 5 stars I would put 1,000,000 stars thank you!!!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

      "Complete waste of time if you plan on using with a Singing Machine Karaoke System because the machine is so cheaply made you wont be able to use it more than once. Plus the price is outrageous $14.99 a month for a very small amount of music and song choices. Save your self the hassle and just look up Karaoke Music on YouTube for free and choose any song you want? You're welcome! Thank you for reading!",
      "Its a quality machine for the price. We are really getting to enjoy it more, now that we are staying home to help flatten the curve. Never a dull moment, it helps us forget about our situation and we can even bluetooth to our tv or any device with bluetooth and sing along with the radio or youtube, its lots of fun and good times. Thank you for allowing us this time to enjoy singing along to more songs.",
      "Honestly, this app is really amazing! I also really love my singing mashine very much!! I tried out the mobile app and let me just say, it's not that bad for a karaoke app! I you guys put all of my favorite songs and artists on the app! I can just sing my heart out and enjoy!!🖤🖤🖤 great app! Keep up the incredible work!! Love Anna-",
      "It is exactly what I was looking karaoke app for a friend's party and spending time together but not for singing competition or showing off. It cast to TV, have lead singer that you can switch on/off, and decent catalogue of songs. As a thought it would be great if there was an option to adjust volume for lead singer.",
      "Awful. I bought this for a Christmas present and started the subscription but it will not display any words to the machine screen or the hdmi out connected to the big screen. Is my daughter's machine broke or do you have to use the phone with the app for the words?"

      "I purchased the full gamehouse series for $9.99 a month which suppose to come with unlimited plays on the games. I play the gamehouse delicious World mostly and instead of there being unlimited plays with the unlimited access subscription it's only giving me 5 hats. I even tried to press the restore purchase that's in the settings but nothing is changing. There was also a time when it did give me unlimited plays for a few days but stopped again. Please fix my issue asap",
      "I love these games. And I totally subscribed to the app but I'm having difficulty playing games on my phone because it says that I have to buy them. I have had them email me a code and then it seems fine but then it boots me back to putting in an email again. I really want to play the games on my phone but I can't because it says I have to subscribe and I'm already a subscriber and I don't want to be paying double. Please Help!",
      "These games are good, well made.. but I don't understand why we have to continuously pay for them? $10.00 monthly for a game is a bit much if you ask me. If I only had to pay one time, than even that would be more understandable. If you have so many fans why make them pay so much!! 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️",
      "This app works great on my tablets and phones (iPad, Samsung galaxy tablets and Samsung galaxy phones). I gave this 5 stars, only downside is that out of all the collectable cards, we earn more than there are items to buy. we should have more clothing/accessory items for our avatars. But in all seriousness, the app hasn't crashed yet (at least of no fault to itself... ie: me crashing it while doing other things that crash other apps when I do it.). I love all the games and their replay value",
      "It's good in a way but It's no point in keeping the membership when you have played all the limited amount of games. Might as well say we bought them all already while waiting on the next to come out."

      "When it actually works, it's great. But then, with no rhyme or reason, it just decides \"secure playback not allowed on this device\" and won't play anything on my cellphone. I don't understand why you'd say you support platforms and then not actually support them. Incredibly annoying. It's not as if this material hasn't already been pirated - so why are you punishing those who are trying to pay to see it? Fix the app.",
      "The Criterion Channel is the only streaming service you need! The quality of the content puts netflix, hulu, prime etc. to shame. My one request is for the home page to show more of its content and to make it easier to browse by genre and decade. They have lots of movies, but they are hidden away so you have to do some experimental searches. I love that you can download the movies to watch while travelling, or if you're like me, to watch in rural America where there is no internet.",
      "The selection here is fantastic. I've watched around 80 movies since I subscribed last year. The only problem I have is how the films are categorized in the interface. When I click on a film, I want all of the extras to pop up with it, not the other films in the same category. I also want to be able to clear my \"Continue Watching\" list.",
      "I think the films are great, but i can no longer watch them. I was able to just fine until yesterday, now every film says \"cannot play video, this device does not support secure video playback\". What a bummer.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, signed out and signed back in. It's stupid annoying.",

Or the ads freeze and you can't watch anything anyways. FIX THIS PLEASE. This app seems to just keep breaking. AFTER AN AD, IT WON'T EVEN SAVE THE PLACE I WAS AT.",

Reinstall doesn't fix connection issues. 5 stars for your website content but this mobile app needs fixing. Its It's annoying not being able to watch on my Samsung tablet."

      "I highly suggest you get the pro version. It is so much better than the ad version. The only time the scanner ever goes down is when the person providing the feed disconnects. It works flawlessly otherwise. I was a beta tester on the other version and decided to get the pro and am very glad I did.",
      "This app adds so much convenience and extra features as opposed to going directly to the Broadcastify website. To me, the differences between the free and Pro version were negligible; but I enjoyed the free version so much that I bought the Pro just to support the developer.",

Whenever the artist got on live, I didn't get any notifications from them having a live video and it hurts me. I really hope you will reply back soon and fix this problem. Thank You",
      "Its good n all, it has improved except when I wanna connect it to my smart tv, it just won't. It just said: \"Temporary error has occured retry\". Back then, when this app haven't updated, I could connect it to my smart tv but the problem was subtitles weren't working on tv. Please fix it.",
      "The app is great but every 11 seconds the video will be buffering and the sign \"loading\" appears. I don't know whether it is because of the app or the broadband, but it sure is annoying",
      "This app crashes my phone almost EVERY time??? I have to manually restart my phone while watching videos on vlive so I miss out on live content 😐 I have a Galaxy Note 9. Can someone please fix this problem before I delete the phone app altogether and just use it on the computer. Also it tends to get really laggy when I try to use the multitasking functions & heats up my phone really fast.",
      "Love the app but it's so frustrating that I don't receive a single notification when an artist goes live, why? I receive the notif on my digital tablet but not my phone, please fix this it is becoming an annoying problem."

It bad experience for me an regretting downloading this app and subscriping.",

Since then i have been trying to login again but is not logging me in . I'm tired for this whole thing, infact im regretting why i subscripted in the first place. My money is going and yet i cant login into my account."

Dick Grayson has always stayed true to what he learned as Robin and his code is simple – if you&#39;re breaking the law on his turf, expect a swift, painful trip to Arkham.  While everyone&#39;s favorite Titan keeps the peace, we continue to improve DC Universe with new features, bug fixes and better performance.",
    "comments":[
      "The content is good however the interface could use some work.  There is only one size for the closed captions and it is way too large for me.  Please allow users to change the size of the captions.  Also, when looking at the episodes for a season there is no indication which ones I've already watched.  Take a look at the Netflix GUI. This is probably the best one in terms of Android TV streaming apps.",
      "Great content but it stopped keeping track of last episodes watched. Very annoying. On nvidia shield.",
      "Cool app but no surround sound keeps this from being a good streaming service.",
      "Comic book feature works great on the big screen.",

      "Will Not Play Video on Chromebook, when you click on the program you want to watch the audio begins to play and the video never comes on. I never had this problem with my phones but it just won't work with the Chromebook. Also, new content is PAINFULLY slow to arrive.

Tried working with support for +30 days to get weak excuses: it's proper to receive something else than what you opened with a 1-of-1 collection; you never received what you opened so that's why it's not in collection; and your coins may take up to 24hrs to arrive after watching an ad. Worst support experience.",

      "This app is good when it comes to choices because there is many choices . But the problem that i encountered is the subtitle . The names of the actors are translated too . The father of the girl named construction and the girl named sound then the enemy of the girl named tube . TH 🤣 Then when the girl talked to the father of boy . The father explained that his son needs to go to other country for his study then suddenly the subtitle is \"do you want to eat?\" Hahahah please fix this ASAP.",
      "Originally I had given this app a 5 star rating cuz it's amazing and has many dramas however today I tried to watch a drama but the screen was black also u can hear the sound but can't see anything. Although I restarted the app, I'm still having the same problem. Please help me fix this issue and I will give 5 stars immediately! (: Edit: Back to 5 stars cuz the problems been fixed!! Thanks!",
      "I love watching Chinese movies these days it's kind of hard to come by but this app lets me watch it without any adds disturbing when I'm watching even though it's not in English I can still read the subtitles and it doesn't have any fizzy glitches or stops on you this is a nice app if you want. If you're interested in Chinese movies it's💋😍👍👍 nice I love it you got to try it",
      "Its very Good perfomance its given me an good mood every day all the movies and series are very good! I love this app! But the sibtitles sometime are gone when theres an Add but when the add gone the subtitle too are gone! Im an Asian person and i cant understand Chinese! Im sorry to give 4 star only because of this but if you fix this i will give 5 star rating because those good series are really nice you need to fix this Bug or situation thank you!",
      "Update: Yeah this is a five star app gone wrong. I cannot project it to my main screen (not everyone has 20/20 vision) in real time. My TV is brand new so no tech issues there. There is a DISTINCT lag in voice and subtitles that was not there before the app update. This update has made this app not accessible to those with vision issues. Ad choice is notorious for lag time on cell phones. Just make us watch the whole ad and you will provide a better experience for your viewers. Fix it please."

Maybe think about the celebrities being able to do an activity or talent or sport...juggling, magic trick, handstand .. Idk needs something more. Also i was unsure on who some of the people are, maybe label their names below their picture. I know i cant be the only one. Please make LADY GAGA, Bea Smith, Eminem, Bruce Lee, Micheal Jordan, Cher.. Thank you.",

But when you go back to one show or the other you can't tell what the last episode you watched was unless you can remember the title of the episode, it's always on the first episode.

      "The update was really horrible.. The older version was so good actually.after singing a song we can't listen whenever we wanted to point it..can't adjust here and there and listen like the previous version. It's like u post it or delete it..the drafts also., we can listen once nd then either post it or delete it. Plz Starmaker team. Fix it.. I'm a huge fan of this app.. Actually brought many users fr this app",
      "New Update is bad(UI). Now we can't select specific time from which we want to hear recording. Not after you finish song not even after saving it in drafts. Please bring it back. It becomes harder to choose right effect, it requires listening particular line over and over again and it's not possible now.",
      "Why is the new update very bad. The system settings like volume, effects, sound speed are not getting fixed..We cannot scroll the song backward or forward to listen a line again while adjusting..After posting songs which were pre adjusted for effect, volume, song speed etc, all the settings gets changed and song is heard with different way...why is all these happening.... This began after the latest updation was done... Need a real solution ASAP..please...",
      "Another bad update from starmaker team. I don't know how people think there when designing and tweaking the UI again and again. 1.Its tough to find who is your collab partner, 2.After recording a song you just can't skip or pause the recorded track 3.Room singing sync problem after the update Hoping for a quick fix..",
      "This is very nice app, I enjoyed it more. And I like to sing here. But sometimes, when i upload my song, there is not getting any sound of my voice, getting only music."

(A very stupid game for a 7 years old kid like me)",

      "I always wanted to change a mobile phone ringtone, but my friend on the Apple system said that it can only be changed on a computer, and then recommended me a mobile phone software. The complexity is not particularly complicated. It can be done in the picture tutorial, and added their QQ customer service. . I feel okay. I also helped me record my favorite songs. I do n’t know why I did n’t record the sound. Hahaha, thank you. After that, I changed several ringtones myself. It feels great and has a great sense of accomplishment.",
      "It ’s not as easy as holding a bunch of stamps. It ’s really easy to use. It ’s very helpful. The customer service is great all day and very late. I ’m very patient and teaches me step by step. I can learn how to use it. I can also pass on my favorite music. Download it. The benefits for Apple users can be done without a computer! !! !! One hundred faint! !! !!",
      "Ok who is wasting their time paying 85 dollars a week for some stupid wallpaper... Go to Zedge. Most of their wallpapers are free and they are all good. Plus, the ones that aren't free are all a dollar... 3 day trial for a wallpaper??? What a joke. Like seriously, thats a knee slapper... Every five star review was a bribe.",
      "This software is good. It uses the library band that comes with Apple. The steps are very clear, relatively simple, and well received. It is equivalent to using this app to directly generate songs / videos in the format Apple wants (should be Right) Then add it to the library band and share it to my mobile ringtone, you can find it in the settings sound",
      "DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP Absolutely a waste of time to download. Not only is there a \"3 day free trial\" to access the app but it charges you over $100/week to keep access. Wallpapers are just terrible. Seems like just some people trying to scam money off anyone they can."

      "It's actually a pretty solid app. It does some odd things, for instance when you start watching something from the Series page of that show it will automatically go to the next episode like Netflix and hulu. When you play from the resume watching section it instead goes to the next thing on the resume watching list instead of the next episode. I don't think that makes a lot of sense",
      "Since the started using Vimeo for videos the app is absymal. It randomly stops playing or if you pause or seek through a video it crashs and begins the video again, cadting is dreadfull it very rarely works, episdoes to not play in order, it take about 10-15 minutes to get it to load,play and cast a video and even then it might not even play. Vimeo destroyed this. Cant believe the content is so good and they cant spare a little cash on a decent app to showcase it all. Very disappointed.",
      "I love the content but the app needs some love and care. It logs me off out of nowhere, doesn't keep track of which videos I've watched and where I stopped correctly. I watch it through casting to my Chromecast so it may be related but still, I wish it'd work better.",
      "If i pause the video for about 10 to 15 minutes and then play it, the video will still pause yet the sound is playing. And if i stop it, it will be error to play all videos. I need to restart not only the apps, but my phone in order to make it work again. Thats the reason i stop my previous subscribsion.",
      "The content is awesome but the app is a bit clunky. The Continue Watching doesn't work well, and videos that I've finished watching, sit there on the list and won't go away. The video player needs some work but it's not awful."
