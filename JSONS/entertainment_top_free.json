    "comments":[
      "Streaming to tv has improved a lot, but you still cannot decide what level of HD you want to stream based on the bandwidth you have. You can do it for downloads, sort of (low/med/high), but this doesn't really tell you anything except for how many hours you can store. This is useless for phone users who may want to tailor the quality to their phone's resolution. Also, I think the older Simpsons episodes are still oddly cropped to fit 16:9, which cuts off some of the image.",
      "Lots of content, but the app is trash. The app is not at all feature-rich, and it is often glitchy. Most shows are 2min long, and it stops playback after every show. This drives my kids nuts, which in turn drives me nuts. I dont want to have to find and play a new episode every 2 min or less. Netflix has set the bar on what to expect from a streaming app, and disney cannot compete. Casting to another device, is never a smooth experience.",
      "Update March 22: after downloading an update for the app, now I can't watch anything. The audio come through but the screen just stay black. For all the shows and movies. Please fix. If you haven't update, don't do it!! __________________ Does not work in note 10 I have a note 10 plus and I get the error 83. Still waiting for the fix. Thanks.",
      "App almost always has issues loading, they don't have all the promised content and the downloads keep stalling. Update: Canceled subscription due to issues, but reactivated to give it another shot. Same issues, and now it will also not download content. Anything I want to load just sits in the queue waiting, verified settings and internet connection. Some new content has been added, but there is still quite a few gaps. They also seriously need to fix the formatting on the Simpsons episodes.",
      "Got the app when it originally came out a few months back to watch the mandalorian... But the moment the season stopped I tapped out because the app does not work. It freezes. Audio de-syncs. Not worth the money when other streaming services can provide subtitles, and fluid streaming. And if you look up the problem it just falls back onto your internet speeds... which I do not have a problem with. I regularly sit at 24mbps. Disappointed and will be uninstalling again."

      "I've been using netflix for a while now. Most of the times i download shows so I can watch while on the go. But the thing that is hassle now is I can't even watch anything now. Not even my downloaded content. Also my bill is recurring so I hope it gets fixed right away. When I select a show that I want to watch is says \"The title is not available to watch instantly\", then on the downloaded content \"there is a problem. please try again later.\" Idk if it's just me? anyone also experiencing this?",
      "Good app for new shows and movies, I will be keeping it. If you are looking for older tv shows Hulu is the way to go. With both I feel like I have plenty of options. I have not tried amazon prime so cannot comment on that. No matter what you get there will always be that one show that you will have to sign up for Starz, HBO, Showtime, etc in order to watch but overall with netflix and hulu along with a 3 hour window a day to watch tv I feel like there is plenty to keep me busy.",
      "My first day and I've already had show's stopped till I picked the tablet up and assured Netflix I was still watching... about a dozen times. If you plan to grab something from the fridge or go to the bathroom, etc. expect your show to be stopped...and if really slow the app to lose your place. Haven't decided if this will be worth it or not. I will update in a few days if this is an everyday acurance when streaming. The content is good. Just not user friendly/convenient.",
      "I just changed my device three days ago and I re-downloaded the Netflix app. Since then Netflix has been saying \"can't reach the Netflix service\"! This is beyond infuriating as my subscription is wasting and I can't even use the money I have paid for. I need this fixed as soon as possible. I can't even log in via browser. I can't even reach your customer care either because they are not allowing me to call. Fix this!!! I am using a Tecno Spark 4 Air.",
      "I love the series the good place but i found out that theres a fourth season. Netflix doesnt have it along with many other shows i watched Netflix makes you wait a year until you can watch the next season. Other than that there arnt any adds or any other reason not to like it. But when you go to update it, Netflix doesn't tell you what its updating."

      "I'll state my couple of drawbacks first to get those out of the way. Not all movies have captions, so options for the hard of hearing community are more limited. Lots of amateur movies, or flat out corny, particularly among sci fi, so if you don't like that there's that. That being said, many great movies are on here. It's accessible via computer or phone, super easy to navigate. Suggested options aren't repetitive. Ads are short, and allow for the best part. It's free",
      "I've just installed this and am about to watch my first movie on it. 5 stars for being free and transparent about how this app works...ie...ads. Given the current state of things with COVID-19 it's great to have this app to pass the time. I've only briefly glanced at the movie selection, but I'd like to see more current titles in the future. Lots appear to be old movies and/or ones I've never heard of. Hopefully I can leave my review at 5 stars after I've had more time to utilize it.",
      "Little specific complaints, but here's a few. Unique movies, nothing wrong with this just aren't my jam. I wanted to watch the film Rango, as shown in 2 of the images of the app, and it didn't have it, tad annoyed. Good interface Few ads Its free! I mean theres a chance I won't keep this forever but this is worth it as you lose nothing. Would recommend, 8/10",
      "Only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because you can't find \"common\" shows. Alot of \"knock-offs\". But it's free so can't complain too much. There's ads as if you're watching TV, but the app has to get paid somehow right? So long as we don't find out later that they steal or sell info, I don't have much to complain about. Will continue to use it till they run out of shows!",
      "I rated 4 stars bc nothing in life is %100 perfection. Everything's going to have a flaw.....the only issue here is the same as any other viewing platform is that there are ads . Eventhough ads are necessary, there are only a couple spots throughout a full show where ad commercials popped up. They were quick and painless! Great app.....love it....will keep it!! 🤘🤘"

      "Hulu live TV no ads it's a joke, every show I tried to watch has commercials. I cancelled, then resubscribed to get Hulu no ads for $11.99 a month, most all of the shows are actually commercial free. The only problem is the library is limited. ABC, NBC, and FOX shows are great with no ads. They have the current episodes, as well as classic TV shows. You have to wait until 2 am the next day to watch new episodes. You can watch General Hospital after 5pm the same day, which is cool .",
      "Hulu is great when it works, but that's only sometimes. The app is laggy and slow, plenty of weird errors, sometimes it just refuse to start. Poor customer service, almost no feedback when something goes wrong which is often. LiveTV crash or just refuse to work, and more commercials than you expect to see, especially if you pay for \"Hulu (No Ads)\" Will be looking elsewhere. I spend more time watching the free streaming services more, just because I'm sick of fighting with Hulu to get it to work correctly.",
      "Used to be good. They went and changed the entire home page platform which isnt helpful or pleasing. Only way I can look through the episodes of a show is by searching it, which is time consuming. If i turn it off and then on it starts the show over from the previous episode even if I'm on the next episode. Used to not have adds and now all of a sudden I do ( i pay for my membership).",
      "Love this app. Beat the area cable company by a mile. Always something to watch and the DVR is amazing. Just one problem the past few days. It has started to buffer a lot. Thought it might be a device cleaning issue. But cleaning doesn't help. Hoping the new update will take care of this. Other than that, I love this.",
      "Mixed Bag. The programming, cloud recording, and price are great. Cons include VERY frequent app crashes on LG Web OS TV even with hard wired data connection, no picture in picture when accessing program guide on LG TV, and overall a slow to respond app on LG TV. It seems many, many people have the same issues. App seems geared for mobile devices and desktops primarily. Address the app issues concerning smart Tv's and it would be a five star service."

      "This was the best. Since I've had my Note 10+, about a month, this app was working great. Why did you have to ruin it? While there was room for improvement, the new channel listing stinks. In portrait, the picture shrinks to a ridiculously small thumbnail, if you want to browse through the list while watching something else. Show info is gone. Often,the list is mostly blank. But worst... the show's are constantly buffering. Thanks for breaking what really didn't need fixing.",
      "Latest update looks nice, but it's missing a key feature and the usability has decreased. (1) Favorites are missing. (2) Vertical categories requires more scrolling and tapping than the useful horizontal menu. (3) Last channel viewed is not remembered after closing and reopens to a different channel. (4) Picture-in-picture no longer works. Despite these issues, this is still my favorite TV app.",
      "It's a good way to watch TV on the PS4 but could not activate it with my android device. Opened app, logged in, went to my pluto, but nowhere to enter my activation code. Looked everywhere on the app but did not find the activation and ended up frustrated. Only reason I downloaded this on my phone and created an account was because it said I would be able to use my phone as a control but, a little hard to do that when pairing doesn't work. About to uninstall this from my phone",
      "I definitely don't like the updated version of the Pluto TV at all. It takes too long to start. It doesn't restart on the previous channel that you watched. I can't change the channel like the older version. I have to turn off the Pluto TV to get to a station that I like. I'm thinking about uninstalling the Pluto TV app. It doesn't list the shows anymore on the updated version. What happened to the Wahlburgers TV Show in the 300s channel? Overall I'm Very Much Disappointed in the updated version",
      "Worked great until it updated, use to load up fast and not freeze, now it lags, the color guide was better than the black and white guide now, pictue is clear I must say, I know it's free, but if it's not broke, don't fix it. I do recommend this app for an alternative to watch tv on the go."

      "This goddamn stupid app. I try to open games through it and the screen goes into landscape view and back to portrait. That's all it does. And then dumps me out of the app. Also, for the last year and a half I've been constantly told that this app is required to play certain games. But it isn't. It's just another greedy data-mining exercise by Google so they can avoid paying any taxes and carry on being the world's biggest spy agency without any oversight. You suck, Google!",
      "Love Design Home. With a few changes they could be fabulous. I have learned many things about decorating and find the information from professional decorator's. However those much needed changes are few and far between. Such a shame! With the right incentives and making paintings, plants, and other decorative items accessible with diamonds and play cash. This would be add more opportunties to purchase those items. Otherwise real world currency is needed to keep decorating rooms. Its unfortunate",
      "This game at the beginning was bad now it's pretty good but still just so many issueslike as soon as you play it the controls just don't don't if you're going to make a game make it right please f******because I'm tired of playing just seen this do not install worst game in the it's a bit better now but still controls don't work fix that and you might have a good game for now I suggest you go to hills of steel 2",
      "Hello Development.. I am using this great program from the great Google company,And I think one of its advantages is keeping progress in games,And when entering compatible games, the game is registered in the profile,But the problem is that when I log in, nothing happens ,, I don’t know how to save progress or download a copy of saved data, to install my progress ,, the problem is that I don’t understand how it works ,, My device A10 Can you please reply as soon as possible?",
      "I have been using this app for 4+ years and it has (mostly) saved my progress on the games I have installed. Now in this recent update, ALL of my progress have been erased for more than 20+ games! An the worst part about it, it says I'm signed into all my apps, but when I try signing in to Play Games, it won't even show my progress at all. So if your planning on having an app that sometimes DELETES all of your 3+ years work of time of playing games, then I would recommend it to someone who is willing spend money to get your progress back after this app has been on for 45 minutes. Also BTW I deleted this after I made this review :)"

There may be a good library in there, but it is hard to tell...",

I would really like to watch season 1 of some series before starting on season 2 or 3 but they are not available for viewing, defeats the idea of binge watching. Great selection, just missing a few odds and ends.",

I've tried to restart app, cleared cache, navigate through the Amazon app but only to keep crashing when it launches Prime Video. I've also logged out the Amazon app, and login directly in Prime Video then I'm prompted to enter CAPTCHA and OTP. After completing the process, I've tried to login and was prompted again for CAPTCHA and still not working. Tried to contact support but waited too long.",
      "Really bad experience. Absolutely unorganized library and very bad settings options, no way to manually change video settings, I have to watch everything in fluctuating video quality, absolutely unstable. Did a mistake to subscribe for 1 year. They are not accepting my card for free trial of 30 days. Plz think before wasting money.",
      "Every single time I attempt to open the app (after uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting my phone, etc.) it tell me there is an \"issue with my account, when clearly there is no issue as I have not even SIGNED IN to my account yet when this happens, as well as the fact that I can use amazon video perfectly fine on my other device (not the app, on a Chromebook) so the only explanation is there is some inherently wrong with the app. Basically, this app is useless."

      "So bad is not even funny. Instead of being able to voice chat on the switch like every console produced in the last decade you need this app. Instead of working like every other Voice chat app instead Nintendo decides when you can talk to people, which is normally when you are both playing the same game, but sometimes it just refuses to work. Completely unnecessary and completely broken.",
      "The fact that we have to pay for an online service that doesn't even include a built in communication system is mindblowing. The Wii had a better online service TWO DECADES AGO! With that being said, the fact that this App is even required is a joke. An even bigger joke is that the App won't even work, let alone open... Nintendo please do better",
      "I think this is pretty useful but for Animal Crossing I was hoping for a more instant messager feel. It's a little awkward that I have to go back and forth between my phone and Switch just to see if my friend responded to my message. Also for the QR codes, a way to just upload a picture from our phone gallery of the codes would be nice.",
      "Works fine and as intended. The team builder for Super Smash Bros Ultimate is cool, but you can only build on the phone then need to go to your switch and have the team sent over when it's done. At least it's good for viewing shared content. Splatoon 2's splatnet is quite useful and the app does show your stats, but that's about it. I've never used the voice chat from the app, but it seems a bit odd since I'm using another app to talk anyway, so I wouldn't use this app's voicechat",
      "I got this just to download QR codes for ACNH. Why should I pay a subscription? QR codes were included in New Leaf. You cannot expect people to pay £50-£60 for a triple A release title to then lock a feature that was included in an older game behind a pay wall. I don't even want Nintendo switch online. I JUST want QR codes! 😭"

      "This is one of my favorite apps. I always lose my remotes and the roku app always works perfectly from literally anywhere in my house. So For example if I am on my back porch I can press play and my kids show will start. It's also really cool that you can stream the roku channel on your device with the app. I'm still kicking myself for buying a replacement remote last year before I knew about this app. It's so easy to use my three-year-old uses it to control his TV. Don't change a thing!",
      "It's great when it works, the private listening feature is particularly useful and just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it's buggy as hell and does not work most of the time. With private listening on the audio will often lag and sputter so much that eventually my phone will disconnect from the tv. No problems with connectivity when private listening is off, but that feature is basically my only use for the app. Sometimes sputtering audio will keep playing long after the video's paused.",
      "If I could make use out of the private listening feature it would have been a 5 star rating for sure! I can't seem to figure out how to use it and if I even can use it in the way I hoped to use it. At night when my family is sleeping and I don't want to bother them with the TV volume too loud I thought that I could nix that problem with the private listening feature but doesn't seem to work that way. Without that 1 issue 5 stars would be there without question!😞",
      "Half of the time it works, half the time it doesnt. It's handy to have when I lose my remote, but is constantly glitching. If I needed the app for more than a few moments at a time, like if I were to have lost my remote completely, I'd find it to be a nuisance. Which makes sense.. As a company, trying to sell products. It would be wiser to make an app more annoying than buying a new remote. In that same breath.. It's tolerable enough to ignore and laugh about to myself."

I sincerely doubt I'll be using either platform at all.",

We should be able to pick out the type of learning material and not have it picked out for me .",

      "I've just started and have completed my first two pictures. The art work is excellent. The colouring in is helped by the number you are working being highlighted in the picture. It also shows if you have finished all the spaces needing that colour with a circle completing itself around that number. My kids love it too. You can also enlarge to help get the tiny areas. Definitely recommend it to everyone.",
      "I really enjoy this game lots and lots because I like art and this game is really something that gives you another point of art instead of just going and have to go into the store and buy paper and colors and all of that you can just sit here get your iPad or your computer or your phone out and just tap on these little color item things to color and is really fun and nice enjoyable and when you get done with all of them you can go back and look at them and say oh my gosh I have did all",
      "I absolutely love this game, but it keeps glitching on me. I have almost 2,000 pictures colored (I've had the game for a while) and almost all of the things completed that give free hints. Then the game will glitch and it won't load the pictures that I've colored and it completely erases all of the things I completed so that I have to start them all over. I delete and redownload the game and everything will work fine for a few days then glitch again and I have to delete/redownload all over again",
      "Much improved and now very enjoyable. Suggestion: water mark on images needs to be smaller or eliminated. 6.27.2017 update This is the best \"paint by number' app I've use. Developer is constantly adding new content. Highly Recommend! I'm not associated with the developer and my opinion is my own. 03/20/2020 Use this app everyday. The developers continue to improve and add new picts. FB links give you option of obtaining new content. Developer ask for input from users and make changes, addition.",
      "I do like the pictures, it would be a really really good app if it weren't for all the ads. I hate how you have to watch a ad before and after a picture, I do like that most of them are skippable. My app also has a glitch, when I finish a color it doesn't highlight the new color. Normally it fixes itself quickly but sometimes I have to find the color before it will highlight itself."

      "When I downloaded I was turned off by the very large amount they charge ($59.99 for a year) you do get a free 3 day trial but if you don't remember to decide whether or not it benefits you or you like it then you just lost $59.99 for food and other bills~! On the plus side it is entertaining and I could see it be a great platform for musicians, dj and comedians! I would love to get to try the Dolphin Anymoji :-)",
      "So, I like the app, but i can't say i love it, when you get to do the face stuff, It has bad quality, so it is hard to make it look sad, so this app isn't bad, but i wish it had better quality, next, you can only use a few faces, and that is sad, you can't even play Jojo Siwa!😭😧😠 Stop making it to where you can use only 3 faces.",
      "I really like this app but, it is also laggy on my phone and I can barely see the settings, and when I stick my tongue out it doesn't, I am not trying to be mean but, can you fix that? Thank you! And I don't know if it is only laggy on my phone. Thank you!",
      "You can only do a free trial for three days!!😭 And then you have to pay $60 a year!😡😭 The bad thing is that I REALLY wanted this app, but nope! Way too much for an app... If the creators see this comment please make the app either cheaper, or ACTUALLY free..",
      "I love it, now I dont have to but an iPhone. Definitely not as great quality as an iphone. But I'm so impressed how this is the almost the same thing as iPhones. I love how you dont have to pay to use the thing, I like how theres free ones! Definitely considered for you guys to get this app awesome and I'm still amazed. ❤🥳"

      "Good quality and a pretty decent interface, but the ads are ridiculous. Most streams force you to watch a 30 seconds ad before you can actually start viewing what your use the app for. From there, it just gets worse. I've frequently been subjected to SEVEN straight ads of 15 to 30 seconds in duration. That means a few full minutes of interruption, which always come at the worst time of the steam and they aren't skippable in any way. Oh, and you'll see the same handful of ads over and over.",
      "Was good starting out. But now I can't see certain people for whatever reason. I can go to other streamers and see them just fine, but for one group which I also follow on YouTube as well as Twitch, I can hear them, but not see them. This is really irritating because I used to be able to see them, but after an update it leaves me with a black window. The streamers belive its because they're using iPhones and I'm using a Samsung, but that seems like a really stupid reason. Please fix.",
      "Great behind the scenes and you can multitask with a background window, which many will love. Also extra points go to this app cause this can livestream certain games others can't. The only reason that it doesnt have five stars is that it has a certain delay and its missing some features other apps have but if does i will be glad to fix this rating to five stars",
      "So the content is great. App works okay, if you sit your phone up, don't touch it, and preferably stream only audio. If you go into pop up, it will lag and sometimes just stop. It will lag and stutter all the time, no matter the stream. It loses your place in VODs for channels you're subscribed to while you're watching then if *anything* else happens on your phone, and now, it's been playing BLARING ads over top of streams I'm subscribed to. I'd love to list more issues but I'm out of space.",
      "Update on Feb 24 (recent) killed audio only and background audio play on my s8. It was working fine for months/years until the update yesterday. Hopefully some bug they can fix quik. Already tried reinstalling the app and nothing. Other than that it's been working fine. Will update when fixed. And yes background audio is enabled."

      "The mobile version of this app is frustrating. It's great when it decides to work but 95% of the time, the app wont load, when it does load and play a video, it is constantly freezing. It also will freeze and then skip back by itself and replay audio that has past and then start playing again just to freeze again. Can we please have someone look into this and actually fix it????!!!",
      "I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. The episodes. Don't play without glitches, if they play at all. One minute I can watch on my TV, the next I can't. Then there's the mobile app, which is a total loss. But what is REALLY effing annoying and weird, is that an episode is English dubbed one second, and Japanese subbed the next. And it happens, WHILE YOU'RE watching!!! I appreciate funimarion for providing fans with dub options, but the app is a disaster. And the website is even worse.",
      "App needs work. Clicking on things like \"recently add\" takes you to list that keeps refreshing when you get to the end. What looks like 100s of shows is really just the same 15 shows repeated again and again. Click on a show and going back takes you all the way to the top of the list. There is also video playback issues... forever to load, pause and can't continue. Want to go back or skip forward a few seconds, nope, video stops working. Overall just a poor UI. Also needs a night mode.",
      "This is my second review. I noticed you respond regularly to these however instead of \"talk to customer support\", \"sorry you're having a bad time.\" and shrugging off doing something about it put some effort into fixing the app or just take it down. You have all the clear consistent information you need to figure it out: laggy, freezes, slow, bad resolution ect. It's not us it's you and we would dearly love for you to fix it so we can actually enjoy the content you provide.",
      "I have this app on my phone, it's really awesome. I love it, but it won't let me subscribe even on the website, and I would like to. Sometimes when I go to a different page it's just blank, and I have to start all over. Not all the episodes of some anime are in English and I'm not really into reading subtitles so I have started some and don't finish. Other than that I deal with it and will continue watching, and trying to subscribe."

      "Terrible. You open the app and doesn't let you play. It immediately wants you to buy the pro option. You can't play unless you buy it. This makes me think that there probably isn't just a free play option. Edit: found out that this company stole parts of a vidio on YouTube for their ads. The uploader did not give permission, and it's not even the same game. This is a terrible product, and the developers should be ashamed.",
      "Stupid touch app, lets you drag slime over the screen and charges 81$ for access to more slime. My 4 yr old has bought VIP, currently trying to gain a refund. I understand my child should have been watched a little closer, but even that aside, if I had bought this app for that much, it would still prompt a refund since the cost simply is not justified by the product. Will hopefully be able to repost a nice story soon.",
      "I mean I with alot of people on 1 star reviews! This app is horrible you can't play it because you get bored waiting for the X so then you can get of this add wanting you to buy products!Its getting annoying coming on a app that used to be great no adds or anything but now its just ruined! I hope nobody bought that add because its a waste! Whoever made this should be ashamed!",
      "Never got around to playing as the fact it's subscription-based put me off. Three days of free trial followed no free option but an immediate £49.49, whatever it was, is ridiculous considering the potential nothingness of this game. *edit - apparently there IS a free option, however the developers have designed this (very sneakily) so that it takes a long time for the X to close down the subscribe option (according to some reviews at least).",
      "lmao its funny how you dont even get do try it. it doesnt even deserve a 1 star, there should be none. its really funny tbh. if it were to have like, 5 options, then it would have been way better, but unfortunately, there is nothing. i expected less anyways. it looked, like not sketchy but kinda. disappointed, but defs not surprised."

      "I downloaded this ap specifically for easy volume management, but it doesnt control the volume at all. My monitor and Xbox set up was bought at a pawn shop, so it didnt come with a remote for volume. When im in the remote control part of the app, the play/pause features work, but the volume doesnt do anything. There is no possible way to adjust the volume, as i dont have the Kinect thing to use voice. I really hope this gets fixed",
      "This app is absolutely egregious. I can never connect properly because I keep getting the infuriating \"something went wrong message\". This app hasn't been updated in a long time and I know other people understand my issue. The party always lags and thats if I can even get into one. I'm forced to uninstall and reinstall to hope to connect. Please just fix this app already.",
      "This app is good at least when it works most of the time I open the app and go to my friends and it says \"something went wrong when loading this section\" and I close the app open it again and it does the same thing. I have re opened the app at least 10 times and it has not worked at all I even deleted the app and signed out of my account and it didn't work at all please fix this problem it really makes me mad.",
      "This app barely works. The main reason i use it is to see what friends are online from my phone or to reply and send messages: which 9 times out of 10 it wont work. Says it failed to load and then thats just it, close it, reopen it, and boom same result. These same issue exist on the windows 10 version of the app also, only way worse. Pretty disappointing.",
      "It worked fine for a bit but now it won't show anything unless I join a club and now that doesn't even work. All my friends are apparently offline even though I'm speaking to them on discord and there playing a game made by Microsoft. It lags constantly and sometimes it crashes for no reason, just sad to see an app made by a huge company be so terrible at it's one job."

      "really fun! I love the sticker selection there are so many to choose from, I could literally have a whole conversation by just using the stickers! The only reason I gave 4 stars is simply that I tried to make one for my boyfriend and his biker crew and I couldn't get anything close to a avatar that looked like him. He is a biker and has long gray hair and a long beard to go with and there isn't a long beard or any biker attire (leather vest or jacket) .. if u can fix this I can rate 5 stars!",
      "The option to pick and choose our own outfit was the best thing that ever happened to BM, because there were plenty of good-enough outfits I wouldn't use because of this or that, and now that's no longer an issue. The new items are great, but we're still missing tights and longer socks in the stockings section. And not being able to delete old outfits is odd, and bloats the closet. But other than that one of the best apps I ever used. 100% recommended to spam your contacts with.",
      "I used to have so much fun with this. My complaint is the new way of going through all the \"new\" categories is really cumbersome... It was perfect before, I could look through almost every choice by going to search and just putting a letter in and it would show me EVERY pic choice that starts with whatever letter I chose! Now it doesn't work! so often I don't know which pic will be the perfect one for my purpose until I see it!! Please change search back, it's not fun anymore for me like this!",
      "I absolutely love it! I got my little guy who dressed in my team apperale that I actually do wear pretty much 24/7 or so it was brought to my attention. Lol. Choice of straw and black felt cowboy hats wich I wear when I dont have my team cap on. He's even got a few semi naughty insinuations that I wish I could get more of! Lol. Fun little app no dout about it. The more you play around with it the better you will get with it. I can do about 80% conversation with mine if I want!!!",
      "The app is fun to use as is. I would like to see more wardrobe options (like being able to create a shirt or dress with stripe or polka dot options with your own color choice or being able to layer articles of clothing). Also it would be nice to be able to use whatever picture emoji I'd like and add my own personalized message within the picture."

      "This is the real thing! I have been paid well over $100.00 in gift cards. at $5.00 each. they keep super detailed count of your earnings and I have never had a single problem. I could have made 4 times more had I followed their suggestion about how long to interact with each game. sometimes I would play a single game for over an hour when they had reminded me that the 4 minutes were over and went back. I have tried all of the other make money while playing, but none have come close. Kat B.",
      "Decided since we all have a lot of time on our hands, I would give this a shot. The 1st $5 was quick & easy so I set my sites on the $25 reward. That seemed to take forever! Still, it's a nice way to get a few extra bucks in your spare time. Also, I decided instead of getting a reward for the theater maybe I should get it for Amazon with the way things are going, I might need those emergency funds for toilet paper! Lol. Seriously tho, anyone reading this, stay safe & healthy please ♡",
      "I have used a lot of apps that reward you for playing games and doing survey's but this one is by far the best one. Within the first 2 days they basically gave me a 5 dollar gift card. Additionally, a few days later I had enough to get another 5 dollar gift card! I also recently had an issue with not being rewarded my points with I the app and contacted support and they fixed the issue for me within a day and a half.",
      "It sucks. All ur apps wont give me videos to watch. I was going good earlier. Now as usual it wont give me points. I've been trying since last july to get 1 of it 25 dollar cards. I've 7nenstalled hundreds of times, cleared all data, and restarted my phone. I've done everything any of u could possibly say for me to do and I still keep has having issues. Even hen I had my phone as brand new Las august someone told me it's my phone that's the problem. Even my moms bran new phone the app dont work.",
      "So glad that it worked! I was using Mistplay (which is awesome, too) and decided to try this one as well. It has multiple times of day where it allows you to get more points playing multiple games for a few hours, surveys, and you can watch ads to support them and or enter a contest to get a 5 dollar gift card. The games you play though do have a limit of having to be played for at least two minutes and those points are only made once a day. But they also have \"extended apps.\""

      "!REVEIW! The app isn't that bad I wouldn't say awful but not it's not amazing. !SLIME! There's not much choices. And if you move your finger fast going round and round it looks really REALLY weird. And the slimes that look good they cost 1 -3 adds or they cost 250 çoins. !COINS/GETTING COINS! I know I should not be complaining about the coins but you have to a least wait 20-60 seconds to collect coins and you only start with 900. I hope you fix these things like adds. Thank you so much!",
      "Way to many slimes were locked even just decrease the amount of locked slimes by a tiny bit and I'll give you another star I've said this before I dont like coins in the slime when you poke a coin it creates a sound so you can't actually hear the slime please improve and I will change my review",
      "It lets you play with slime, but there is not much interaction besides tapping and swishing the slime around. There is also ads for me about another slime app, and not a lot of slime to choose from.",
      "This game is the best 👍💯 , I have play the fancy slime but it let me pay money. But this game is free and is fun you can make your own slime, also have a lot of option to let's you choose and play",
      "I totally recommend this game! It has jelly slime, butter slime, sticky slime, and more. The slime doesn't look realistic, but it moves realistically. My favorite feature of this game was the part where you can make slimes, you can add stuff, pick what kind of slime you want to make, and choose the colors. The only \"bad\" part is it has a bunch of ads. I totally recommend this game. 🙃"

It shows me the commercials without any problems but when it tries to go back to showing the free movie, it restarts the app. Apparently, it's an old problem that still hasn't been fixed. To make matters worse, there's no way to remove expired rentals from your watchlist. This is the worst streaming app yet. I haven't had any issues with Netflix, Disney+ or Prime Video.",
      "App no longer works on my droid turbo 2 phone. Worked for years with no issue but now my library of nearly 100 movies does not play. Just got update and rebooted phone and still not working.. An edit, I was emailing tech support back and forth and their last message to me said I needed to be using Android 5 or newer to which I replied that I'm using version 7 and they never responded back.",
      "Was a five star now a 2. This new update is so all over the place and dumb. My list it is buggy cause if you have or try to add a show on your wishlist it sections it off to allll your lists that are new and just gets you lost. It was one click. We don't need a list page for shows and movies. We have sections that say movies and TV and wishlist if was fine. If we are to lazy to look through our stuff thats our fault. Why can I look at a movie that I don't own and put it in a list? Wishlist? Y",
      "I haven't been able to use disc to digital for months. This was the entire reason I started using VUDU in the first place. Every other app can locate my phone, but not VUDU, so it isn't my phone. It keeps saying location must match Billing address. I am at my Billing address and I used to use this service with no problem. They need to fix this bug or remove the location requirement. This is ridiculous.",
      "I love this app! I've been using it for a very long time. I love that the free movies don't have too many ads and the disk to digital is something I've used a lot. Thank you for adding the list feature too. I like being able to group movies together. Y'all just keep making this app better every time! It'll be 5 stars when I can export it to my sd card."

      "They keep removing features while at the same time doing things the community does not ask for. Many of the features are bots, and the features themselves are randomly chosen. I'm changing my review back to 3 stars now that we can dislike features (something we used to have) but they really need work on making sure features have more 'ifunny' content, less Tumblr screenshots no one likes.",
      "I've been on this app for the past 3 years and it's been one of my favorite apps to kill time,the past few months on the other hand you can see that I funny no longer cares. Their featured list just seems like it uploads random things from the collective. I finally gave up when on the featured list there was a super long depressing comic ending in a man killing himself via drug abuse. This app is called I Funny the creators have given up and just spin a wheel for features at this point.",
      "Honestly I've been a user of this app for a long time and it used to be a genuinely good app. Now, its just facebook/reddit repost memes and bots have taken over the app. Not to mention they took away the shuffle button for the features so you are now forced to look at the crappy memes they let on the features. This app is genuinely a huge let down and I don't think it will ever be as good as it used to be.",
      "1. The shuffle button is gone so you have to look a bad memes instead of the popular ones through the ages 2. The features are from 1-3 day old bots 3. The memes generally need about 20 likes before it's featured 4. Recycling content, and using over 200 memes in 2 hours on the featured page. Anything over 10,000 likes will probably never be seen again. 5. You will never be able to find anything good here ever again.",
      "I rated this app back in 2018, and gave it a pretty solid review. But they have seriously let it go. Since there is no longer a feature team, there are a ton of bot post that fill the feature section with stuff directly from reddit. There is unnecessary censorship of certain words, and since there is no longer a good mof presence, the app will randomly take down posts. Edit: they removed the shuffle button for no reason, amd made collective profile exclusive. Dropping my rating once more"

      "No videos i select apparently have sound files with them. My internet connection is famtastic and all my other apps and devices are woking fine. Even your in videos advertisements are working phenomonally, but when it gets to the part i paid for the soundbyte goes out and its starting to make me angry. Im considering cancelling my subscription.",
      "The HBO app constantly kicks me out of the video saying they can't play the video, forces me to go back to then relaunch the video. I watched a movie where I had to do this about 50 times no joke, this is the most annoying Thing of this app. It would be one thing if it didn't happen on every show but it happens every single program I've ever watched and HBO since the moment I installed this app. I hope HBO has a fix for this because I can't believe I'm the only one that this is happening to",
      "Worst streaming service. Every interaction is frustrating. Too bad your burying good content with terrible ux. Rewind is frustrating. Navigating is frustrating. Getting kicked out is frustrating. Video quality is really bad. Loads forever. None of my other streaming apps do this I have solid fiber connection.",
      "I'm paying $25 a month so that ten minutes into a movie the app can stop working. Permanently. Turn the console off, uninstall the app, switch to a computer, it doesn't matter, the playback ends and won't go past the marker it first buffered at. And yes, it's across all my devices. I can watch Netflix, Hulu and Prime all in 4K but HBO, the most expensive one, crashes constantly. According to the help line, my internet download/upload and latency is more than DOUBLE what HBO requires to playback HD video. Their solution? To email me later when the \"app developers\" think of something. So answer me something. Why am I paying a monthly rate that is bonkers expensive compared to other streaming services for an app that quite actually has more buffering than a movie streaming site that will show me this title for FREE? The only thing this app has going for it is the original content which, while great, you can find anywhere else online with less buffering. And that doesn't cost you $25 a month.",
      "Frustrating interface that is not intuitive. No movie information page is available, it just immediately plays the movie with any touch, useless. Category organization is not employed unless an alphabetical only listing of every movie is the only category. Chromecast functionality appears to work."

      "There is a RIDICULOUS amount of ads in each episode you watch. Not worth your time. When you have to watch 5-9 commercials per interruption and you're interrupted 3-5 times each episode...it's ridiculous. And if you try and skip forward or backward during regular play, you get to do it all again. Can't skip ads either and they automatically sell your info unless you go into the settings and check a box not to",
      "The ads were annoying enough, but now (watching on Chromecast) my phone gets a notification, buzzes, and blocks my screen at the start and end of ads. This interfere with anything I'm doing and adds no value. Moreover it regularly says no connection when there is one, and it can even connect to the Chromecast on my wifi. I'll be deleting the app, and watching with adblocker on web.",
      "I screenshot the shows to my television. I just wish they would have the entire current season of a show, like Riverdale. I'm late to the party I guess. Lol. I haven't had any issues thus far. Also I wish the ads would only play at the beginning and end of the show instead of throughout. They do keep the ads short.",
      "Use to be the best casting app. Now its the worse. Biggest thing, it blows up ur phone with notifications while casting. Every new commercial, pause, play, fast forward, rewind, etc, it sends 1 to 3 loud notifications to ur phone with every action, easily close to 100 notifications per show. You have to silent ur phone. Very annoying. Then it doesnt remember where u left off. Then skips to the next episode. Have to watch 10min of commercials to find where u left off. Note 9. Chromecast Ultra 4k.",
      "This app allowed me to watch the episodes of supergirl, legends of tomorrow and batwoman to name a few that was perfect viewing; not like when I tried to watch them with my dvr where I had been experiencing since Sunday March 01, 2020 I think I was having this problem even in February and my wife even let me know that she has been experiencing these same problems on her TV Pixelation, picture and audio breakup (pausing and missing words) on the CW - WTTOD • 9 (Still happening even now.)"

      "For the app being free with no cable required this is a pretty good app. Lots of reviews are saying that there are too many ads, but personally I don't mind the amount of ads. Plus in regular tv you get commercials anyway so the ads aren't really a problem. The only problem I do have is that parts of episodes in shows are skipped. For example in one show the first 2 episodes were fine but after the middle of the third ep. the skips were VERY frequent and that takes away a big chunk of the plot.",
      "I love that I can now watch every episode of Days of our lives in this app! However, the things that I dislike the most while watching shows/movies more than anything else in the world is commercials and there are 2-7 commercials every 4 mins while trying to watch the show. You can't fast forward or skip them at all and I hate that but otherwise this is a good app! The picture is great and it's almost always perfect never splotchy!!!",
      "Overall I find the application to be quite good, but a big fault would have to be the fact that live broadcast, such as NBC Nightly News takes so long to actually become available. I have other channel apps, which show the last broadcast, just moments after the live feed is complete and I even have my local NBC affiliate app, which broadcast the news live, as it's being shown on television. Waiting for the next day, to be able to watch the news, now more than ever is shocking.",
      "Why have \"locked\" content when you can go to hulu and watch the same show. I binge watched a whole season of law & order svu all the way up to the most recent episode in which you all locked the most recent episode. And you play the same ads over and over. With hulu I pay a few extra dollars for no ads. **UPDATE** New problem. I started watching New Amsterdam on the app. The \"continue watching\" shows episodes I watched already. Hulu does not have season 1.",
      "Major networks putting out apps that function so poorly that its a nuisance to use baffles me. This one, in particular, has shows that are tv originals (in other words, designed for commercial breaks) that break for commercial at the wrong time--even mid-opening theme song. It even returned to the theme song after the commercials....Seriously? Commercial breaks mid-sentence. Like an amateur Youtube video. Love the dreaded black screen that is \"buffering\". Yet Netflix plays flawlessly."

      "Great pictures, but... - Color breakdowns are lazy & don't have any logic or color matching (number 1 covers almost the entire pic & huts almost every part of the spectrum). - Ads very rarely work. - Saving the picture doesn't actually save it anywhere in my Gallery. - Sharing the picture very often crashes the app.",
      "The pictures in the ad look amazing but I can not actually do anything with it because NONE of the images will open and only the top 2 on the screen show what the picture is, all the rest have nonstop loading bubbles. Help, please.",
      "Just downloaded this one, and it is fast becoming my favorite. Extremely beautiful artwork and superb color. I especially like the different artwork they have, particularly the fantastical ones. Other apps have the same artwork, but this one is unique in that all it's artwork is quite new, and not seen anywhere else. I give it 5 stars!",
      "WAY TOO many ads! Pictures are beautiful, but i shouldn't have to watch an ad when I am moving from picture to settings or to return to the one I was coloring! Overload! There are better ones out there! Un-installing!"

      "I had to do an update today, and I'm pretty sure it messed up the app because I went to watch Crainer's live stream and it wouldn't load. I could see the comments but not the stream. This was also an issue for many others, yet a handful of people could see the stream. No sound was available to load either. I know a lot of people have had an issue with your app not working, and I see what they are saying. You really need to tweak a few things to where this hopefully wont happen.",
      "A consumer/clout based app? Statically speaking(or if you just pay attention)apps that take off at a fast rate have faster deaths (Vine, Musicly, give tiktok sometime) .Slow down! Allow your audience to build itself for a sec. I think instead of forcing everyone to only watch you should allow viewers to go live, too. You would be able to maintain this kind of activity, build the servers, and audience at a decent rate. This will take time. Time=Strong Foundation=Power/resources=Longlasting app=$",
      "Negative 5 stars! The worst experience I ever had. Was excited to watch a free live stream of something I usually have to pay for on pay per view. End up wishing I still had to order and pay for it on pay per view. While they have a lot of mainstream people promoting their app. they should invest that money into the actual app amd not advertisement and make a reputable product instead of having to rely off clout of big names...smh",
      "It's a great platform. The streamer/viewer relationship is nice. The only problems are the minor audio/visual bugs. Quite a few people have been having the same problem. You join a stream and either you have no visuals, just audio or vice versa. Please fix?",
      "This app is good for streams other than the one i came for which is the urltv stream. Dont think it can handle the amount of users and they underestimated url fanbase because it lags a lot. Secondly the screen mirror option doesnt work which would be nice for people who don't want to watch on their cellular device."

      "This CBS media streaming app does what it is supposed to: stream content, both free and subscription-based. I started using it on a Moto G7 and now on a Samsung A50, both running Android 9, and it works just fine. Do I wish there weren't any ads? Sure. Did I know what I was signing up for? Yes. Yes I did. So, unless something legitimately wrong or bad happens, I'm going to give it 5 stars.",
      "I have to say that I really have enjoyed Star Trek Picard and Discovery, but I have an issue that needs attention please. We need a way to access the \"Full screen\" mode. Laptops are not like televisions, so the \"widescreen\" mode you have is reducing the Laptop screen size. We appreciate your assistance with this problem. Can we have an option please to exit \"widescreen\" and go to \"Full screen\" mode in the Future? A small request hopefully, as we do pay for the streaming service. Thank you!",
      "This app is not the same as it was the first time I tried it.The first time there were not as many ads as there are now, and it played and casted better than it does now. The show I try to watch has problems casting, when it does work it disconnects then I start it again and instead of starting where it left off it starts at the beginning. By the time you get the program back to where you were it cuts off again. Very aggravating! Thinking about canceling this app just not worth the aggravation",
      "The free access is bogus. I signed up for the free trial & I'm supposed to have limited commercials. I don't. I have constant commercials just like before. False advertising to lure people in. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Cancelling trial since no sense in having it when everything is the same as the free app. Just when I think this app can't get any worse it did. Trying to watch the young & the restless & for the past 45 min I've been watching nothing but commercials which I hate.",
      "I just did your new update and its horrible. Cant even watch my soap. It keeps stopping for long periods! It was fine before, dont fix what isnt broken!!! Now its 3/19/2020 and its doing it again after doing your app update. All i get is a circle in the middle of the screen going around. No other apps have that problem!!! You need an update to fix the update!!! 3/20/2020, I still cant watch Y&R!!!! I get circle going around in middle of screen! It stops for a second, cant understand to 2 words."

      "Very satisfied with Sony playstation app. Love how you guys post things up. And give us a heads up on top scores and deals. What more can a customer like me as for. It's up to us consumers to see what you guys put out there for us. And that's why I love it. Cause I work 2 full time jobs. And if I see a deal or skins for my favorite game and upgrade. I can do it all on my phone. So please Sony don't ever stop what you're doing.",
      "The best thing I can say about it is, it works. As far as how well, it's seriously lacking, the trophies lack many sorting options that other trophy apps have. The store just takes you to a website instead of being like the Xbox app where it's actually part of the app. It needs a PS Now option to download games to your PS. It has like 6 different apps for different features instead of being integrated in one app. There's a lot of things that need to improve.",
      "Helps keep up with friends, but would like a notification when selected friends go online. A feature that can be used when actively on the Playstation, it will notify you when friends you have chosen log into their Playstation. I would like this in a push notification to the app. If they get on to play, I might go join them. As it is now, I have to open the app and look. Otherwise, I find the app useful to browse the Playstation Store, check on trophies and my account.",
      "Worst application ever... Specially with payment method it is totally stupid and unresponsive.. You can't delete add or modify and you can't even use PayPal account... The server is always out... Please shut down this application and let us manage everything from the console. It rejected my credit card which I have successfully used on several local and international website for no apparent reason and it is totally rubbish. Thanks Sony.",
      "Allows you to accomplish several things very well while on the go. You can see what games and deals are currently available in the PlayStation store. Order your digital purchases remotely and have them downloaded to your PlayStation before you get home. Connect to the PlayStation blog for news. The app has many more useful functions than I am listing here. If you are a PlayStation owner this is a vital companion app along with PlayStation messages to enhance your PlayStation experience."

      "Nice but very pricey! Is it worth $54 a month? Let's see, there are commercials throughout the movies. Playback on week old sitcoms like American Idol are loaded with ads that you are not allowed to skip! The cool thing are all the available movies, old shows, new shows, live entertainment, oh wait, there are TV apps that do the same thing BUT THEY ARE FREE!!!",
      "I love this app! We are able to look up movies and tv shows and add them to our list so easily. If we want to catch up on our shows, no problem. They have them. The only thing is I wish it was less in cost. When I first signed up it was a really good deal. They then added more channels and went up on their price because of that. Unstandble, but I wasnt given the choice if I wanted the new channels and the price increase. So, to help with cost, I have to go back to cable. Not what I wanted.",
      "Hands down best streaming app out there!! We had sling TV first, then tried Philo TV. Then went back to sling TV. We were not happy with sling TV because they have too many issues to get worked out. Too many glitches. Since we got YouTube TV we could not be more satisfied. No glitches at all!! We like having a regular guide to pull up to see what we want to watch, YouTube TV has that. We cut the cord and haven't been happy until we got YouTube tv!!!!! Need more space to write. We love it!!!!!!!!",
      "On my mobile devices, this app is a beast. However, it is terrible on my smart TV. Viewing experience is made horrific by occasional buffering, which requires me flipping between channels/shows before it is resolved. Since I haven't watched TV using this app on other smart TVs per se, I don't know if the fault is from my smart TV - which, by the way is the latest Philips Smart TV, with built in Google assistant for that matter - or from the app/ToutubeTV.",
      "Decent service for the money but way too many sports channels. At least we get local news channels, unlike HULU, which gave us news channels based on our wifi location not our physical location. Only other drawback is that when you delete a recording it doesn't remove it from your list until 9 months after the record date. Definitely beats paying the high price of cable."

      "A very nice app in the free streaming service category. It has a very good selection for my age demographic. I am, however, only giving 4 stars because it lacks one feature for use on my device: there is no way to clear the \"Continue Watching\" feature. Sometimes you may begin a movie or show that you don't want to continue (because you've changed your mind once it began). How do you clear that feature? Please fix this and I'll gladly add the final star.",
      "Interface is fine for a free streaming app. 8 commercials per movie is tolerable considering how, again, it's free. That being said, is it really too much to ask that I'm able to enjoy what I'm streaming? The ads conveniently play perfectly every time. The movie/TV part however, not so much. My screen kept freezing as audio continues to play and then turns green. This happened several times within the first 20 minutes of just one movie. I'm sorry, but that makes it unbearable to watch.",
      "Seemed to be okay at first my first time watching a movie, that is until I experienced the ads. I'm not opposed to some ads by any means, it is free after all. The problem is they run choppy, sometimes out of sync with voice. The time doesn't match up. It will go back to the movie for 3 seconds, then go back to the ads all over again as if I hadn't watched the ads at that interval yet. After what was supposed to be like 1 minute of ads to continue watching, I was really at 3 or 4 minutes.",
      "ZERO STARS. I tried watching movies on CRACKEL but VOLUME LEVEL WAS SO LOW~ ~>Icouldnt even HEAR THE MOVIE enough to tell what was going on. Maddening!. I used the closed captioning because I am severely hearing-impaired CLOSED CAPTIONING. It's not enough I can hear well enough to watch movies other apps! If that wasn't enough when the ads came on it blasted me out of my seat and I had to move my phone over 2 feet away from ME it was SO DARN LOUD! If you're handicapped, I highly advise against",
      "Woof. All I can say is... This is bad. They've got a great selection of titles that are unique and would be wonderful to watch... If the UI wasn't so, incredibly and painstakingly BAD. Want to stream from your phone to smart TV? Good luck. Did you get distracted from your show to read this review? Well you're not even able to rewind. It's THAT bad. I'm not sure if this is supposed to resemble a Netflix competitor or a cable company from 1997 before we had the luxury of a DVR. What a shame."

      "Its meh, it has about 10 ads per episode, but they are at the very beginning and at the end, 5 at the start 5 at the end, so it's not that bad. Where else are you gonna watch anime for free? But my worst complaint is the buffering, it buffers like once every 2 or 3 minutes, and it takes around 10 seconds in total to stop. And I have pretty good internet. But if it wasn't that frequent or didnt exist, then I would very easily rate it 4 or 5 stars.",
      "I really like this streaming service, but on the phone app it is filled with issues. But my major problem is that it takes so damn long to load and still when it loads sometimes it stops in the middle of an episode, or the video stops and the audio goes back a few seconds and you have to wait for the audio to catch up. And in pc you have none of these problems, so I always keep thinking, why pay for this since you can just go on pc and use an adblocker. I am really frustrated with this app.",
      "The app really has a problem. Whenever I click on any video, the app tells me that its stopped working and that I need to reload. I've uninstalled and installed the app multiple times and the problem still won't go away. I really want to watch anime when I'm not at home but can't because Crunchyroll has \"stopped working\". I'm not even going to try anymore. Maybe get that fixed, please. However, this is a great place to watch all of your favorites for free and you get new episodes really quick :)",

There are apps like the Netflix one that I've never had an issue with, but does the same thing as this one... stream shows. It baffles me as to how this problem has yet to be fixed after reading so many others who also have this issue. I just want to be able to watch my shows without it constantly stopping and starting. First world problems aye.",
      "Nice app...when you actually get to watch it. Ads in a free version are fine, when they work. A 25 sexond ad takes about 2 minutes as it buffers constantly. Some ads run fine. Some of them need me to restart the episode as they just don't play. It's not every ad by the way. The figurine site ad works fine, but the insurance one freezes at about the 6 second mark for example. Pretty sure it isn't my connection as well. Otherwise the app works as intended."

      "Can't reveal any of my characters anymore. Take a survey for each and every one unless I pay 4 dollars for premium. Try to do a survey, doesn't work and doesn't allow me to reveal character at all. All of my guessed characters are \"rare\" characters that are hidden behind paywall. You guys are losing money at this point by doing this. I could still be playing the game and looking at the already existent ads, or I could get the stupid \"rare\" character and bot play at all. REMOVE THE FEATURE.",
      "I hate how you have to buy to see a \"rare character\". I suppose that's the scheme of many apps, but it happens so frequently when you actually try to think up of characters. I suppose that's the scheme of this app, but it just feels so... blocked from certain features unless you pay.",
      "Every character for me is a \"rare character\" which just means that i have to do a survey, watch a 30sec video or pay to see if the genie actually got it right or not. It would be one thing if it says what it guessed and then you have to do the stuff to get the medal but cmon man. Every time?",
      "The game is fun but the \"rare\" characters are annoying from the forced not seeing it after all the questions or the 30 min ad and the survey asks personal questions like your zip code and job it's really creepy that they want to know this stuff about you if you take the survey PLEASE LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING! they are collecting personal information that shouldn't be shared"

      "This app deserves ALOT more than 5 stars. You can never find any disney shows or movies on Youtube, and this app has it all!! Full seasons, episodes, movies etc! And every episode, you get 1-2 ads. I'm not saying that's good, but it's not bad. I would TOTALLY recommend this app for people who don't have it yet!😀😀",
      "This app is Amazing, but I hate that you have to have a TV provider to watch a Lot of things, This is a problem for people who don't have a TV provider, And many of My family members including me are upset about this, I would rate the app Five stars, if this feature Was Removed, But Other than that, The app is pretty good,",
      "This is a really bad game and i would put a negative 1 because you need to put in your tv provider put the dum thing is that some people dont have to put in their email but others do. When i put it in, it says prossesing error even if i have a lot of internet. It would be a good game but this is a real problem for me. Please fix this!",
      "I don't know how I should feel about this app. It has stuff I couldn't find on the Disney+ app which is a good thing but... Having only 2 episodes of Pokemon or just a handful of episodes for a lot of the shows here makes me want to go to the Disney+ app. I suggest either putting full seasons on here or focus more on disney+. For what it is this isn't a bad app just it lacks the content to make it worth it. I don't even know of anything here worth keeping this app. Maybe tangled... But that's it",
      "Disneynow is such a good app because you can you can watch any episode that comes out on that day if you have to wait until late in the night and you get Queens and as rewards to get fun emojis emojis for your profile and you can play games also to get coins as well and I just love it so much so yeah and I hope that it gets better and better one thing that I would. I would say to Disney now is that they should put on Wizards of Waverly Place there in the app and Hannah Montana."

If the supervisor in charge of this project were smart, they would fire the person currently serving as the project lead and bring some new talent in to maximize the potential of this offering. Unless they DON'T want you to actually play and win. And if that IS the case (and it seems very likely based on my product experience): WELL DONE!",
      "Last year it worked decently this year it is a catastrophe.. Nothing seem to work?? I keep getting error code and can't even get to the page and once getting there it works for 1-2 scans, that takes forever, and then crashes again. Please fix it.. I have like 100 tickets to scan and can't do anything with them. it was such a pain to enter codes manually so this app was such a help.. until now.",
      "Just downloaded this app despite all the terrible reviews. App runs crazy slow and won't let me long into my account at all, nor create a new account, so I can't even fin how if it's as terrible at scanning/logging game pieces as everyone says b/c I can't even log in. Need to de-bug this app b/c right now it's trash.",
      "Was hesitant to download the app due to all the bad reviews even though I didn't have a problem last year. So far so good this year too. Had no problem signing on even when my email was autofilled. Had no problem scanning all 42 pieces I have so far.",
      "General a great app for tracking purposes. The redeeming tokens part really needs updating. I literally just got redeem 1 token, continue, and close 200 times. Why? Add a feature to choose how many entries to enter. I'd rather click once than 200 times."

      "I really like it and so far I don't have any problems with it, BUT. I hope they make something like what rave category you would like to watch and by that we don't have to scroll all the way down to get the wanted rave, and that doesn't mean we can actually find the wanted category, oh and another one, I really hope we can invite friends to the rave that we're in or join our friends and message our friends as well. I really hope you make these two happend.",
      "Horrible! Can't even give any stars at all. But they are forcing me to.I attempted several times to download on laptop and all it did was play a stupid video over and over but i could see 1/2 of the screen?? nothing else showed up it felt like it was going to give my computer a virus so I just deleted it off my laptop.",
      "I dont usually review apps but I was pleasantly surprised by this one, everything about it is amazing. I love all the features and everything runs very smoothly. My only concern was the amount of battery it took, otherwise it was great! As a suggestion, it would be great if we had access to music streaming sites like Spotify and YouTube Music. Also an option to choose the videos in advance and putting them in a playlist so that the host wont have to worry about what to play next. Thank you!",
      "The thing is I think this would be a great app but you have to login to your netflix acc and it would never let me log in we even vcontacted netflix but they said everything was fine with the password and everything but rave still wouldnt let me log in and so I could never watch anything with my friend and deleted the app They should fix it where only one person has to login to there acc and add people and everyone could watch if that was fixed i would rate more then 1 star :/ (disapointed).",
      "What the app does, it does very well. Easy to install, easy to watch, easy to invite. But problems with the app are clearly a failure in the design process. There is no help or user's guide, of any kind, anywhere. What do the features mean and how do they work? Nobody knows. What are Kin and how do you earn them? No explanation (or consistency). What does enrolling in premium subscription give you? No idea, even after doing it. I would happily recommend it...once it's finished."

      "On 3/17 I paid for a 3 month introductory offer for 4.99 a month. To this point I have been unable to get on Stars and watch a single show of the only reason I signed up. Every time I try to sign in it gives me a message stating there is already an account under that name. I was on the phone on hold (supposed to be 20 minutes) for over an hour no never receive any answer or assistance. They took my money out for payment. Why can't I log in on my tablet or o my android. It's downloaded ants the problem? Barbara Tamburo",
      "So irritated! I have the app on my phone and smart TV. When I try to play app on my TV it doesn't load completely and when i can finally get to the show I'm looking for it won't load to play now. Been working okay fir a while but now i can't watch anything! So frustrating that I give up! Oh and no closed captioning?! Not cool at all! Please help!",
      "App immediately takes me to create account screen where I'm stuck in a loop. I put in my email and password and of course it says an account already exists with that email. When I try to back out it gives me a message saying I've already paid but if I want to access content I have to input my information. There are no other options on this screen.",
      "The app certainly gets the job done, however it's far from the smoothest experience. It can be difficult to find new things of interest to watch, particularly without proper genre browsing and no recommendations. As well, streaming to a Chromecast is finicky. There's no option to skip intros or recaps and there's no autoplay for watching episodes back to back. Episodes also occasionally start in the wrong language. Hopefully these things will get fixed in the future.",
      "I wish they would give an option to disable autoplay...this is a common feature on streaming apps! At least play videos from my playlist! There's a lot of older content too. I probably won't renew at the end of my subscription period. The app also uses over a gigabyte of storage...why? Netflix uses 212mb. Disney+ uses 345mb, and prime uses 627mb...smh"

      "this app is painful to use. showtime needs to hire a UX designer who actually watches shows from an app. the search field is buried in a menu. If you add a show to your list, it's hard to access the full series so that you can watch/download new shows (you can only do this by finding the search field and searching for the show again). You can't add a series to your list, just individual episodes. When you're starting a new series it lists the episodes in reverse chronological order. I guess this makes sense if you've been watching the whole time and are just looking for new episodes, but for starting a new series (especially since you can only find episodes by starting with the search field), it's annoying to always start with the last season, and then have to scroll all the way to the end to get to the first episodes. wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so hard to get there in the first place. also, it's easy to forget this format (maybe it's just me), so frequently when i start a new series i'm starting with the last episode of the first season. I could go on but why bother. Its nice that you can download shows and watch when you're offline. app gets 1 extra star for that feature.",
      "Crashes every 5 minutes says\"playback interrupted\"Then makes me log in again. Once I sign back in I dont know where I left off, it wont show you either.You have to scroll through each episode to see where you left off. When it finally does play it says loading and lasts for 30 seconds or more every few minutes.The shows are great if you are ever able to actually watch them.Watch it through prime it's so much better, it doesnt crash and when you hit play it picks right back up where you left off.",
      "I am at my wit's end with this app, it says there isn't enough space on my phone to download episodes, despite having a ton of space left on my phone. The app will also randomly sign me out for no reason, and if I back out of the app to check a notification while I'm watching a show, 1 of 2 things happens:1. it actually plays with no errors, exactly where I left off in the show. 2. A playback error occurs and I have to restart the episode. Absolutely ridiculous.",
      "Horrible! Crashes all the time. Constantly buffers. When you come back to a show, it doesn't keep the place your left off. It doesn't even keep track what episode you are on! I have Netflix, hulu, Prime video, HBO and they all work great! Unlike Showtime!!",
      "The layout and the way this app functions needs ALOT of work. It cant even remember what episode you were watching you have to manually search for it and then select it. THEN if you go out of the app for any reason it cancels playback and you have to do the search all over again. Then before you watch anything it asks if you are sure you want to watch without using wifi... EVERY SINGLE TIME."

      "Can't watch after signing in with Directv info. I select Directv as my provider and it automatically signs me in, I don't have to type in the username and password. I think that's odd so maybe why its not working. However it shows the Directv logo in the top right corner of the app as if I'm signed in but I can watch any shows like Operación Pacífico. I need to catch up on a couple episodes, please help.",
      "Great app but needs more episodes in English for non native speakers. English episodes are hard to find and the few shows in English (lady revenge, husband for hire, kidnapped at the club) have been on the app for too long. Time for new ones please.",

If some channels are not available thru the app, that should be noted so there's less frustration. I like using the app on my Chromebook at times and in rooms where I don't have a TV, but what's the use if I can't access the channels I wish to watch that are on my service level?",
      "Beyond horrible. -5 stars. Slow loading. Constant errors of several types. Channels won't load even after cache clean & reboot etc. It's worse after every update. Never gets better. Spectrum sucks but this app is even worse. Can't wait for fiber optic and streaming so I can watch Spectrum burn to the ground. The single worst service and app ever. Just don't!",
      "This app used to work perfect for me. Loved it last year. Until I did the app update it required last month on my phone. Since then this app does NOT WORK at all. I've contacted them to report it, & reinstalled the app. & No results from both. Let's get this app fixed, Spectrum. Or you may lose a customer.",
      "App is garbage. It's constantly freezing and buffering. I have deleted and re downloaded multiple times and I've upgraded as well. It's still trash. Can't seem to even get past the black page that says spectrum. It just freezes rt there constantly Edit march 9th- have deleted and re downloaded numerous times this issue never seems to be fixed. I have 5g and 2g and it happens on both. Edit march 11th- is still not loading. Not a problem with Wi-Fi, using 5g and 2g...when will this issue be fix BS",
      "Where are the DVR features? We just got our Spectrum service installed yesterday and I'm quickly learning about all the shortcomings. There is no whole house DVR option and now looks like this app doesn't provide any DVR capabilities either. I'm used to Comcast service and Spectrum pales in comparison. Glad they offer 30 day money back guarantee because I think I may use it."

      "I would give this app 5 stars, if it let me play it more often. Every time I tap on a pic to color, it says there's a network connection error, even though my phone says the connection strength is excellent. Clicking on \"try again\" doesn't doesn't work even tho I try multiple times. Occasionally it will immediately load the pic and I can color one, but not very often. It's a shame, cuz the pics are amazing and it would prolly be my favorite coloring app (I have 7) if it wasn't for this problem.",
      "It's the best game it has alot of options for coloring pictures you can understand Wie it says adult coloring for some of the pictures but I do wish there weren't so much ads It's really relaxing and if I'm mad all I need to do is color a picture and BOOM back to normal I wish I could play this game all day long and if it's a little bit of a glitch like mine was when I first got the game I got rid of it than got the game agne then it was fine I'm satisfied with the game trust me it's the best❤❤",
      "It wont let me open up too many of the pictures. Black square pops up saying some type of error. Also some other photos lets me watch the video to unlock picture then it says network error or bad internet connection try again. Its a guessing game. Ill watch the videos to unlock and nothing so annoying ads to not color the photo i chose. This app has too many bugs and if not fixed i will delete. Thats why i gave 2 starts. To many malfunctions in this app. Though the photos im able to color great",
      "Ok so this is a update on my last review, If you turn on online this app will work amazingly! But if your looking for a offline drawing app this isn't going to work for you! And they say you can download the pictures and use it offline, but I tried that and it still won't work offline.",
      "I'm honestly disappointed. I read another review saying that you hid some of the things and it almost forces you to have to use hints, I thought, \"surely it can't be that bad\" Oh, no, it is. It's terrible. They didn't even try to cover the fact that they do it, there's a hidden one or multiple hidden for almost ever color. It's ridiculous and annoying. The paintings are pretty though, the only good thing I can say."

Don't waste ur time signing up for the trial, when it asks you, just press back/return to previous page and watch 2 ads. Ur going to have to whether u pay or not. Unsubscribing now and deleting app",
      "BEWARE!!!! Watch out for billing from this app. I enrolled in a 3 day free trial that was supposed to bill $26.99 if not cancelled. I cancelled the trial within 15-20 minutes because the app didn't work for me. Attached to the trial was a 2nd fee for a 1 year service for $96.99, it was not advertised. PayPal and Google have tried to contact the developer to have this issue resolved. It has been over a month and they still will not respond to correct this issue.",
      "😡😤🤬I downloaded this app on Feb 7, 2020 and for some reason I ended up paying for it twice. $25.99 the monthly charge and then again $103.05 for the yrly charge. Both of which came with a 3 day trial that stated you could cancel by Feb 10,2020 and you wouldn't be charged. I tried the app. 1st the palm reader twice and one other. I decided that I wouldn't get my $ worth so I cancelled them both. They already charged my account $103.05 and refused to refund me. I'm PISSED!!! Thieves!!!",
      "ITS A FRAUD. I bought it for my child's birthday, using the 1 yr package for 100 bux. We tried several different things. When we went to scan our faces and hands, but the app kept closing. So we went to log out, but there was no log out button! We searched for half an hour trying to log out, but there is no way to. Everything else closes when u try to take a scan. So we deleted the app, and tried to get a refund. They said they refused, and there was a problem with my son's brand new i pad mini",
      "I downloaded it because I thought it would be fun to try out but then I subscribed of the 3 day free trial and instead of £27 coming out of the bank £46 came out. So I would advise not getting this app. I have also tryed to refund but it kept going refund declined. What a waste of money."

      "Dear Sony, thank you for bringing this to non Sony phones, as this helps with development and helps further your work on it. However, there are some improvements that could be made. You need to make it where you can connect to your PS4 anywhere. Not just on the same network. You'll need an octacore processor to run this smoothly. Quad core doesn't work well enough. Too much lag. Get yourself a powerful phone before you start to use this. Word to the wise.",
      "Remote Play used to work great for me. But now, it doesn't work outside my home network like before. This applies to the PC version of RP as well. I can only remote play within my home Network, which is kinda pointless for my situation. I know it connects to my PS4 pro because it says \"registering\" but when it says \"checking internet connection\" it now always says that it's too slow, which I know that's not true. I have over 200mbps. Anyone else having this issue?",
      "Great for entertainment, but not ideal if your controller battery dies. Also, you used to be able to connect to your PS4 regardless of if you are on the same wifi as it...my review would be 5 stars if you could connect as long as it is able to be reached, but since you have to bee on the same wifi as the PS4, it's 3 stars. (If its changed, my review will change accordingly.)",
      "1. Needs to be functional on mobile data due to the very rare occasions when gamers would actually be able to stand in an actual FREE wifi area. It's just not common to find FREE wifi outdoors. 2. NEEDS TO ALLOW UP TO 4 CONTROLLERS for when using a nice supersized tablet or if connecting a phone hdmi to a TV. This would beat Nintendo switch without trying. Don't you want to beat Nintendo switch right in their face?🙂👍🏽🎮🎮🎮🎮"

      "For the older movies it just loads for forever you can't even click on the play button. If you do click on the play button it doesn't work it flashed the button green? This happens with some movies like clueless, pitch perfect, etc. With a lot of the other movies it says the movie link is broken? I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, it didn't help.(Edit the day after): They took of all the movies I listed and didn't even attempt to fix the problem? So now there's no good movies.",
      "Movie selection is great, but when I search for a movie -- that I know is 100% on this app -- NO results are ever found! Further, when I click on any title to get it's details, and then navigating back to all of the movie listings, I am returned to the very top of the list. Aggravating, because if I've scrolled down far enough during a search, I have to then find where I left off.",
      "Put simply, the list of films on offer is not exhaustive but they are free, so there are no complaints from me on this end. Also, I've had to \"struggle\" with the ads - one before the film started. The only thing I could recommend would be to allow the use of an external video player, like VLC or MX Player, or try to build casting functionality into the inbuilt video player. Otherwise a good little app.",
      "OMG! I never imagined that I would find such an app. It has enough recent movies and it doesn't buffer for long. I was about to give it 10 🌟 when I realized that there are only 5 🌟. Well done developer. But then, is there no way I can Pay or subscribe (just like Netflix), say for a month or more instead of using Wi-Fi or mobile data. I would really love that feature. Thanks once more for this app developer. Cheers.",
      "Very satisfying to easily search, play and cast. Although at times it does pause and disconnect. However I do not believe it is the program itself. All things considered most likely with my internet living in a rural area. Could very well be the program I used to mirror/cast my phone the tv's through Roku. Other than that I would recommend this to anybody interested in watching good quality movies. Quick tip; unless you want the close captions turn it off as soon as the movie starts."

      "I don't get it... I have had Sling for a few years and have never had any issues until recently. Anytime I watch anything it constantly freezes up and goes to the buffer wheel and then it will eventually just black out the screen. This has happened on multiple devices with different internet connections. I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no resolution to the problem. All other streaming apps Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon work great, it's definitely a Sling problem. Hard pass. Do not reco",
      "More updates, sometimes we make it through a commercial break. Even after a couple of updates, now I can't stream at all. Yikes, one awful step backwards. Updated to new version, now some times we can stream past a group of commercials, but basically it has the same problems Chromecasting. Shows constantly go black during commercials while simultaneously jumping to the beginning of the show. It isn't fun watching the beginning of a show over and over with no option to resume.",
      "I really like it. Much better than hulu which I just canceled and half the price. More user friendly! So much easier to record and find shows. My favorite, when my screen times out while paused, when I open it back up it comes on with whatever I was watching and starts playing. With Hulu that would've taken at least 4 more clicks. Only had it a week and I wish I would've changed alot sooner.",
      "Horrible app. I've used this app on my android phone, on Roku TVs and on the Amazon Firetv box. The app crashes and freezes on every device. Customer service says it's my internet connection, which isn't the case. My internet works just fine with a 100mbs signal and I have a full 4G LTE signal on my phone when it malfunctions. And the app is always updated. Time to switch to a different service. I don't recommend this app.",
      "Paid and seen that the same stuff is on Pluto for free. Talked to someone on chat 5 minutes after signing up and no refunds. Now I tried to get on it this morning and its telling me to update my subscription and asking for 30.00 more. Hell no. So at this point I cant watch any thing. Waiting for customer service to open up to ask why and it's also telling me it cant support my tv. Hum rip off scam. No local channels either."

      "While it's convenient to access content on your phone, this app is awful. It's horribly slow, even when doing simple things like bringing up channel listings or episode descriptions. Takes forever to load, and often loses the stream. It's much easier to go through the app or site of a specific network instead. A lot of channels are unavailable when you're not at home, and it doesn't even recognize when you are home. And you can't cast to another device! Way to screw customers over Xfinity!",
      "I do not like the inability to search by channel. If I want to know what is on a specific channel I may have to scroll through hundreds of channels to get the one that I want and then see what is on from there. Instead I would like the ability to type the channel number in the search window and immediately jump to it instead of scrolling.",
      "This app and X1 sucks ass. You won't reconnect my internet modern at home because of this BS not so easy plan. Been without internet for a week. Can't use the Roku app connected via Mobile Hotspot to my phone. Can't pull it up on my phone and mirror it to my TV. Mean while my recordings keep mounting and I can't watch them. Not to mention that the remind and fast forward are horrible as the time moves but not the picture.",
      "Zero Stars! Stinks! Why doesn't this app work as well as NETFLIX ???Now with slightly less lagging, skipping and looping, all at no extra charge, even while in my home and connected to WI FI! Horrible performance! Very, very slow app. constantly looping and skipping! does a great job of providing consistent commercial breaks!! Go Xfinity !!",
      "If your a Xfinity/Comcast user this is a great app. Works great and user friendly has a nice lay out for channels and tv guide. Very helpful these days if only to see current News, weather or sports. It's part of your Tv package you pay for already so why not use it. Many ways you can use at home, camping,vacation,Truck driver etc. just remember to enable data on your phone if not on wifi. I normally don't leave commits on apps but hope this is helpful for everyone. 👍🏼"

      "Same as most other reviews here. App was working fine until about 2 weeks ago, but now is unresponsive. App is not able to connect and control the Dolby Atmos Soundbar I have any more no matter what I do. I must assume it was the latest update that has caused these issues. It does not seem like Vizio cares as they are clearly not responding to these issues on here. Too bad. I'll be returning it to Costco and will never buy Vizio again. Save yourself the headache and buy a quality brand.",
      "Coming from a Roku TV that was more than half the price. This application is unintuitive, hard to navigate and just plain lazyily made. Also casting from your phone doesn't work well, your phone disconnects from the TV making you have to reconnect and lose your spot in whatever you were watching. Ugh.. I won't be buying another Vizio TV, that's for sure.",
      "If you're looking for something to provoke a blind rage, then you've found it in this app and associated soundbar! Features: ALWAYS loses Chromecast connection. Want to cast? You've come to the wrong place! Regularly disappears from your cast options. Want to see lips move on your TV and the sound to come a second later? You've come to the RIGHT place! Want to change outputs via the app? Look forward to watching a blue circular status icon circulate endlessly!!!! FUN FUN FUN 😁",
      "The app no longer changes inputs on my p75-f1 TV. Choosing TV, HDMI-1 or 3 does nothing. It can still turn it off or change channels, so it's communicating, but not able to change inputs any more. I reset the app (clear data), reconnected TV to the Ethernet. It's definitely the app, because \"Remote control for Vizio Smartcast\" app IS able to change inputs.",
      "After pairing both my Visio TVs, this app is rarely able to tell I have one powered on. Turn one on? Has yet to happen once. I'm still amazed with how good the TVs can be and how completely awful the app has been and remains to be. I hoped it would get better, but it looks like they just don't care. I occasionally try to use this every few months, guess what, it still doesn't work. They should probably hire someone who knows what they're doing..."

      "(i recommen a better app to use below) On the add i saw for this app it said you can use it with out wifi, but that is not the case. Plus when i do have wifi it won't load any songs. I will even use my moble data too, but it still doesn't work. Honestly this app is not worth downloading. If you want an app that i think works pretty well i would say Aduiomac is really good. I recommen that app insted off this. This app is not good, but i appreciate the attempt in making a music app. Thank you!",
      "It is not movable to the SD Card which is a must for any app. It was advertised as being a offline music player, however it does seem to have that capability, it did not seem to detect my files. Also, while it is not the fault of the music player, seems to be not exactly what I am looking for which is a simple MP3 player. A lot of online content. Mostly just a run of the mill music player but that SD card issue made my rating lose a star as well as the irregular local file incapability.",
      "This app has adware in it!!! I kept getting annoying add pop ups on my phone, but it does not tell you it is this app. These ads pop up on top of every app I use even when mega music is not open. I finally figured it out by going to the play store and changing my installed apps from \"alphabetical\"to \"most recently used\" every time the add popped up this app would jump to the top of my most recently used apps.",
      "It's definitely one of the better music apps. You don't need to be in the app, basically every song I can think of. And still a really great app without premium. My only complaint is that the ads constantly pop up even if the app isn't up. (I got like 3 ads while wrighting this review)",
      "I got this app to listen to music. Not to have an add pop up every five seconds. When I'm not on Mega Music, an add pops up and it makes me so mad. And when I'm trying to listen to music I can't even play one song because of how long it takes to load. I don't recommend this app.😤"

      "Hi, I have a problem. I used this app for like 3 months and It was fine. But then when I tried to open the app it just said ,,Autodesk Sketchbook keeps stopping.\" And I tried to uninstall it and install it again but that doesnt work either, it was just white screen.. please tell me what to do, I love this app so much and I draw in it every day but now I can't open the app.",

It had another problem with this phone too like random glitching out but I can tolerate it, however I can't tolerate something completely unusable. Please fix the app as soon as possible, thanks!",
      "Definitely my favorite drawing app right now, but have been having an issue for a while now. A lot of my drawings keep on getting corrupted with no way to get them back. I saw that the latest updated added a recovery feature, but after updating its nowhere to be found. Luckily, only my doodles and finished pieces have been corrupted, but I have a lot of WIPs and I'm scared some of them are gonna be corrupted soon (I'm a slow drawer lol). Hope there's a fix soon! (and add clipping layers please!)",
      "My goodness sketchbook never ceases to irritate me. So I can only assume this became a problem with the recent update cause I dont know exactly how long this problem has been going on. All of my sketches except 2 are corrupted or fail to open. I'm thankful that the sketches are saved on my device so they arent lost but i cant open the sketches. I've tried making a copy but that is also corrupt. I've looked through the forums and I cant find anybody with the same problem (at least on mobile)",
      "This gets 0 stars!!! I can't locate the color palette on the top bar - it is just NOT THERE. I've viewed several tutorials, and they all show a palette on the top. I've even clicked on \"support\", and that tutorial shows a palette on top as well. The last version I installed years ago was user friendly. This one is not."

I can't use my cards to pay anymore because it always says my address with my bank is always wrong. This is the perfect time to use the app for psn cards but I can't and it's beyond frustrating. Please fix this if you can.",
      "Literally the worst app. I can never purchase anything as it always gives an error when inputting my info. Sometimes the cart just randomly deletes what I put in it. Anyways I've been trying for months. The sad thing is, is this app has always been like this. Anytime they update for bug issues it dosen't fix anything. Even their website is extremely flawed. Definitely sucks since I have a gamestop credit card and can't even use it and always end up ordering from amazon.",
      "When I first got this app I loved it. But recently it's not updating the inventory on certain items (mainly collectables) so as we sit right now it says there is not 1 marvel legends or black series fig in a gamestop within 25miles...... and that's not true. Also takes forever to load. Hopefully gamestop just dies soon so we dont have to be disappointed in everything they do.",
      "Y'all need to really fix or rework the app because geez it is really bad... below are just some issues but c'mon guys. 1) constant errors, pretty random most of the time 2) needs to display ALL preorders 3) shouldn't have to be redirected to a browser, anything should be done through the app 4) none of the \"bug fixes\" seem to be working 5) make an account in the store, never get an email to setup account",
      "The features and functionality of this app seem to deteriorate as time goes on and what it has ended up as now is a barely functioning website basically. Not all of your pre-orders show up, the amount left to pay isn't there, it won't be able to remember where you put your location as, it will sporadically log you out and force you to log back in multiple times. The list goes on. If it ever worked properly again, the app would be great. But at this point I don't see that happening."

      "Love these videos, would be nice if this app could be put on sd card though, downloading these videos will use up a whole bunch of internal storage!!! A lot of conjecture of the biblical characters lives, but love the way they are portrayed, especially Jesus Christ. Very well done. Thank you very much Vidangel! God bless the creators of this series, and all envolved. Looking forward to season 2! This is well worth donating to.",
      "Well done! The series is shockingly intriguing. My husband and i laughed that we were on the edge of our seats even tho we know the stories and the ending. Ha!! Excellent content and production! BUT a bit too dark on the monitor and tv...and a little quiet for people with slight hearing impairment that usually don't have issues.",
      "I love this portrayal of Jesus. Very well done. The app is simple and easy to use, although I've been having trouble trying to enable the subtitles in the TV. In the app works fine but once I start broadcasting it doesn't show the option in the TV for audio or subtitles, and I can't control it on the app once it starts streaming. Besides that, everything else is great.",
      "As an app, it's very straightforward and the \"pay it forward\" model of financing the app is a genius way of doing something new as mentioned in Isaiah. It's an act generosity and I pray blessings to these people paying for us to view the episodes. The multi-platform viewing is also very well executed, I was able to view the videos in our projector during Bible Study. Everyone was and is still blessed. As a show, it's very thought provoking and made me want to read the Gospels in a deeper level.",
      "It is an amazing experience. For some reason mine keeps buffering every few minutes which can make it very frustrating. But I think that might be due to my own internet connection. The movies however are fantastic - moving and touch the spirit and soul. I think the team from this app have captured the spirit of Jesus so well. If you doubt Jesus loves you or that he is the best person to ever have lived you should take time to watch. And feel your Spirit cry out in yearning for Creator God."

      "I hate this app and this can die in a whole!! Gosh im sorry for being mean. Its just the ads! Everytime i wanna draw something a ad comes up. I would be even fine if it wouldnt be Tomb of the mask IN EVERY SINGLE AD! I like the app, i would give it a 5 star but it totally dissapointed me.",
      "This game is so fun because you can do different thing to color and i love this because i like to paint thing.",
      "This is a relaxing game with loads of stuff to choose from. My advice would be to turn off your wifi or data if you don't want ads at all.",
      "This is a very fun game. But if you already did one color and you accidentally colored with a different color, you will have to go back and color it again. When you color in a spot that isn't supposed to be colored, you will have to go back and erase it. If you want to make the squares a different shape, for example, stars, you can only see it in stars and see the video of the creation being made, but you cannot change it. Other than that, it is a really great game."

The video eventually unfreezes but then it freezes again within a minute. Please fix thiis ASAP. Casting Hulu from my phone to the Mi Box S works but that's only a temporary solution.",
      "hulu android tv app is trash. Plays for 5 second then video pauses, then picks up again about 3 second later, repeated. The ausio plays fine the whole time. Worked fine for the first month then after Andriod tv update never worked again. Called hulu support , they attempted to blame my ISP (even though all other services worked including their parent companies Disney+). We discussed how if they wanted to do that I would need to conference call my ISP on the line and they moved on to blaming my router. When through resetting router and cable modem. Then moved on to blaming my device (a mii box s) repeatedly and referencing their own and confirming it was a supported device (kept saying it was a supported device but was older, but was supported, but was older). Repeatedly denied that the hulu app was the problem about 3 times until admitting it was and that the tech team was working on a fix. Gave a week service discount. Support call was an hour of chat and 3 hours of phone conversation about excuses and non-sense. It has been a month, no emails, no fixes, same issue. With the CEO stepping down maybe they will clean up there act, the Disney + works flawlessly...",
      "Like every other recent user has stated, this app is useless. Biggest problem seems to be on demand playback. Can barely watch before video freezes and audio continues. If I watch on my tablet in browser and cast it to device no issue. So that points to this app being the issue and not my ISP. Hard to believe Hulu hasn't done anything to fix this considering the number of similar complaints recently.",
      "Simply doesn't work right and hasn't for a LONG time. Video stops but audio continues, etc. All of the problems are well documented here but not fixed after too long.",
      "Have three Android TVs (Sony) and it runs on all of them with only minor glitches/freezing. However the app is super slow and really bogs down my TV performance with lots of lag to change volume and pull up the guide."

      "This has the new Nickelodeon shows. But it doesn't have the old shows. It's a waste of space on my phone, and it doesn't even have the classic shows. Like Rugrat's, Avatar, icarly and TMNT 2012 it's just the new stuff. It's could be great!!! If it had all the shows in one spot. But it's only the new ones and most popular ones. Which makes sense but also drives off some hardcore Nickelodeon fans.",
      "Terrible app. Bad UI that requires lots of swiping (I don't know why it doesn't use the grid view by default) EXTREME lack of shows, half of which are Nick Jr. shows, even though there's a separate app, no older shows, disappointed that I couldn't even find I am Frankie (and the show's not even that old) and overall just a terrible experience. The nick app used to be so much better. What happened???",
      "Update: After last Tmobile update the app never works. Always says my connection is too slow for video. It works sometimes. Sometimes it doesnt. The shows also have commercials which is not a huge deal but you have to use your cable info. So Im kinda paying twice. Also cant get it on my windows computer so the only place the app is functional is on my phone.",
      "I want where you can play games on the app again. I tried going to the Nick website but you can't play all you can do is download if you want to play. And it doesn't have any of my favorites games anymore. I don't know what made you think that getting rid of the games would get more people to install it. I would RATR 0 STAR IF I COULD. I HATE THIS APPPPPPP!!!!!!!! ಠ︵ಠ 🤬😠👿",
      "I love Nickelodeon shows and when i seen the app I was so excited to use it. I open the app and there were not that many good shows on there. Plus the app description says there are way more shows on the app then there is. Also that fact that you have to use a tv provider is not fair to those who cant afford cable. I tried to use my tv provider which is spectrum and it only allowed we to watch the first episode of SOME OF THE SHOWS that was on the app. I dont think this app is worth downloading"

It was at one point an extremely efficient way to look up movies and actors, to see what critics had to say about them, and to run through upcoming trailers.

I have to search for any movie I want to watch, even if I added it to my list, because I can't view my list. Also buffers a lot, and I frequently have to switch out and back in to the app to make it resume. Desktop site works well. Love Shudder. Frustrated by the app.",
      "This app is terrible. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times and it still won't load/ play the movie. It freezes after several seconds and only the audio will continue. Sometimes not even that. I've tried my Wi-Fi. I've tried my unlimited data on my tablet. Nothing is working. I'm very disappointed. I was looking forward to being a paying member. At this rate, I won't proceed past the trial. Please fix your app.",
      "I saw an add for The Room. It was why I signed up for the free trial. Decent app, no lag or freezing issues. However what video streaming app doesn't support casting these days? If it supported casting to my TV, then I'd give 5 stars and would pay for the subscription I think.",
      "Can't watch on tablet which is pretty awful when the site forces you to download the app in order to stream. As others have mentioned the app doesn't allow you to login (states that your login information is incorrect). Please fix!",
      "Works now. I think it is just the internet keeps turning off every so often. I just keep turning it back on, I can deal i guess, if that's the case, for the time being."

      "Great functionality if you're looking for a way to manage your game library when you need to install a game from a place other than your home I guess. It also allows you to finish Game Pass Quests which is useful because I never bring that up on my console. It's too well hidden to ever remember. It's useful, but in no way innovative or a game changer.",
      "Not sure if people are misreading it or what. But it's still 1k points for the quest completionist. And still a ton of points to earn. Also, why are we judging an app off a program that just supports the app, not the app itself which works perfectly? I hate on Microsoft as much as the next guy. But darn if they haven't started to become very consumer friendly. They may just win me over back from Playstation. Who isn't as much anymore.",
      "Great app, decent service. Only niggle is that you never know in advance how long you have to play something until it's gone. I'm a father of young children so I can only dip in and out of gaming when I've time. I have a few games on my list to get through, but sadly some are now gone from XGP. It would be nice if I knew when a game is going to be removed so I can prioritize it first. Otherwise it would be a 5-star review, easily.",
      "Very handy app, I can access my acciunt & take care of what ever it is I wont to do all with ease of access & not having to turn on both my tv & console. I imagine this app will only improve over time. Hence I recommend giving feedback as opposed to critical complaining. Things can only improve if as a community we help Microsoft help us by way of constructive feedback.",
      "It works. I'll update my rating if it stops doing so. But until then, well done Microsoft. Update: A huge part of the draw of the Game Pass app was participating and tracking Quests. Microsoft has ruined Quests now. They advertised in February that they were \"launching a massive update to Xbox Game Pass Quests giving you more Quests, more ways to earn, and more points.\" Total possible points in February? Approx 3,730 After the unannounced change in March? 885 I won't be using the app anymore."

      "The overwhelming majority of the time I try to use the app I get stuck with the popup saying the TV must be turned on the use this app. I wouldn't mind this if the tv was off for obvious reasons, but when I'm actively watching something on said TV and can not navigate past the popup until the TV is \"turned on\". I wonder why I keep trying the same thing over and over again expecting a different result.",
      "I love the concept, but the implementation is extremely poor. For example, if my phone locks or if I switch to a different app, I have to search for the TV again! Sometimes the app picks up the TV, sometimes it doesn't, very unreliable! The most annoying bit is the volume control, I don't understand why I can't use my hardware volume buttons to control it? It's is so obvious and other apps such as sonos and bose have this feature. Finally what about security, no auth to control the TV?",
      "It has the potential to be good, but misses on some quality of life features. My experience is smooth, no hiccups connecting to LG C9 and LG SM86 with my Samsung Note 4, but my main gripe is the inability to save TVs, you can only turn on the last TV you connected to. The remotes that came with the TVs, turn on the TVs via infra-red which isn't reliable in my environment, so the inability to turn on both TVs with WiFi would've been invaluable, but unfortunately, is not supported.",
      "Disappointed. At first this app seemed to work brilliantly, a much needed stop gap after dropping the actual remote in water, unfortunately it kept on pausing the tv. I didn't seem to matter if it was live tv or Netflix/ Amazon, every few minutes it would pause play for a minute. Possibly a slight compatibility issue with my Samsung A40 phone??? Point is I'm purchasing a new physical remote away.",
      "Honestly the next best option besides using the actual remote. Pros: 1) Controls are easy to use and understand. 2) No legs 3) No need to look for the remote anymore 4) Has the option of a touch screen, easier to use it as a mouse instead of the arrows on the actual remote. 5) Has voice commanda for the LG TV smart, incase you get stuck with the traditional remote. Cons: 1) Wish a new update can make users customize the virtual remote themes."

The free trial is only good for one week wast of money if you ask me. There are no adds. I only recommend this app if you like a terrible app and unfair deals. If you download this app your not going to be having a good time unless you spend $69.00 plus tax.",
      "Worst app ever first of all the app picks a story for you. After it picks that story for you you can't look at the pictures, go to the next chapter, or read a different one. You have to have a membership that is $69.99 per year. How dumb do you have to be to pay that much for fake texts when there is something on snapchat that does the same thing for free. Would rate it zero stars if I could.",
      "It only let's you read one episode and then you have to pay for the rest. This app is a waste of time, I think the story's could be good but not worth the money. I hope they can fix this otherwise no one will download this app. Do not download this app, in my opinion it's really not worth it.",
      "The reason why i gave two stars is because the app was really fun while the free trial was going on but as soon as i cancled because im not paying 70$ for a stupid game it didnt work at all not worth the trouble of installing and uninstalling why have a 'free' app if its not really free",
      "I HATE IT no wonder this app has bad ratings you cant even finish the whole season it's so BAD I absolutely hate it.. sooo let me get this straight you clearly want money and dont care about us!?!?!?! 1 STAR and if there was a rating that you had the choice to pick no stars THAT WOULD BE YOU STUPID \"YARN\" I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT"

      "Love using the app then pick up is a breeze! I even use it to browse from my car and decide, because it's much easier to do when u don't feel rushed, then pay in the app and walk up to the box and push pick up on the screen and slide my card for verification and it may ask a question but other than that it grabs my movie(s) and I am on to the next errand.",
      "The app is okay, here's my frustration: Redbox sends an email with a promo & a button to \"Rent Now.\" Yet when I place items in my cart & go to checkout, I have to manually go back to the email, find the promo code and type it in. When I link through the email, the promo should already populate with an option to use it or points. This would be 5 stars if that was available.",
      "Normally I love this app but all of a sudden it won't let me add any movies to my wishlist and the movies that were on my wishlist are gone now. I hope this issue gets fixed soon. Here it is March 3 months later and it's doing the same thing again!! I'm so tired of it I think I'm just going to delete the app and use my VUDU app which NEVER has these kind of problems! Tried contacting then via the provided website but it won't load and says the page can't be reached...🙄",
      "Almost flawless. I say almost because there have been times when there were purchasing issues or rather glitches with the system. Once I was awarded a free movie code with no expiration date, but when I tried the code it read expired. Redbox will usually make it up to you with an equivalent.",
      "Mobile app always has some weird quirk that makes it difficult to work with. Addl info: I selected a DVD at a certain location & then realized it was wrong location. I backed out/ removed from cart; but every time I went back to re select, it showed up in the SAME Redbox kiosk. No matter what i tried I couldn't get it to let me choose another location. Finally, I completely exited from Redbox app and had to re login and it then let me choose another pickup location. Very frustrating."

      "This company has sold me a video with a known bug in it. Once I discovered the bug, which takes place in the middle of the game, I asked for a refund, giving the fact that the product was defective. Because it was deep into the game and took me over 17 hours to find it, Steam refused my refund. I researched their own site where this game, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent, is discussed in forums about the exact bug I wanted a refund for!",
      "horrible wont let me log in. numbers flashing at the bottom of the screen, wont let me change my password, because you have to leave the app to go through the four steps of verification and as soon as you do you have to go back to the beginning. I just wanted to check on a game im waiting to buy. just horrible. it is only an app that sells games for PC why is it so difficult to log in.",
      "Works Ok. But REALLY needs to fix bugs. It's still faster and easier to log into steam on chrome than trying to use the app for the store or library. When I watch store videos, I'll press the full screen button and the app just freezes until I tap the screen again. Nothing gets bigger, there's no way to make the video bigger, aside from landscape and that cuts off the top or bottom... I don't have these problems when use the website on chrome while on this same phone. Please Valve, Fix.",
      "I thought I'd be able to play games through Steam here on my android but it appears not. I read the snide remarks on the forum where someone asked about this and so please don't post them here. I can play this particular game via Kongregate so i was \"assuming\" I could have also done it with Steam. Fingers un-crossed - not what I was expecting. :D",
      "I like steam and the app works as expected but this is the only place I can find to post a review and maybe be heard. Downloading games is inconsistent at best I'll have spikes where I get good speeds followed by an equal amount of time where it completely stops. And they force the updates before you can launch the game so if you're playing a game like ark especially when running mods you cant connect to a server that hasn't been updated"

      "Impossible to watch past streams of anyone due to the buffering speeds. I'll get 5-6 seconds of footage and then roughly 15-20 seconds of load times. (Not an exaggeration, I timed it with a stopwatch.) This is with average internet speeds in my home of 10-20 Mbps. Not blistering, but Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, et al can stream at 1080 with no latency with roughly 5 Mbps or less IIRC. Please fix this.",
      "Everything runs smoothly for me. No crashes at all. If my internet acts up, obviously there's going to be a small time of buffering. Only thing I would love if they added is a ten second rewind or forward button when watching past streams. It's so hard trying to skip forward from an intro or to go back to see a gameplay using the scroll bar.",
      "My number 1 entertainment app. One thing i would love to have is to be able to sub via my phone. It is added effort to take out ones laptop or switch on our computers when we are already on mixer on our phones. To be honest i would sub allot more if i had the access on my phone app. Thank you still for all the effort and hard work! This is still an amazing platform and team!!",
      "New update. New UI. New layout. Still broken. Audio only mode stuck in buffering. Can't even follow stream because service is terrible and now I can't hear it either. Chat times out often. Screen freezes often. Streaming to mobile has not been streamlined. It's horrible unless on WiFi.",
      "UX not good enough for when streaming on XB1 🎧. Should make it all much quicker & easier to accompany xboxone streamers. eg. When I'm streaming on xb1, my android mixer app shouldn't ask me if I want to start streaming. It should instead recognise I'm streaming and ask me if I'd like to see my viewers and to message with them etc., or, to share to twitter etc! 😒😝 UPDATE 20th March 2020: still poor UX for above reasons."

Well in my house I found 2 gohsts that are really nice, I forgot their name, but yea they were both a girl and really sweet! But there is something wrong with it, the thing wrong with it is that they don't let you pick your own question so I'm thinking it's fake. If you fix that mistake 100 stars!!!",

      "It's fake, and it looks through your files without consent, I checked the background permissions it has and it even has contacts and Facebook activity. I looked over the code and it showed a line of code that makes it so you can't find a ghost unless you purchase the \"pro version.\" Long story short, your phone doesn't have the capabilities to detect ghosts, you would need special sensors. It's fine if you got it has a joke, but if you think it's real, sorry but it's not.",

After somometime using This app now, seems that it needs to be fixed.. when episodes are full it will later stop during watching and say its not availabe anymore. Edit; just downloaded on new device where is team Umizoomi, Wally kazam and others are missing ????and my kid loved those. Uninstalling!!",
      "Nothing works on the app anymore. Worked fine for a while, but now it keeps saying\"what youre looking for isnt here anymore, try something else instead\" but it says that for almost everything in the app. Its frustrating because my toddler really loved this app. And it was the only kid friendly app that is free and educational.",
      "I love the app and so does me children, but I'm trying to figure out why they can't watch live TV on their tablets but I can turn it on off my phone. Everything is logged into our service provider so I'm not sure what's making the difference. I'm not sure if it's because their tablets are Androids and my phone is a iPhone. I just want them to get all the benefits from this app since they love it so much. 😁",
      "I didn't actually use the app, since I downloaded it purely to cast the videos to my tv via google chromecast for my 3 year old, and there is no casting option.",

      "I just downloaded this abc app a couple hours ago on my Hydrogen Red and so far it's working perfectly. I've paused a few times and switched between 'windows'. The program I'm watching remained and is playing smoothly even with commercials. Granted, I would rather the commercials be at the end so I can enjoy the commercials and the show without interruptions. I do enjoy commercials just not during my show. I love the ability to access and engage in the programs I'm so fond of. Thank You",
      "Love the shows but the app stinks. It never starts up where the episode left off. Will \"play\" ads but not show them and when the show comes back on its further into the episode than it should be. I'm constantly having to go out and come back in and guess the closest spot to play episode again without triggering the ads again. Even though I have to do that with EVERY commercial break. Its extremely frustrating.",
      "It used to work fine. Since Jan/Feb 2020 it's been acting up. Telling me my area is not supported when I'm in Cali. I've restarted the app, my phone, and /or reinstalled the app sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. And yes, I did send an email through the app for help and it still not working.",
      "Not impressed with this app at all. Abc is one of the biggest networks but you can't even watch live TV on the app (at least in my area). It also often is difficult with watching shows, if you try to skip to a certain spot it always starts you at the beginning of the segment all over again. There's also many times errors that come up when I try to watch something.",
      "I hate the new update. You took away the news when we needed to hear it the most. You forced everyone to update. And did not give us the option to choose what we wanted to watch!!! You've given us more advertisements and less shows to watch and no way to get back what we once had before the so called update."

I love the fact that if there's something in particular you can't find, you can request it. It's simple to use too! You can pick where you want to use the sound/song right from the app. I really love this app. I actually highly recommend it. I used Zedge for years but this app out does Zedge as far as songs/sounds go! Has great potential!",

      "OMGGGG!! This app is literally the best thing that's ever happened to me. I've never been so excited to get a phone call and sometimes (ok, maybe all the time) I get so distracted with the song that I don't answer the call! But overall this app has a HUUUGE variety of songs and it always just knows which part of the song sounds best. Will definetely recommend this app to my friends!

Being able to set a recording as a phone ringtone or notification sound within the app itself is also a neat feature. And it doesn't ask for any permissions it doesn't need to do its job.",
      "It's fun to play with and make various voice soun effects. You can record your own voice and apply the various voice effects or type out a text and apply the voice effects to the text to voice. You also have the ability to share or save the voice recording or text to voice . It's a good app, would recommend this app to anyone. The app is free and isn't bogged down with too many advertisements. The developers of this app did not inject a buncha stupidness in this app. It is on my approved list.",
      "everything really works great. i had a lot of fun trying out the different options and all the available settings. the text to voice works better then most other apps ive tried and the keyboard is a nice touch. having the option to save and import audio clips is entertaining. i paid the $2.99 to remove ads and support the developer. - Android 10",
      "I love this app!! JUST DOWNLOAD IT!! It is soo amazing and soo fun. But the reason why i rate this app 3 stars is because the ads, when i play my recorded things the ads pop up and when i record my voice, it gets ÇØRRÖÚPTĒD please fix that. Guys just download it.... I have fun with the piano that i can create some Monster Sounds and it is very cool that you can even record the sounds from text! This is my No. 2 app. I just love it",
      "Hi review this very good because it changes your voice is very good for boys I think serious has I think it's should be good for boys acting I mean for voice acting sorry right now I'm going to be using this app and one day my kids will be like what was your story and I would say that did that. That I wrote this review ants tended and then my kids would want to use this app and then they'll make a good review like this but right now I'm 7 years old and would turn 8 years old soon"

      "Love Plex! I've set it up for myself and others. Bought the lifetime access. I wish they would bring back being able to pull the video from a cloud service like Google Drive or Dropbox. Otherwise, works great and rarely have any issues. Able to access my library wherever I have a good connection. Looking forward to more great things coming from Plex.",
      "Great app confusing choices in design. Why can't you manually change anything? Why does it all have to be automated meaning you have to learn how it thinks first in order for it to automate corrdctly? I don't know. Seems needlessly complicated however once you figure it out it's a really cool system overall. I'm worried at some point I will have more issues but for the time being I've figured out most of the quirks so this app is really cool right now.",
      "If I had dollar for every minute I'd spent troubleshooting Plex over the course of the years trying to get it to work, I'd have enough to build my own app to replace this stunningly unreliable application. As mentioned in other reviews, it's a lottery as to whether updates break or fix problems, and break something else. Please stop releasing junk on to people.",
      "Very easy setup. Very easy to navigate and I wish I would have taken this leap earlier. I can seamlessly watch videos, shows, listen to podcasts and music on all my devices with no effort in worrying about formats for each platform. I have a roku TV, couple fire sticks, windows laptop, ubuntu laptop, Xbox and iPhone on my network. All content works on all devices. Great product!",
      "I played with Plex since it was recommended by friends after i got a TV with built in Roku. Works great for me. Easy to set up my library even though i had to rename hundreds of movies. I like it, works for me, no issues encountered. The metadata can use some work. Movies and show with names same as older shows will show incorrect metadata at times."

      "Horrible app you have right here. I mean what the heck is up with 35 seconds long ads very 10 seconds. How the heck are we supposed to use the app if that keeps happening?! Your platform is also poorly designed for navigation...stupid app doesn't even save faces and I have to start frm scratch again....again, stupid app doesn't even allow me to save my edited videos...What the heck?!!! Rubbish!",
      "I think that starting with the app to lead you to a way to sign into a subscription immediately seems pretty scammy... was able to figure out how to get past the subscription portion, but app doesnt work if you use gallery photo. Bounding box for face changes after you tap save, so app doesnt work and tries to scam you into a subscription before you find out.",
      "What an awful app. Nothing functions properly, im not one to write reviews but this is just too bad. I saw an add and tried cheering up my friend by making a funny video with the app. I opened the app and suprise 30 ad. I closed the ad and as soon as I pressed the photo button more ads the servers take for ever to load anything and was stuck at loading screens for over 10 minutes god forbid I accidentally hit the screen and get more ad spam when I did get the app to work i couldn't even share it",
      "Need to pay in order to actually use the app. It would be a great app if this wasn't the case. Fix this please. Might I also add, what you're doing is false advertising as you don't explicitly say in the description that you need to pay just to have the \"free\" Trial. Thank you devs for wasting my time.",
      "When you go to crop an image of a friend the outlined selfie placement thing moves a little up and to the right after yhe photo has been taken.. very disappointed with that as that is the main feature of this app... why i gave 2 stars was because well 1. That problem and 2. Other than that its an okay app, its a little laggy also.. but for €10.99 a month its definitely not worth it. I hope you can fix this issue, thanks! J."

      "It doesnt give me a chance to use the cross-Hairs in-game it just disappears! I cant use it with COD (Call Of Duty Mobile) It makes my game a lot slower and the overlay doesnt stay on the screen I tried pressing the icon to bring up the HUD but it just disappears of the screen so i cant use anything!",
      "Bigfoot is great for clash of clans and call of duty, but the icon keeps glitching out and back into my screen. So, basically, almost every time i try to use the overlay it turns the overlay off and whatever im looking for has to be searched for again and again, it happens way too often and focusing on my experience with the app, needs to have a better overlay than the one we have right now. Another thing: Sometimes the overlay screen stretches and it makes the pictures look messed up. Thanks.",
      "The app is glitchy and continuously crashes and slows down my game..once it crashes it opens back up on its own and then freezes my game in the process... please fix this app and I'll change my opinion. Thank you and have a nice day.",
      "In my opinion, if a game assisting app slows down your gaming ability this bad it's a failure. I'm using a OnePlus 7 Pro with a Qualcomm Snap dragon 855 processor and 12 GB of RAM with Fnatic gaming mode and ram booster, it shouldn't slow me down. Takeaway how slow and glitchy it makes playing call of duty and this would be one of the best apps ever but...",
      "Ive had this app since there was only 10,000 people using it and now there 1 Million! It's a great app it is still so underappreciated people dont really know how to work the app so they give the app a bad rating. Bigfoot is a good app and it's so easy to use if you use common sense. It works super good for clash of clans! It takes a couple clicks and youve got yourself a new base! It also works super well on all the other apps. So anyone reading this this is a very useful app you wont regret it"

      "Amazing, this app is a part of my daily routine. My daily routine starts off with my alarm, which is the \"red army\" anthem, after I'm happy after listening to it, I drink a cup of coffee while watching my cat and dog eat the same hamster food. Then, I load my AK47 and head out for work while listening to \"EARBLAST\". I come back to get ready for gym, then I go to gym, come back home and listen to \"flute version\" as I drift off to sleep.",
      "Best app I've ever owned. Nine minutes into using this app I could feel the urge to drive a tank down the street to my local convenience store. I ran to my wardrobe and assembled the most majestic black and white Adidas track suit to have ever been worn by a mortal. While I was running to nearest army base for a tank, I ran across a bear and the two of us made on our merry way, passing a shining bottle of Smirnoff back and forth between us. Jicken sammichs for everybody!!!!!!!!",

      "This is my second review, the other was deleted & not by me! Very disappointed, you get to view 1 movie, intermittently, then forced to upgrade to remove adverts, because adverts stop the other films loading. It kept disconnecting from Chromecast. Mediocre films & not many to choose from.",
      "This app is useless. Every time I trieded to select a movie it never played. The ads always played, so I guess the app's getting something from each failed attempt to watch a movie... Ad revenue! Deleted this app after writing this review - save yourself the trouble and don't bother.",
      "Rather a nice App. Seems to work very well. Could certainly do with more Hedy Lamarr films though. The reason for a 4 rather than a 5 is that it doesn't work on Android 4.x meaning my smart projector (and a lot of Android boxes) are sadly locked out.",
      "Old movies is really enjoyable. I really like that I can Chromecast it too. The only annoyance is that there are many ads. Hoping there can be an ad free version in the near future?",
      "After some initial difficulties in getting the ads removed on two devices, (which has now been resolved), I can say that this is a brilliant app for anyone who loves old movies."

      "Fantastic library but a terrible UI and poor design make finding anything unnecessarily difficult. Everything is buried under confusing arbitrary menus and frequent crashes and connection issues are frustrating. I'm not sure how they even put out such a poorly designed app in this day and age. Other than being a messy cluttered unorganized disaster the comics themselves look amazing and the panels are easy to navigate. Edited to one star because the download function doesn't even work.",
      "This app eats through data like krazy. Even with streaming and downloads set to SD, the app just chewed through 12GB's of data in the last 5 hours. Plus the downloads don't even work. Anything I download won't play after the first few minutes, it'll just stop playing, and the support page I'm sent to isn't any help at all. Really wish they would fix this app.",
      "It's a great app, but the search engine and browser categories could be better. Seem like they remove some of the movies. I feel like all the movies and animated series should be at my disposal. Paying $75/year, the app should be much more better than what it is.",
      "Not easily able to get in and out of even though do not seem to be able to get that to or access to somewhat of a disappointment seeing how the payments are always paid the mailing address in the person is denied so who is paying for itI noticed comic books or regular kept up on this app even on my television I like that I also like the fact that I get to see the cartoons they don't seem to be kept up-to-datebut other and being unable to get in and out of I don't mind I'll 3 stars out of five",
      "I was very disappointed to see the lack of DC animation movies. They have some but nowhere near of what's in their library. I subscribed to watch Harley Quinn, which was great, but not being able to watch the recent JL animation movies that came out in the last 10 years made me unsubscribe."

      "I know it took a lot of time to make tha app, but it would be nice if you could have every squishy and color without paying 99 cents. Also, it sounds like slime in slime games when you squish it. And plz make it so you can turn ur squishy all the way back and down and see all the squishy. But is so satisfying. It rises about as slow as a normal squishy. Cute and fun. Plz make the few fixes and i will change to five stars and change my review.",
      "me and my friend love this app because the squishies are so cute and realistict! They squish really well and are very 3d and entertaining. They have all sorts of different squishy options to choose from! You have so much say over what the squishes are, and look like. I seriously recommed you download this app! It will change your life! And it is really fun!",
      "What can I say! This game is soo amazing! The effort and everything! The animals are cute and the colours are perfect,and the sound when you squeeze them is so relaxing you could fall asleep to it 😌😂. Please add another selection of animals that would be great. The colours are so pretty too, they look like edited RAINBOWS! Here is some animals and colours to add. Giraffe,Parrot,Beige and,Peach. Hope you add em! Bye!",
      "There is only 1 kind of squishy and they all make the same sounds maybe if there were more details I would like this app there are no mini games based on squishes and you do the same thing over and over again and if I could I would rate this a 0 star",
      "It's really good but you should add more stuff to it and add back round music and not have to pay for certain animals besides that it's amazing I could play this forever and ever and the squish nose is so satisfying highly recommend even tho it's 4 stars it's amazing😌✌"

      "So I really gave it a shot, and it was not a good experience by far. Quick survey's are no such thing, they have survey within a survey, then when you do get done it goes to another survey. I did quite a few of them a did not receive any money for. I played games and you only get points to spin a wheel. So this means they are not telling the truth when they say play games for cash. Same with t.v. Thanks for your time!",
      "The app works fine in general, but the two most recent major updates have rendered the arcade unplayable. The interposition of ads was understandable, but the 30 seconds does not always start quickly. The most recent update now tells you to rotate your screen to portrait mode even when it is already there. Nothing seems to bring it away from this message.",
      "Most of the surveys will ask you about 10 questions, and then all if a sudden say you don't qualify, so that's more than a little annoying. When you download an app and play it, don't hold your breath on getting the money for reaching the level (it's been 3 weeks or more for me and they have yet to credit my account) I like the arcade games, but they need more. And the new way if watching commercials basically with a few videos, it sucks. It's annoying.",
      "The first time I did the scratch off, I was super excited because I won $5. The $5 never went to my earnings. I spent hours on a game (Final Fantasy) to get to 100,000 power points to get $15. I have never gotten credited for that either. After the $5 scratch that I never got in my account, the scratches are all just like 8 or 5 cents. I've never even gotten a $1. Which I mean okay free money, I can't really complain about the low amounts, except they hype it up like you'll win a lot.",
      "The layout is cluttered. There's no way to update my profile to reflect my current life and to better my survey options. Then there's the fact that every time I try to watch a video a Telemundo webpage comes up with a frozen countdown timer, no way to back out, and then it asks me what i think of the video THAT I COULDN'T WATCH. This app is a mess!"

From the satellite TV to the app. Nothing works right. I have to unplug the swm power supply every other day or I get a 775 error. No one to come out and look at it either. This is before Corona shut everything down, I'm just now getting around to posting about it. If I had any other option for tv or internet I'd change in a heartbeat.",
      "Crashes all the time. If you have to pause and minimize to do something else, you need to log back in. DVR lets you fast forward commercials but on the app you have to watch the same 4 commercials over and over until you want to throw your device against a wall. When the app crashes every few minutes you have to watch from wherever the app feels like starting your show from and you cannot skip to where you were. There are like a BILLION sports channels! What the heck????",
      "It use to be a good app, but now the app is out of sync with the voice. Also, just like everyone else, I can be in the middle of watching a show and it freezes!!! I force stop the app, clear cache, clear data, and restart my phone. It only fixes the issue for about 20mins, then I have to do the process all over again. I've had to download other tv apps to watch my favorite shows because of this problem. New update to fix this, please!!! Ugh!!!",
      "Slow slow slow. Slow startup. Slow navigation. Slow response. Slow authentication. \"Cannot play content at this time\". \"Network error\" \"Unable to authenticate \" and other errors happen randomly then go away on a subsequent try, or after forcing the app to close and restarting it. My home network is rock solid and no other app has issues. Clearly the QA process is severely lacking. This app is a major disappointment.",

      "Terrible. Everytime I try to use the app it force closes, doesn't start or am hit with service errors. Have most streaming services and this app is by far the worst of them all. When you finally get to watch something and start getting into it, it'll crash. I've seen free streaming services that operate far better than this, the fact I've been a paying customer for so long really irritates me.",
      "Not only did I have to change my user code twice with this app, I had to do it a third time after. After that when it still denied me access I rebooted for a forth time. Then when I finally got it, I can barely watch anything, it has to think every half a minute. So getting it was an waste of time if I cant watch a show. They'll do nothing about it regardless.",
      "The drop-down buttons and casting do not work properly. I cant play or pause without opening and navigating to the specific show/movie being played. Defeats the purpose. And hours later, the drop down will still be there when not connected and no way to get rid of it. Volume controls do not work either when casting.",
      "this has to be the worst streaming app of all time. first I have issues logging which I have to go to my settings to clear all my data to fix. next when I get that settled I try to connect to my chromecast which again does not work. I tried all my other streaming apps to see if it was the chromecast and it was not. they spend 15 million dollars per episode on game of thrones in what was the worst season of tv I had seen in my life but wont spend enough money to create a half decent streaming app",
      "overall decent. a couple of annoying things. using chromecast to cast, it stops the connection after like 30 mins. so if u need to pause or something, u have to press cast again to recast. also, if u use subtitles, and watch a show like Westworld, when the characters speak a different language and caption themselves, u cant read sometimes cuz the app's subtitles will overlay the captions with \"starts speaking German\" or wutever language."

      "Works great! Downloaded and connected to my TV in less than one minute. I'm not exaggerating. Our puppy thinks the remote is a toy and I have it held together with tape. It is a replacement to the original and it was very expensive at ( trying to remember here) between 50- 60 bucks so didn't want to replace it again. So happy I found this. Thanks for a great and easy to use app!",
      "The app itself works flawlessly with both samsung tvs i have. The only reason for 3 stars is the ads. Like we don't already have enough ads everywhere else... and you can't just close them either, you have to wait. Like mentioned in other reviews, i understand they have to make money. But why not offer a premium version for $2.99 or whatever with no ads?",
      "This is the best app !!!! After a lot of downloads and deletes , this was the only app that could fully understand and operated my TV, just one thing that is the shortcut smart hub button was not working and I had to do it from the long cut that is from the main menu. Please fix that for a five star rating, THANK YOU IN ADVANCE ☺☺☺",
      "At first when I downloaded everything worked fine. After 7 or 8 times of using the app, suddenly it can't find my TV anymore. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it to get it to work again. Then the same thing happens again. It's a frustrating cycle.",
      "I get that the dev has to make money, I do. But full screen ads on top of banner ads is just too much. Almost every time I bounce out into another app and come back to this one I have to sit thru a full screen ad. Gets rather annoying if all I want to do is a single, quick action. EDIT: No, it's too much. Get rid of the full screens, leave the banners. Painful. Uninstalled."

My problem is; my app updated for a few days at the end of February; there were new stickers and all kinds of cool stuff. But a few days ago, all of that disappeared and I'm left with the same old stickers to apply to your posts, etc. PLEASE HELP!!! I hate having the old version of the app while everyone else had the new! I might delete the app now bc I am so sad!!!",

I am talking about it the one that is in the instructions.",

      "I'm having so much fun with this app! I'm rewatching every wrestling PPV, show, and specials from the 70's forward. I'm about to hit Summer Slam '92! This app is amazing, but I would suggest two things. 1. The buffering issues can be annoying at times. 2. I wish that you have an option to select by year, and it would give you the list of all shows, PPVs, and specials in order(wcw, wwf, ecw included). Right now I am going off a list from Reddit, but it's not always accurate.",
      "If I'm going to watch something like elimination chamber that happened yesterday when I pause / unpause it, it goes right back to the very beginning and restarts everything all over again instead of stopping and picking up where it left off if you can please fix that that would be awesome because I was not having problem with it before it would have been before the new year actually. If you could please fix these bugs, thanks a lot.",
      "Cons: The closed captions are inaccurate on scripted shows. They also censor words that aren't censored in the audio and words that have ass in their spelling. Even if you have orientation locked on your device, the screen rotates. Playback controls require double taps. Pros: Loads of content. Whatever your favorite era of wrestling, you can watch it. The price is well worth it. If the technical issues are fixed, I'd happily rate this 5 stars. I just wish the weekly shows were available sooner.",
      "The problem I'm having is it wont play the most recent ppv. It did this for super showdown as well. It kept saying \"something went wrong, no access granted\" I checked the status of my account and still says subscribed. It loads up every other show as well. Why cant I watch the elimination chamber? I just tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and I get the same message",
      "My only complaint is you cant watch weekly episodes until about 30 days after they air, which makes it almost useless because by that time you've already had what happened spoiled and you just feel like you're behind on everything. However it is a great deal since you can watch PPV events live without having to spend any extra cash, and you get a bunch of cool weekly talk shows/documentaries/etc. to watch. Definitely will keep you entertained."

      "Great quality, very little ads, hardly any buffering, am very satisfied with this app. A dream come true for movie lovers who wanna watch their movies on their phones. My only suggestion would be that it would make it even way better, if there are more 80s and 90s films, rather than just the commonly known films. Don't get me wrong, this app has a great selection of films but I'd love to watch more films from those eras. I usually don't write a review but this app is worth rating for 👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "Very good app brilliant to use and very user friendly. The search button is a great feature as a lot of the apps that I have tried don't have a search button. I also really like the ability to download movies - this makes long car journeys a lot less boring! The only downside is that some movies aren't on there such as back to the future 2 & 3. If I could see these films added it would be a definite 5 star review. Great little app. 👍",
      "I really didnt expect it to have as many movies as they do! There are so many GOOD movies and soo many better ones than majority of these other free apps. My son and i love this app. Lots and lots and lots to chose from. There is one movie i havent came across yet that i would LOVE to see, \"P.S. I Love You\"... Any way u guys can add it to the app?",
      "It's cool because I can watch movies that had come out like the Joker 2019 movie but it's annoying when it adds random movie that you haven't even watched to the \" recently watched\" category, and then sometimes you have to do something with the add below to watch the movie but it's an ok app",
      "Its very hard to find a loyal app like this one, free to download and watch HD movies like *720p* OR *1080p* and its amazing with 1 or 2 ads, its just so perfect just the app im looking for, like no other words can explain it. Thanks To the developers, keep up the good work!"

      "It's nice, when it works! So with my experience the app is great! I wish that it had a function where you could use your phone as a microphone instead of having to text if you didn't want to. Though the texting is good enough if it'll allow the text to be read aloud. I have days where I won't have a problem at all and then I'll have other days where I can't even use it because it won't even try to play my text. It would be definitely a 5 / 5 if it worked all the time!",
      "this app is only compatable with certain games, and chances are, you dont have them. if you can broadcast your gameplay to whoever is watching your stream, then why cant we just do the same with our phones and tablets that are probably in the same building? if xbox can do it, sony sure as hell can and i believe it. Sony, step up your game, this app is so bad that you shouldnt download it at all until they fix it.",
      "Really all I want is for this screen to mirror my TV. That's it. Don't disconnect my controller. Don't take up 70% of the screen with a visual controller. Just mirror what's on my TV. I don't even understand why this isn't a feature. It's actually easier to implement than the garbage they already have in place.",
      "The only reason it even gets 2,is because it works in the menu. Other than that, the controller function is absolutely worthless. It doesn't work inside any other application on the PS4. Sony, you gotta step your game up. Microsoft is leagues ahead of you when it comes to functionality.",
      "App is useless download it for the party text to speech when I play with friends because I'm mute I can't talk it works for a few minutes then I get message can't be read aloud completely garbage don't use you are better off downloading line and make a chat room ther I did and had no problems unlike this app!"

I'm at the BWW now and can't use my points.",
      "While trying to figure out how to spend my points, the confusing layout made me accidentally purchase 20 wings for 3500 points. No verification. No prompt. Placing orders is broken, the app says \"something went wrong, try again later.\" Also you're not given the option to use gift cards as payment.",
      "New app is way better then the old one especially considering it gives you the option to order ahead. BUT! (and this is the reason I had to ding it a star) it took me way to long to figure out how to redeem my points for an instore purchase. Before it was here is what you have do you want to use it. Now it's just hard to tell if it's gonna apply or not. If you want to use on a pre-order it's easy but I eat in store not take home. Make using rewards easier and the all will be 5 star.",
      "Group Check-in feature missing/removed. From the FAQ about the new app. \"WILL THERE STILL BE A BLAZIN’ REWARDS PROGRAM? You better believe there will be. You’ll still be able to do everything you did before, only now you can earn and use points when you place orders online.\" Everything you did before apparently does not include group check-ins.",
      "Before the current update the app was easy to use and could find things quickly. With the current update the app is useless. I cannot figure out how to redeem my points, it seems that they are trying to make sure I don't redeem my points. The app constantly crashes and freezes. Don't fix something that ain't broke."
