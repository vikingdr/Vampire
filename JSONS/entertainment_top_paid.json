      "Who can stand ads? Not me, making the essential purchase to remove such things for an experience that shines nicely for a great quality app. Tip - Walking alone at night? Well, turn up the volume on the scanner and instantly know you're that much safer now. It just eases you out of anxiety and you'll make it with your trusted app.",
      "I've just upgraded to the pro version... So haven't had it that long, however I liked it enough (free version) that I sprang for the pro version. I don't anticipate any issues with it. Have used the free version some time now. Good app... I recommend it. üòÅ",
      "I highly suggest you get the pro version. It is so much better than the ad version. The only time the scanner ever goes down is when the person providing the feed disconnects. It works flawlessly otherwise. I was a beta tester on the other version and decided to get the pro and am very glad I did.",
      "This app adds so much convenience and extra features as opposed to going directly to the Broadcastify website. To me, the differences between the free and Pro version were negligible; but I enjoyed the free version so much that I bought the Pro just to support the developer.",
      "Seems good, I like to listen to Norfolk Southern Railroad when I get to the city and or county they go through, sit by the tracks and watch them roll through; also the only other agencies I can listen to is only Fire & EMS, I've had scanners since my early teen years, I miss not being able to listen to law enforcement these days, as they have all gone to encryption, but thanks for at least providing this scanner app!"

      "Has alot of different tools that are very accurate to the point and they work as intended. Has very interesting features that are neccessary for ghost detecting and hunting. This app is very different unlike any others apps that are like it. Its very useful for everyday use , and I just wanted to say thank you so much to the developers of this app very well done!",
      "Nothing seems to happen, I always feel energy in here, even see things move, That's why I bought this app. Maybe it's just not here now?? Nothing yet so far though unfortunately....just a bunch of annoying noises when I MOVE the phone....the lines jump when I move the phone....its like a prank on people more than anything so far...",
      "I like it. If nothing else, it's super fun to play with. I think the negative reviews are unfair, especially since the creator is more than willing to give refunds if asked. I mean, for $2.49 you turn your phone into a fun ghost hunting device, when all of these things separately would cost between $30 to $400+ dollars. I'm having fun with it :) Thank you for your cool app!",
      "This app is very extensive and has many well designed tools. I've already started having fun but not as much as when I have a better working knowledge the attributes of the app. I was considering going to a cemetery to do some evp's as a test. I recommend that you try this app, you will be satisfied. I'll update my review after I can make a better report. Thank you, Dev.",
      "Looks like it would be a fantastic app. My phone wasn't equipped to handle all the features. Apparently my phone doesn't have the capability for EMF. The developer was very understanding and I got a full refund. I wish all developers were this nice!"

      "The generator is ok. Many \"Examples\" in the memes lean extremely to the left and attack conservative values. I would go as far as saying the creator is inputting his/her political bias within the app. For this reason I would recommend everyone to avoid downloading this app. Choose a different one on playstore. Don't support this type of division.",
      "I've been using this app for years, and was happy to pay for it. Overall, I love this app and wouldn't even think of using anything else...but I HATE that you've removed the Impact font in favor of some wack knock-off version. EDIT AFTER DEV REPLY: Thanks for explaining the licensing fees for the font. I hadn't realized (though I should have!) FIVE STARS for a five-star app.",
      "Great app, allows font importing, sticker maker, and other good tools. My biggest problem is it doesn't save as PNG as far as I know (so there is image compression), and if you have alot of pages you run using various repeat stickers there is no organization. A folder option for the custom sticker section would be great!",
      "This is an awesome meme generator! Making memes is easy with this app. I like the examples for inspiration, they also make me laugh. With tons of images, the ability to use my own pictures, text controls, and options, this is the best and easiest way I've found to make memes. I paid for the pro version because it's worth it.",
      "Had this app for a while bought it to impress a girl, worked like a charm. Now that I have begun to meme I have found it to be quite entertaining. Simple interface makes meming a pleasant experience. Many options to change it up if wanted. Over all a solid app that is updated regularly. Keep up the good work, the development team behind this app is phenomenal."

      "Decent but not great. It has a lot of info for class options and races and a basically solid interphase so it is shocking as you run into its short coming like a lack of multi-closing functions, no easy inventory/equipment management and no feats. I really like what is there but for the money I feel like there is just too much stuff that is missing. I hope they continue to expand functionality because if it had all the needed features this would be the best 5e character app on the market.",
      "Very in depth, i like how easy and accessible everything is, but i wish there was an option to choose multiclass. Most of my characters have been multiclassed characters and i like the individuality it gives them. I know not every campaign does it, but it would be incredibly helpful (to me) if it was added in as a level up option.",
      "Its absolutely amazing, there are some minor kinks to work out but overall it is a good app. The only reason I'm not giving full stars is because they dont have the bloodhunter class, and thats a let down for paying 5 bucks. If this is fixed Id definitally give five stars, and even change this to an outstanding review if they worked out the minor kinks.",
      "Pretty good app, automatically does all the calculations i need when creating/leveling characters, sometimes things can be difficult to understand with the calculations, like some race/class combos give ac class and i cant figure out why it came up with the specific number (tortle monk ac of 20 for example) i would love if they could add homebrew race option (design your own race) as it would need to be approved by a dm anyways, all in all pretty awesome app, super helpful, 100% worth it",
      "It is not easy to load existing characters, as the values are not easily amended once you get past intimal setup. Although there is a ability rolling function it doesn't auto include things like jack of all trades. Weapons have to be manually added which surprised me. I was really hoping for more, considering the number of support apps available from the developer I hoped things like items would be incorporated into the character sheet"

And if you don't have a tablet with the sane brand it's annoying tbh"

Gone are the days of the time consuming entering of shift codes. 5 minutes after downloading the app I had every active shift code on my xbox. Simple simple simple. So refreshing to have a developer make something that works smoothly and in the most effective way possible. I cant see how this app could have been made better. Thanks guys!",
      "This app is a godsend. As a long time borderlands fan, I can tell you, shift codes are a pain in the a**. I often just wouldn't bother because I could be spending time playing instead of spending 30 minutes looking for new codes (I haven't already used) determining if they're valid, and looking from one screen to another typing it in. I just got 6 gold keys in 3 minutes, WHILE ON BREAK AT WORK. Thank you developers for making this awesome app.",
      "Fantastic app. I don't know what else to say. its so easy to use and the fact that it's fast, efficient and no ridiculous phone permissions. Bravo I've already shared in like minded borderlands 3 groups. I definitely recommend it. üëç"

      "Absolutely love the app. It's easy to follow and animate in my opinion, and tells you when you need a new project with mb use, warnings about backing up files, and you actually comment on people's videos, and make funny animations that prove that you're a living being as well instead of some person wanting money and all that. ( Well now you say it's all about the money and all but whatever) Great job Ralph/ Sean/ everyone working in stick nodes! -Zodi-Anims-",
      "This app is amazing! It would be an understatement saying it's better than Pivot. There are countless super helpful features like effects, semi-auto tweening, mode creation, backgrounds and much more. The community is pretty big, but not too big so they interact with each other as if they were friends. The website is awesome, with a wide selection of user-created stickfigures! I rate it a 10/10.",
      "Really useful if you like animating. Edit : more details : you can download stickfigures (also in normal) import sounds, export video, fullscreen, etc.. I wish I could rate this more than 5 stars. BTW can you make sounds playable every time? I don't like how you can play the same sound one time.",
      "I love this app so much!!! I love to create different things, and this app is the best way to show your ideas. I've used this app and the free version for about 3 years now, and I love making animations on here!!! This is by far, the best animation app ever made!"

      "I've had loads of fun with this app! The occasions for practical application are few and far between but the results are great. I do have a few criticisms for the overall experience, but it seems these drawbacks cannot be attributed to this app but rather the technical limitations of Phillips Hue hardware e.g. if you're controlling the bulbs with Alexa, Hue app, and this Disco app, you can get input conflicts. There's also a little latency behind the music. But unlikely to be the App so, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",
      "I've had this app for 3 years and haven't had any issues until now. I'm getting an error message and the app can't find my bridge! If someone know's a fix, I'm all ears! Thx in advance... Ok, so I recently added a vpn to my phone. When I disconnected it, the app worked.",
      "The app basically set itself up and on doing so, didn't connect to one of my lights. There is no way to add the light and the app charged me a second time when I reinstalled it. If it works, it's a cool app, but it didn't work for me.",
      "It worked for about fifteen minutes on the lights it wanted to use, when I tried switching to the lights I wanted it to use in disco mode the app stopped working. The app seemed to hear the music, but the lights did not shift. I couldn't get it to work again, so I uninstalled with refund.",
      "very poor apps doesn't really sync to music just uses your microphone to listen to what's around you therefore if anyone is talking or doing anything different it goes freaking crazy. Unpaired three of my lights and was a complete waste of my time and my money."

I just created my first custom live and wow. WOW. Doesn't take up battery and good for people who are creative. Totally worth that 1.99",
      "Of late I came across, researched and then wanted some simulation app that would give me the ability to create slow moving canvases to relax and drift away to.. you know the saying: \"I'll know it when I see it.\" Well, for me I came across the free app, was totally bought into its vast functionality, and the surreal landscapes one can create, I bought it without hesitation. With a little patience and experimentation I've created my own little colourful worlds. What a gem of an app by its creator.",
      "The best thing I've found ok phone! The amount of options is ridiculous, I can spend hours just playing with this or tweaking it. Still haven't gotten my perfect one, but almost there üòÅ definitely recommend this to everyone!",
      "This is great! Don't compare it to the ripoff \"fluid simulation\" There's so incredibly much variety, even for quality settings. You got a weak device? Lower the quality, strong device? Raise it! Multiple different fluid types, too many settings to choose from, presets if you don't want to make your own. You can also use different types of input for different outcomes, You can even make gas like fluids, I've made rocket engine jets, flames, even explosions with this! Everything's a fluid!"

I wish I could find a good Apps that is real and not joke like this one .",

Also pets from my past have came through and received advice from my grandmother! Get the pro version I firmly believe that this is real! Thank you Ghostcom!!",
      "If you're a sensitive this app will work immensely for you. You're able to hear the spirit in your mind and through the text coming over the app's word bank. If you're not sensitive to the spirit world [just don't have that gift] if any text comes thru, you won't understand it. So, if feeling the presence of ghosts & demons have never been a part of your life then this app probably won't make sense to you. If you want intelligent answers you 1st have to audibly call out to what's around you. üòä",

      "It does not recognize cores installed in retroarch on my Nvidia Shield. The option to automatically search for box art created a folder 7 gigs in size in internal memory, which ran out. The process also took hours despite claims of it being quick. There is no option to change where the art is stored. In fact there are virtually no options at all. Lacks search, recently played, and favorites. Very disappointed, but hopeful it will be usable soon.",
      "So far it works flawlessly. Absolutely no problem importing my ROMS and configuring Retroarch, very easy and intuitive. The interface is simple, good-looking and serviceable, perfect for a smartphone. If I may add a slight criticism/suggestion, a small percent of my games (about 4 or 5 out of several hundreds) failed to download artwork when importing, possibly due to a weird ROM name/version or something; in these cases, it would be very handy if the app included a way to manually add artwork to a game.",
      "it's okay when it comes down to functioning... but for a lot of the games i import, the app doesn't obtain the correct images. sometimes japanese... it does not allow the user to manually edit the images either. UI is really basic and there is no customisation whatsoever. for an app designed to have good looking emulator menus all together, i am disappointed. fix or 1 star forever! this app has potential",
      "So this app doesn't launch the ROM from within launchbox. There are no cores built in like retroarch or OpenEMU So when I launch DK Country 3 from launch box it then opens myboy! app on my phone, when I can just use myboy! to begin with. Minus the pretty albumart I'm assuming the same goes for other consoles in launchbox. Would have been cooler if this was like OpenEMU on the Mac. Runs the apps from the cores inside the emulator software with the same kind of album art concept launchbox uses.",
      "Worth Every Penny!!!! Using my Asus ROG Phone 2. Works perfectly. I also love the layout. Just with NCC use the dolphin emulator app and not retroarch/64. It doesn't work. Only thing I would like to know is how to add missing game art. Other than that I'm absolutely happy.,"

If the this american life team will ask for a donation I'll be happy to give but as a purchase, the app do not worth a penny",
      "I've been having issues with the app on and off since I downloaded it, but the last update (1/10/20) made it impossible for me to listen to any of the episodes. They each play for like two minutes and then stop. I can fast forward or rewind and the app crashes - every time! It is so frustrating because I love listening to TAL. Other issues include having to manually mark episodes as heard, the speed randomly getting so slow that voices are distorted, and having no search bar.",
      "Like you, I am a devoted TAL fan, which is how I ended up purchasing and downloading this app. But buyer beware! There are just so many problems with it, not least of which being that I now can't seem to download or play older episodes (which... isn't that the point?) without the app freezing and closing. In addition, you can't really search for episodes by title (oddly, searching for an exact title name will give you dozens of unrelated results but not the one you're looking for) and you can't search by episode number at all. Links to episodes from other episodes take to you to a page where the download button doesn't exist. The app doesn't automatically mark episodes as \"Heard\" when you've finished listening either, you have to remember to do that yourself. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, and nothing has changed, except now all my bookmarks are gone.",
      "This app has the best content but the worst technical issues. I often have issues with downloads failing, which is frustrating. Whatever \"bug fix\" they implemented on Jan 10 really messed things up though. I can no longer pause the audio or skip ahead, which has prevented me from continuing any shows that I've started and wanted to come back to ‚Äì unless I want to listen to everything again. I put up with the issues because it has 30+ years of TAL content, which gets me through my daily commute.",
      "I use this app for 8 hours a day at my office job. I've experienced the same buggy issues everyone else is but after the most recent update, it's totally broken. Constantly force closes, episodes just sit and spin, pause button doesn't work, no option to fast forward or rewind. Force closing the app doesn't help and I really don't want to uninstall/reinstall... I have 400 episodes that I've marked as Heard or Bookmarked that I don't want to lose. Please fix!!!!!"

Colours seem overexposed now, making the blue dice look who's for example, sound settings are no longer modular (not are there choices for it) and results of rolls are listed very counter intuitively with advantages/threats before success/failure. New wallpapers are nice, but do not really make up for loss of user-friendliness, thus no longer five stars.",

Users could also use this app for any gaming system, but now can only use it for Star Wars. No more using it for d20 or d10 game systems. Hey developers, we paid for the app, shouldn't we as the consumers decide how to use the app?",
      "great app except they updated and removed the standard dice set. Additionally the user interface is more clunky and complicated to use and there's quite a bit of lag and delay when trying to select options. I'm disappointed that I paid for this and then they changed the functionality of the app.",

    "description":"Ghost Detector App #1 \r\nThis 3-in-1 multifunctional ghost hunting app can help you discover paranormal phenomena while saving both time and money by eliminating the need of several other ghost hunting apps.\r\n\r\nThe app contains a EMF-scanner, a Motion Detector and a EVP / Voice recorder that will help you to easily detect EMF (Electromagnetic Fields), Motion and EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). With this tool you will have a much greater chance to succeed with your ghost hunts - a ghost tracker app based on scientific sensors in your smartphone / tablet!\r\n\r\n‚ÄúLaxTon Ghost Sweden‚Äù is the #1 Swedish ghost hunting team and has over 30 years of combined experience in the paranormal area. They have investigated Sweden's most haunted buildings and is now heading for the rest of the world. When developing this application they wanted to select the 3 most useful basic functions used in a ghost hunt.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEMF -  Electromagnetic field (detector / scanner / meter)\r\n\r\nWe are all surrounded by various electrical devices that create natural electromagnetic fields that are affecting us to varying degrees. Some EMF fields, however, lack natural source and these are extra interesting for ghost hunters. Until the day the researchers succeed in presenting scientific evidence for these EMF fields, the phenomenon is paranormal.\r\n\r\nThere is a theory within the paranormal society that you can measure EMF that doesn‚Äôt have a natural power source and this can be paranormal activity. This EMF meter allows you to measure and view your EMF value and communicate with the help of the light that shows how strong EMF value the tool is capturing. \r\n\r\nEasy to use, click the button and scan the area around you.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMotion Detector / Vibration Indicator \r\n\r\nSometimes you can feel small bangs and vibrations in the floors, stairs, chairs and tables. Within the paranormal society we try to capture these vibrations. With this motion detector you can easily register all vibrations and collect the data for later use. \r\n\r\nEasy to use, just place the device where you want to capture motion and then click the button to start collecting motion data.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEVP Recorder - Electronic Voice Phenomenon\r\n\r\nElectronic voice phenomena - test record voices from the dead. With this tool you can run EVP sessions, save the data and evaluate / listen at a later time. Within the paranormal society, EVP recorders are used to capture voices considered to come from the other side, ghosts, lost souls, spirits, scary demons, or whatever you choose to call the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nEasy to use voice recorder - click the button to record and ask questions, then listen through if you managed to capture voices from the other side.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nDisclaimer\r\nMeasurements performed by this app are based on actual sensor readings. There are no fake indications or sound effects. The app uses the actual magnetometer sensor in your device. The result is entirely dependent on the quality of the hardware. We do not recommend anyone to replace dedicated EMF meters with this app. Because the results are not scientifically reviewed, this app should only be used for entertainment. \r\nNOTE - The EMF function in the app can only be used if the device (smartphone/tablet) has a (fully working and calibrated) magnetometer sensor.",

      "I liked it so much at first that I installed it on all of my devices (android & windows 10) but then it began to degrade starting with the loss of Open GL. Enabling it caused it to crash immediately. Thought that solved the problem but then it began to crash randomly especially after using the undo feature multiple times in a row. Now it will crash moments after opening a brand new graph. Even when I save every 30 seconds it will say \"graph already saved\" but it's not the current graph version.",
      "it functions the same as on iPad, but the design and feel is very clunky and laggy and not as smooth as the iOS version. I thought this would be fun to use with my S Pen but it just felt like a waste of 99 cents. I know you (developers) say that you're going to update it after the new iOS update, but you should have just waited to put out a better, more polished and finished android version. still enjoy using it on iPad, but the android version is just not good at all.",
      "It's my fav app to design mandala. But there is one huge problem and the reason why I don't give it 5 stars: it's constantly lagging and my drawing disappears while drawing. So I have to close the app and open it up several times. It you can fix that, I'll give it 5 stars!",
      "Stuck in landscape mode. Quality is mediocre. More functionality in Sketch",
      "The apps good enough. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro. So far, no lag issues as most downloaders said so. But I'm not sure in the future. And also, a layering option would've made the app much better. Is it pressure sensitive if used with a stylus pen? Will do an edit to this review some time in the future."

      "I upgraded to Pro it's good fun and is consistent with what spirits I know to be in my home. You get a full description of the kind of spirit that is near you. So far all good. The words take some working out especially when they appear on top of each other that is the only annoying thing.",

    "description":"Ghost EVP Radio is an exciting simulator that mimics several well known ghost hunting tools such as Ghost- and spiritboxes and EMF measurement devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've put a lot of effort into making this simulator easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast users fully can enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception, and is considered by Paranormal investigators to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts and similar energy based entities. Please note that there is currently no scientific evidence of this to be the case.\r\n\r\nEVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nThis simulator has taken the traditional radio-based ghostbox concept to the next level, and also incorporates an EMF (Electromagnetic Field) scanner.

      "The best I hv found on line, App Works best if used frequently, as I believe the spirits are drawn to the radio frequency' I have had some awesome experiences, The key is you are either a spiritually open person or your not' If you do not believe you will not recieve ' sound familiar'....True, I wish you luck on your Journey, just be safe' everything you allow out you dont know there intentions need to Gaurd yourself,",
      "A good 95% of the time when a spirit are actually is detected, it will talk to me about relevant things. And when I'm like okay I got to go, it tells me please don't leave stay and talk. I think it's a really good app... I've read some of the negative comments, but I actually have heard a number of different voices.. AND!! SOMETIMES, there aren't any entities detected... so if there were trying to fake it, why wouldn't they make conversation every single time? Think about it.",
      "Love using this app! The words come through fairly clearly...and when you can't understand, once calibrated you can read what it said. It's great that it allows you to have so many settings! I can't stand the apps that afford you 1 or 2 settings. Highly recommended!",
      "I've used this app on several occasions and feel like it's a pretty useful tool. After moving into a new home built about 100 years ago, I was able to discover the name of one of the spirits I'd heard in the home was John, and he gave me the number 69. I was able to confirm a prior owner was named John, and the year 1969 was significant for the home/land through county records.",
      "It was a great app until it suddenly started crashing every single time I use it, never lasting more than 11 minutes. I contacted help, they gave me a generic resolution which I tried, but it did not resolve the problem. It has been a month since then, and I have contacted them 3 more times all of which have been ignored. I guess I will not be getting my paid app fixed. I would recommend checking others first, because it seems once they have your money, they don't really care."

      "It just works. Don't need complicated settings for these effects! Whether I'm tired, I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm learning or I'm growing. Lights dance to the music colors chosen by me. So relaxing. Very easy to use. Great price for ALL features. Good job dev. Thank you!",
      "WOW! The app of apps for Phillip's Hue bulbs. Just love this. So easy and enjoyable. I have many Hue bulbs and now once set to 'Rainbow' colour option and 'colour flow' my lights 'set up in a new group on the app' double as Xmas lights fading in and out with configurable brightness and delays and timers etc. Also many other features/modes and effects have yet to play with. Thanks.",
      "UPDATE: changing to 5 stars. Thank you for the tip, Scott. This app works! Original: Good app for syncing lights to music playing on your phone. I wish this worked with Google Home speakers.",
      "Initially downloaded another app sponcered by Hue but returned immediately. This app is significantly better with fantastic ease of use.",
      "Does successfully control my lights. Two main issues though. First, didn't detect the Hue Bridge on my network without manually entering the IP; I haven't had this problem with any other app. Second, I don't think the music visualizer is actually listening to the music. The lights change rhythmically but not in time with the music, it seems like it a constant tempo. I compared this to the Hue Disco app and the latter does vary the lights based on the temp."

      "I like your app. And i give it 4 stars. I would g i ve a higher rating if you can provide me with some more info on the health concern or danger level of the readings i\"m getting . The readings are consistantly much higher than the normal average of 30-60 MiicroTesla. IN FACT , MY AVERAGE READINGS ARE 300 - 1000 MicroTesla. How concerned should i be about this??? I woiuld appreciate some confidential insight on this matter and will raise my rating",
      "Nicely presented and well thought out. It is of course heavily dependent on the quality and sensitivity of the the flux sensor in your phone. It's worthwhile trying to draw a heavy inductive load in the cable you're trying to trace, but this is not always possible. When testing it, I could find a cable from 20cm away when it was conducting 3A powering a 1hp motor, but nothing near a light switch's cable buried in a wall; this is a very small resistive load.",
      "i always sceptical about this kind of program. but i'll try this for couple days ahead and see the result. 1 star till otherwise. as i said, change the 1 star to 5 stars after try it. it actually exceed my hope. great program and the ui is easy to understand",
      "This app is something every concerned individual should have. Something to let us know how much exposure we're bombarded at any given time. It would also be practicable to have an alarm switch to allow a warning signal when exposure of EMF'S exceed a safe, excessive or is dangerously higher than normal. It does but as long as I have it on. Otherwise, it's practicality is quite evident, it's fine as it is! Thanks!",

      "OMG! This is amusing and wonderful! I bumped into this by accident and figured what the heck. It's only three bucks. Easy to use and quite enjoyable especially if you have a thunderstorm cranking out of your Bluetooth speaker. One footnote. It's more effective with lights you do not have direct line of sight to. For example a light bulb behind a lamp shade or in my case it was especially effective with the light strip hidden behind my television (reflecting off the wall). Thanks!",
      "Cool app, but missing video option on TV after I cast my phone to TV via GHome to get sound from phone trough my home sound system. It's kinda lame to see lights & sound create nice atmosphere, but then the phone screen without anything cool matching cast to TV. Can't you add a video in the casting from the GHome app too (not just sound)? Fix this good Sir, and that last star will come flying in! :)",

      "3 of 5 just some update required. Dev. plz add price section for blueprints, design, diagram, pattern, praxis. U can make it like blue design selling for avr. Purple selling for avr. Gold avrg. etc or same like Motifs. Just to get idea for how much we can sell this. Easy update, easy check price. Anyway still good app due to no concurrent, no other on the market yet. It only one app for PS4 :)",
      "Really great app Toobad a only covers Play station 4 servers When playing he is so keep in mind the console you play varies the prices For example Torch bug thorax on xbox servers goes for 350 gold each according to eso Price checker Torch bug thorax goes for 29K huge difference the reasoning why is Supply and demand",
      "Very handy, wish it would show recipes but theres too.many",
      "Wanted to like this app but there is just too much missing. Unless you want to search specifically for weapon/armour sets with one of only 3 traits, it's not very useful. No way to search by trait for research items like nirnhoned. It lists furnishing materials but not the recipes or the actual crafted items. If you want the price of bait (assuming you don't have 100s already) they've got you covered. I'm sure it's useful for some people, but while it has so many things excluded, it's not for me",
      "The item description isnt specific with the rate of currency, and this app does not have all of the recipes or information you may be looking for as a top teir player. App is a bust. Wouldn't reccomend to eso gamers looking to understand the market in ESO"

It will also be great if they can add so that the M controlers move up and down and forw",

    "description":"Endless RPG is a random dungeon and map generator for Dungeons and Dragons  5e and Pathfinder 1e roleplaying games aimed at solo players or players who want to explore without a DM. The explore-as-you-go design is great for playing alone, but the DM tools also provide map making help to focus on story instead of encounter design.\r\n\r\nENDLESS RPG IS A D&D / PATHFINDER TOOL\r\n\r\nThe Random Dungeon Generator is a tool for playing tabletop role-playing games alone, in a small group without a DM, or as a DM tool for building adventures. It is not a standalone game and will not DM combat for you. The purpose of the map generator is to allow players to play without a dedicated DM or to allow DMs to focus more on story than map generation. \r\n\r\nD&D 5TH EDITION OR PATHFINDER 1E\r\n\r\nThe two most popular tabletop roleplaying systems are supported.  All standard bestiary is included for Pathfinder, and D&D support includes the Tomb of Foes and Volo's Guide. These additional monster manuals can be turned on or off in settings, allowing you to customize the dungeon based on the books you own.\r\n\r\nPLAY PATHFINDER OR DND ALONE OR IN A GROUP WITHOUT A DM\r\n\r\nThe Random Dungeon Generator allows you to explore a randomly-generated map (tower, ruin, etc.) through a fog-of-war discovery system with encounters, traps, tricks and treasures shown as you encounter them. This is great for solo play or those without a DM. Read more about playing d&d or pathfinder solo.\r\n\r\nDM TOOLS\r\n\r\nThe DM Tools allow the app to take the burden out of being a game master. The DM can use the tool to do the heavy lifting of designing the map while the DM focuses on story.

The missions can also be on a single level or multiple levels mixing and matching the dungeon types, so you can explore a cave that leads to ruins or a stronghold with a dungeon below it.

Casting this app onto a flatscreen always gets my players hyped. I do wish I could drag and drop whatever I wanted, but I can't complain. The visual references this app provides are a blast. Really happy with this app and the fun our group has had using it.",
      "No casting option, goals are just pictures with no description to what they are, no tutorial or explanation on how to use this. Feels incomplete and needs more work before it should be sold. Very much regret wasting my money.",
      "This is one of the best Dungeon Generators out there, it's great for solo Dungeon crawling. The dev is awesome, had a issue with the new update and got it fixed the same day! One thing I feel this app needs is a away for us to mod the app. I like D&D and PF, but there are other RPGs too. TSR had a cool Marvel RPG back in the day, it would be cool to play that RPG in this app. We could make our own minis,city maps,the Marvel dice system is very simple, it just uses percent dice.",
      "It was an awesome app but now it will start to load and go to black screen on not just my phone but my tablet and all other devices I have it downloaded on... something changed in the programming....Please advise.",
      "Not a bad app, just not quite what I was looking for. If you made one more tailored more for a DM: i.e. can control map size, manually place monsters, and add some outside (swamp, forest, dessert) options as well, I would gladly buy for same price."

      "Not worth using. Yet alone paying for App is designed like it was made in 2005. Horrible looking and scaled. Camera feature is broken and if the first number in the serial is 0 it won't be able to read it. Also only able to get serial off camera and rather than scan and go you take a photo, crop, the submit and hope it reads. Camera also flops from portrait to landscape mode without phone moving.",
      "The OCR usually works, but needs improvement. After taking a clear, crisp photo of a serial number, you have to crop to the serial number, and then it's uploaded for OCR. But for some reason the app degrades the quality of your crisp photo, so that the numbers bleed together and C & G are easily confused. It has even gotten some numbers wrong.",

Instead, the app uses your phone/tablet's built-in Text to Speech engine, if it has any. If your device doesn't have a TTS engine installed, the voice messages will not play, but everything else in the alerts will. The Google Play store has plenty of TTS engines and voices (both Free and Paid) you can use. If you want to use different voices in your alerts, you need to download and install a different TTS engine on your device and set it as the default.\r\n‚Ä¢ Sadly, it's not possible to share/export the alerts as videos for technical reasons and I'm aware that is a very desired feature. Some users managed to record the footage on a PC using dedicated software and others used screen recording apps that can be found on the store.\r\n  \r\n KNOWN ISSUES: \r\n‚Ä¢ Users with U.S. models of Samsung Galaxy S4 devices running Android 4.2.2 reported that the Custom Attention Signal feature may produce some clicking noises instead of the actual tone. This is a firmware-related problem with tone generation which unfortunately has to be fixed by Samsung with an update. Affected devices can use the Default Attention Signals (fixed frequencies and duration) without any problems though.\r\n‚Ä¢ If you find any other problems feel free to e-mail the developer.\r\n \r\n PERMISSIONS: \r\n‚Ä¢ Prevent device from sleeping: To make sure that the screen doesn't turn off due to inactivity while playing a EAS message.",

If your device doesn&#39;t have a TTS engine installed, the voice messages will not play, but everything else in the alerts will. The Google Play store has plenty of TTS engines and voices (both Free and Paid) you can use. If you want to use different voices in your alerts, you need to download and install a different TTS engine on your device and set it as the default.<br>‚Ä¢ Sadly, it&#39;s not possible to share/export the alerts as videos for technical reasons and I&#39;m aware that is a very desired feature. Some users managed to record the footage on a PC using dedicated software and others used screen recording apps that can be found on the store.<br>  <br><b> KNOWN ISSUES: </b><br>‚Ä¢ Users with U.S. models of Samsung Galaxy S4 devices running Android 4.2.2 reported that the Custom Attention Signal feature may produce some clicking noises instead of the actual tone. This is a firmware-related problem with tone generation which unfortunately has to be fixed by Samsung with an update. Affected devices can use the Default Attention Signals (fixed frequencies and duration) without any problems though.<br>‚Ä¢ If you find any other problems feel free to e-mail the developer.<br> <br><b> PERMISSIONS: </b><br>‚Ä¢ Prevent device from sleeping: To make sure that the screen doesn&#39;t turn off due to inactivity while playing a EAS message.",

It glitches out really badly if you switch from portrait to landscape, making you close the app and find out you have to make the eas all over again.

      "I don't know if I'm doing this wrong but this app doesn't work on my Android Motorola phone. when I tried using this thing when you put in one of those little stickers of a lightsaber the fact is it doesn't work properly. To explain it basically what happens is that usually when I even try to put one sticker on there's like 20 of them on screen and I don't know how to change that. I tried looking at the settings but there is no way of like removing all those giants stickers. I want a refund.",
      "Fun to play around with, but you can only use landscape camera mod and everytime I try to make a video it thinks I'm using portrait mode so it doesn't work unless you rotate it in a video orientation app. The stickers for the saber blur effect place only the the top and/or bottom of the sticker.",
      "TERRIBLE. Third time buying this app in my life but this time I need it for a university project. WILL NOT EXPORT VIDEO. WILL FREEZE. WILL CRASH. Stuck on loading for hours and this hasn't been fixed yet. They have the nerve to not even bother looking into this as their last update was released months ago. I'll remove this review when I can export footage without it freezing, or am refunded.",
      "I love this app, it is fun to make lightsaber videos, but there's problems, so basically if there is too much frames with the effects on it it gets super laggy and it takes like a day to make a movie, and also when you put in sound effects it would make it easier if you were still in the editor and you could actualy hear the sound effects, also please add more sound effects like for the cross blade because the sound of that lightsaber is supost to sound unstable but we have to use the regular fx"

I like the separate sessions enough that I have probably spent about 20-30 dollars within the application. I understand that each \"tune\" costs time and money to produce, so I'm willing to pay for them, but where are the package deals for hard core users? Why is the UI of the app so terrible relative to the quality of the tunes and cost? There are so many missing and poorly designed features.",

I've been using for about a year now, and I'm hoping to have one of the delayed success stories, but... the app crashes every single time I use it now. I really believed in this product once, and now I just really feel like a desperate idiot hoping for a contact high. I'll keep trying, though, cuz I'm that guy. sigh.",

      "I love the cards, but I am unable to save any info like the question pertaining to the card , since i am only able to save the card, i still need to keep a separate log to record the question.  I am also unable to share a reading via mail, messenger or what app. This GREATLY LIMITS THE SPREAD of this app and its subsequent purchase by more people. When will these features be available ?  Looking forward to hearing back from you,   Werner",
      "Just got this app yesterday and I can already see the synchronicity. I own 2 of Teal's books and she remains very consistent, which is reflected in this app. Definitely worth the spiritual investment.",
      "This is an incredible tool I use every day. It really points out my shadows and helps me face my challenges. I'm so grateful for this because for a few weeks I had been looking for Oracle cards in several stores. Now I have my tarot and my Oracle cards on my phone so I can do them anywhere at any time, and for anyone! Thank you Teal and team!!!",
      "Very accurate and insightful, and I love that the app is light-weight and doesn't require any permissions. If anything could be improved, it's that the card descriptions could be edited a bit for clarity and made more succinct. Overall a wonderful and useful app for increasing awareness!",
      "Amazing app, the cards(sigils) with the descriptions so well aligned that the app indeed is in a magnetic frequency . In fact the app launching was in such a beautiful phase which was definitely much much needed. Teal as we all know is a revolutionary self help transformer, with this app and the messages aligned to the sigils, she not only is helping us know deeper about sigils but the app is greatly a to go to and refer to app at this point when the need for validation is at peak."

It would be cool to add maps in there as an option. Some UI areas are a bit clunky but speed and accuracy makes it a very valuable experience overall.",

But there's been instances where I would say no to the trap answer, and I would be applauded by the game for not falling for it, then right after, confirm its correct guess and then told it failed the validity check? I'll happily alter my rating if the feature is fixed."

Needs a set name age, ideally over 18, imo and history. Her Responses are kind of scary. like 'how about a little LMK? ÔºàLet Me Know. ÔºâDo you want to live?'questions like that sound like a threat. it's not cool. but overall a good user experience. could use a touch screen to touch her face., or brush her hair.

Thank you for your work with this great app.",

      "Love this app. Very easy to understand and configure. Many options and effects. Great",
      "Dear Good work but it doesn't have scheduling possibility on the bridge. App needs to be open to function. Hence it is useless for me. I put a Hue Play in my fireplace and I don't expect to manually turn it on every day with the app open on my phone all the time... Hence I like to return the app and ask for a refund please. Thanks",
      "Ok app, and to be fair, would maybe look better if I had 2-4 lights all next to each other instead of just 2 in neighboring rooms. Flickering feels a little predictable/not very random. Wish you could control how much the brightness changes because I think the candle would look better if the intensity didn't vary quite as much."

      "Wonderful app! Great search functions for recipes and ingredients. Only suggestions are that I'd like a thumbnail of the dish and that it's missing a few ingredients. Raw bird thigh and raw whole bird that I've noticed.",
      "whoever designed this app deserves more than $.99 for it. it's an incredibly useful & resourceful app for one of, if not THE greatest game made. thank you for your efforts!! after my review I found that a gentleman named James created this app. many thanks, James!",
      "Pretty damn good companion app for BotW. Would be perfect if you could filter/organize the recipes by how many hearts/ how much stamina/ how long the desired effect lasts. Then it would be perfect. :) Not a gripe, but more of a suggestion. Thank you for the cool app!",
      "Excellent app. I have been wasting so many ingredients trying out different recipes and elixirs for certain boosts and resistence duration. I only wish I found this app sooner not 40+ hours into the game! Def recommend for Zelda BOTW fans.",
      "Thank you for your hard work and dedication to the BOTW community. Wish I knew someone like you - so many games need apps like this and I always think how great it would be if I could be so amazing like JM and just create my own. Fortunately for me, my favorite game Zelda BOTW has this masterful cooking app. Good luck in your future projects and appreciate any further work you put into this excellent, five star app. Also, a low price = tremendous value. This IS the app you need for BOTW."

It's awesome, can use with multiple Geni's or the main box, the app is fully customizable and it is always with me on my phone. I wish I could get the volume plugin to work, but that's OK, I found an app for my TV.",
      "Used to work great, but it's now zoomed in to the screen so that only part of the remote is visible. Not only does that mean you can't see many of the buttons, but you can't get to settings or change set top boxes. Tried reinstalling and didn't help. Likely just uninstalling and moving on.",
      "Didn't work for me i went to school for networking and it's just not working on my genie I even changed settings to my network followed the developer steps yes both were on the same network and nothing it's the genie. It took me a month or two to get around to trying but the loss in $ is my own fault for not trying sooner could be the LG v30 ive been having problems with idk",

      "Very handy to do on the spot readings for myself! I like it.",
      "This app is great for those just beginning with tarot and the many different readings! I knew nothing upon installing it, but now feel fairly comfortable working with a physical deck. Each card has great descriptions for both an upright spread or reversed, which really comes in handy. I got the full version with the ebook as well, which goes further into explaining every card, the spreads, symbolism, etc. Highly recommended!",
      "as good as a tarot app could ever be. sure, it may cost a few bucks to get the full version... but that's only to make the unimaginably long periods of hard work and time I'm sure went into making this at least somewhat profitable for the creator. I send all the good energy I've received from having this app right back to you good sir."

      "I uploaded every .por file I had to my phone. 1 in 10 worked. It wouldn't show me their ability scores, their equipment, class or race abilities. The only pattern in which ones seem to work is that they were characters I'd never really been interested in or would never get a chance to play. As if the app somehow knew.",
      "This app is extremely handy on the fly. I love the built in dice roller and all the calculation it makes for you. I would give it 5 stars if it included psion powers in the spell list. Other than that, this is a solid pathfinder character sheet manager for on the go play.",
      "To make this work, you have to email your created hero lab characters to yourself, open the email on your Android tablet or phone and download the file! Then you open the app and import the character. Easy when you know how :)",
      "Liked the lite version and bought this app thinking it would be better. It's literally the same thing only it took me more time to figure out how to import my .por character sheets. It doesn't even let you fiddle with the in-play toggles like power attack and combat expertise etc. The name of the developer \"Dysfunctional Apps\" says it all lol. Save a dollar and stick with lite version. At least there is a refund option!!",
      "Bought this app, to use my D&D 5E character sheet.  When I first started the app, it said that it was known the app couldn't open those file types.  I checked the store page, and didn't see anything I missed about not being able to not open 5E characters.  Would have been nice to know, before I gave this app money."

After that happens, I don't get the stamp when the alarm rings. A fix for that would be nice. Same thing occurred in the Illya alarm app, too.",

      "I really like this app, it's simple to make quick little games to play when you're bored. However, I have a couple criticisms. First, just get first of limits on things like health, there isn't really point to do it. Second, update the Tower Defense genre, such as adding things like damage over times or slowness effects, and definitely make it so you can send multiple types of enemies in a wave. That get irritating having to make a bunch of entrances. Overall a great app though.",
      "The app is great! Really fun and after tutorial videos it is easy to use. As of right now though the app is crashing with an error code and hope this gets fixed soon. Here also are a few things I would want to see changed before I give it a higher rating... The sound selection is quite limited, please add more sound selection. The limitation of points for certain objects should increase. The ability for a block object to also move up and down and not just left to right.",
      "Nice and easy to use, but I have suggestions. These are some of them. 1. More movement options for enemies and monsters, like jumping. 2. The ability to make slightly more complex enemy behaviors via adding more than one attack or projectile. 3. Water tiles. 4. More player movement options, like crouching, climbing and maybe a grappling hook or a dash attack, that could help spice up the game play. 5. Parallax Backgrounds. 6. Metroidvania genre. 7. An expanded music maker. 8. Ice tiles.",
      "Hey Silent Works! The app is great for making simple games on your phone! But, editing levels can be a struggle while trying to avoid overlapping tiles while moving the screen in order to continue making levels. If there were a way to make the leveling process easier, that would be great! Also, the sprite editor is the best I've seen on the market. If there were a way to export the sprites to image files, that would allow for adapting your game to other platforms. Hope to see export options! TY!",
      "add homing bullets, a guitar [any kind will do], sine wave and triangle instrument for the music editor, long notes, more layers for the music sheets, more music SHEETS, a fighting genre, and blocks that move up and down as opposed to just left and right. Really like this app and I think it would be better with these features added. MSklgnsedegibnrpb oegwnwegnwop im sweet games i dont use grammar"

I would love it if it kept the leaderboard in the same order as the initial entries. It scrambles the entries in alphabetical order which I don't care for. Also it would be great if there was a cloud that linked the games to all devices and also the ability to edit the names of the games eg. 'The one where David won'. Also, with a lot of scores it seems to get slightly sluggish.",

This game does not deserve for you to pay.üëéüëéüëéüòîüòîüò† sucks. Is having a buzzer on your finger really fun? Make a shock instead,it literally is called shock my friend's! üò†",

      "Like others this took a bit of getting used to as it's not as intuitive as the normal geocache app. However, it's much more powerful and worth persevering with. It also used much less battery than the official Geocaching app, as well as the location being more accurate. The only criticism I would say is that there is little explanation of all the features. It would really benefit from a wiki of some kind. For instance, an almost unforgivable omission is the fact it doesn't include footpath maps by default, you have to pay a subscription to use your own maps. Bearing in mind a lot of geocaches are in rural areas that is a major omission in my opinion. That said, email support was prompt and helpful and so I am giving five stars. Hopefully it will improve over time.",
      "In the current build, save the money, go with c:geo. It's free and works well. Yes, it may not have all the bells and whistles this one has (hence the 2 stars) but it does what it needs to do well. One thing this app has that is nice is the integrated whereigo app, but I have not used it as of yet (there really aren't that many locations in my area to utilize it). There are other free apps out there that work well or better. I would add more to this review, but I'm limited to 500 characters.",
      "I have been afraid I will not find a good geocaching app for Android after I switched from iOS but I was wrong. Granted I have not used it much yet as I just downloaded few days ago but it is what I have been looking for. Price of the app including subscription is well worth it. So far so good, I will use this app a bit more over next few months and will update the review. Update 19.01.2020: this far very impressed with the app. By far the best geocaching app I have ever used. Keep it up.",
      "My traditional wherigo app was having trouble downloading a cartridge, so i decided to take a chance on something new. It's a great looking app that functions as intended, but i have never had anything drain my battery as fast. With all other apps closed and brightness at minimum, my battery was depleted in less than an hour. Not enough time to complete a single cartridge. This was the case on two samsung phones, so not a coincidence. Only use with an additional battery pack. Otherwise useless.",
      "So far I like this app but it is a little difficult to navigate especially to find saved logs to be published. Secondly the Auto TB visits when logging caches i can't get it to log visits for multiple trackables. I did get it to do one but not multiple. Looking forward to getting into this app further and learn its working. Great job so far."

I'm certain it was my step dad who came through üòä I can't wait to keep trying it, thankyou üòä",
      "Changed my ratings guys! I come from England and the family is as English as they come...your App gives out Scots dialect, right up until english speaking words flew out! Thanks for this and your help. The revisit of video was worth it. The spirits in my home have a voice at last. Thank you x",
      "I installed this app early September and have been testing it for a couple of weeks. During that time I have received many clear captures using the app at the recommended settings. A few examples of the captures were \"Us we are spirits\", \"They are in the birthday club\", \"I'm lonely\", \"Good afternoon\", \"Awake all the spirits\" and \"I'm dead\". This is an excellent app and I highly recommend it if you are interested in paranormal investigation. Five stars!",
      "As an early access tester I've loved this App since day one of using it.Easy to use and the validated results I've received from feedback from Facebook live sessions from unrelated viewers have been amazing. I've tested the app on a Samsung galaxy Tab,kindle fire HD,Huawei mate 20 pro and Galaxy S9 plus and have had zero glitches or crashes. Top notch app and my personal favourite ITC app.",

      "Great app overall. Best one on Google Play I could find. A couple of missing features that would be nice to have: 1. Media Controls i.e. play/pause via headset buttons and 2. The ability to choose to play without any lights being controlled.",
      "Love this app. But would like to see more customisation. For example. The ability to set the colour curve so at the start of the flash initially its light blue and as it comes to the end of the flash it turns crispy white. So in other words you can adjust the colour within a single flash so it transitions from blue to white in an instant. Also customisation for the duration and type of flash. It could start off with a series of minor very quick flashes and then a big flash at the end.",
      "Best Lifx thunderstorm app hands down. Worth every penny give it a try. Works every time easy to use and understand.",
      "This app really made everyone talk about my house on the block for 2017 Halloween night. This was just the thing I wanted to make my house stand out from the others. I had my tablet running this on my garage sound system and my eves of my 3 car garage were lined with my Lifx lightstrips. It made the little kids jump when the lightening and thunder popped. Thank you so much for creating this great app!",
      "Update 2: I just wanted to let you know that this app is completely broken on the essential PH-1. Almost nothing works properly. I'm not knocking it star wise because I know it can be great on other devices.  Update: Everything I wanted has been implemented. The developer is amazing and I couldn't recommend this app more! - - - - - -  Previous: I would like it more if the lights would flicker quickly when lightning strikes. Also, you should add the background sounds from you're new thunderstorms app. The lightning is sometimes blue too when i have it set to white. I own 4 of your apps so you're doing something right though. I'll update to 5 stars if you implement the features above."

If you want to change the design into real beads afterwards you should chose the brand of beads you have available such as Hama Beads, Perler Beads, Artkal Beads, Nabbi Beads or Pyssla Beads. If you don‚Äôt have all the colors then just make your own palette with the colors you have, where mixing beads from different brands is possible.

      "Downloaded yesterday. It has a slight learning curve. EDIT: Thanks to the developer for fixing the bug issue of the add/delete row buttons disappearing on mobile phones. I use this app now as my go-to bead designer. I do love that it has the most up to date Perler bead colors and that you can change beads easily.",
      "Love it! Can do peyote patterns, beadloom patterns, and brick earring patterns. The only hard part is selecting which bead pallet to use or which beads to select when making my own pallet",
      "Great so far, would love the following two features. 1. No limit to zooming in. I place the pegboard directly above my phone to try and line up the squares with each pixel, since i dont use printed sheets, but the display is barely big enough to evenly line up. Zooming in further would fix this. 2. Would be nice if there was a toggle button that would basically change each bead on the board into its pixel counterpart, so instead of showing the round bead shape it would show a full square (pixel).",
      "Im new to this and the program is pretty intuitive and easy to use. It seems to over complicate the color selectio When importing simple images with only a few colors. Other than that its great!"

      "The druid oracle cards app comes with two equally lovely decks which you can use seperately or together. I also love that you can toggle reversals on and off. Each card comes with a detailed explanation for upright and reversed, and a history of the symbols they chose. Most importantly I feel that the meaning of the cards are very well chosen, and offer a good and practical range of answers, such that the answers are always easy for me to understand and apply directly to my life. Very satisfied!",
      "Fantastic artwork and really lovely, rich detailed descriptions that really strike chords with the daily cards. These folks really dive deep with each and every card, and I ferl educated after each one",
      "Smooth operation, lots of options for decks and meanings. Beautiful illustrations. Complete text of book included as well.",
      "Excellent deck. I've gotten some very good readings from these, although I was skeptical about using tarot on an app! I have the physical animal deck and I hope to also get the plant deck someday.",
      "Great application, with wonderful functionality and very insightful content."

Makes it kind of hard to see what they're actually doing. Only one level, and six short activities. Three year finished all the activities with 3-stars.",
      "Excellent graphics although it lacks variety, more permutations on activities would be good!",
      "Paid for this app so my little guy wouldn't have to deal with ads. There is only one level. Once he completed the 4-5 tasks on the first level that's it .  Total waste of money.  Maybe 20 minutes of play and that is it to the app.  Wish I could get my money back. We have used apps that have free trial levels that have more to them than this app.  Two thumbs down.",
      "It's OK or the first few minutes but gets very boring soon after. Not worth ¬£2.99. Could easily add many more levels and challenges. What you saw on YouTube was the whole game.",
      "Great graphics n fun for 3 year old. Sweeper to clean road, concrete mixing, brick laying, unloading, digging, roof tiling n house painting. Kids learn patience n process."

That being said, it seems to use an internal browser for connecting to YouTube, which is fine, but it's not possible to login to this internal app. Attempting to do so fails. So you are unable to rate, or save videos and you are forced to watch ads even if you subscribe to Red. This could use some improvement."

I appreciate that the wordlist is genuinely random and not just filled with the top 20 names and a bunch of potentially relevant words to make you think it's working. This honestly developed app is one of the most authentic ways you can communicate with the spiritual realm. I had some relevant word matches which were unbelievable. Highly recommend.",

I've contacted the developer, and Google, the developer has absolved all responsibility, and Google hasn't responded! not happy!",
