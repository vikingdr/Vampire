      "I'm having so much fun with this app! I'm rewatching every wrestling PPV, show, and specials from the 70's forward. I'm about to hit Summer Slam '92! This app is amazing, but I would suggest two things. 1. The buffering issues can be annoying at times. 2. I wish that you have an option to select by year, and it would give you the list of all shows, PPVs, and specials in order(wcw, wwf, ecw included). Right now I am going off a list from Reddit, but it's not always accurate.",
      "If I'm going to watch something like elimination chamber that happened yesterday when I pause / unpause it, it goes right back to the very beginning and restarts everything all over again instead of stopping and picking up where it left off if you can please fix that that would be awesome because I was not having problem with it before it would have been before the new year actually. If you could please fix these bugs, thanks a lot.",
      "Cons: The closed captions are inaccurate on scripted shows. They also censor words that aren't censored in the audio and words that have ass in their spelling. Even if you have orientation locked on your device, the screen rotates. Playback controls require double taps. Pros: Loads of content. Whatever your favorite era of wrestling, you can watch it. The price is well worth it. If the technical issues are fixed, I'd happily rate this 5 stars. I just wish the weekly shows were available sooner.",
      "The problem I'm having is it wont play the most recent ppv. It did this for super showdown as well. It kept saying \"something went wrong, no access granted\" I checked the status of my account and still says subscribed. It loads up every other show as well. Why cant I watch the elimination chamber? I just tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and I get the same message",
      "My only complaint is you cant watch weekly episodes until about 30 days after they air, which makes it almost useless because by that time you've already had what happened spoiled and you just feel like you're behind on everything. However it is a great deal since you can watch PPV events live without having to spend any extra cash, and you get a bunch of cool weekly talk shows/documentaries/etc. to watch. Definitely will keep you entertained."

      "The mobile version of this app is frustrating. It's great when it decides to work but 95% of the time, the app wont load, when it does load and play a video, it is constantly freezing. It also will freeze and then skip back by itself and replay audio that has past and then start playing again just to freeze again. Can we please have someone look into this and actually fix it????!!!",
      "I'm sorry but this is ridiculous. The episodes. Don't play without glitches, if they play at all. One minute I can watch on my TV, the next I can't. Then there's the mobile app, which is a total loss. But what is REALLY effing annoying and weird, is that an episode is English dubbed one second, and Japanese subbed the next. And it happens, WHILE YOU'RE watching!!! I appreciate funimarion for providing fans with dub options, but the app is a disaster. And the website is even worse.",
      "App needs work. Clicking on things like \"recently add\" takes you to list that keeps refreshing when you get to the end. What looks like 100s of shows is really just the same 15 shows repeated again and again. Click on a show and going back takes you all the way to the top of the list. There is also video playback issues... forever to load, pause and can't continue. Want to go back or skip forward a few seconds, nope, video stops working. Overall just a poor UI. Also needs a night mode.",
      "This is my second review. I noticed you respond regularly to these however instead of \"talk to customer support\", \"sorry you're having a bad time.\" and shrugging off doing something about it put some effort into fixing the app or just take it down. You have all the clear consistent information you need to figure it out: laggy, freezes, slow, bad resolution ect. It's not us it's you and we would dearly love for you to fix it so we can actually enjoy the content you provide.",
      "I have this app on my phone, it's really awesome. I love it, but it won't let me subscribe even on the website, and I would like to. Sometimes when I go to a different page it's just blank, and I have to start all over. Not all the episodes of some anime are in English and I'm not really into reading subtitles so I have started some and don't finish. Other than that I deal with it and will continue watching, and trying to subscribe."

      "This is the real thing! I have been paid well over $100.00 in gift cards. at $5.00 each. they keep super detailed count of your earnings and I have never had a single problem. I could have made 4 times more had I followed their suggestion about how long to interact with each game. sometimes I would play a single game for over an hour when they had reminded me that the 4 minutes were over and went back. I have tried all of the other make money while playing, but none have come close. Kat B.",
      "Decided since we all have a lot of time on our hands, I would give this a shot. The 1st $5 was quick & easy so I set my sites on the $25 reward. That seemed to take forever! Still, it's a nice way to get a few extra bucks in your spare time. Also, I decided instead of getting a reward for the theater maybe I should get it for Amazon with the way things are going, I might need those emergency funds for toilet paper! Lol. Seriously tho, anyone reading this, stay safe & healthy please ♡",
      "I have used a lot of apps that reward you for playing games and doing survey's but this one is by far the best one. Within the first 2 days they basically gave me a 5 dollar gift card. Additionally, a few days later I had enough to get another 5 dollar gift card! I also recently had an issue with not being rewarded my points with I the app and contacted support and they fixed the issue for me within a day and a half.",
      "It sucks. All ur apps wont give me videos to watch. I was going good earlier. Now as usual it wont give me points. I've been trying since last july to get 1 of it 25 dollar cards. I've 7nenstalled hundreds of times, cleared all data, and restarted my phone. I've done everything any of u could possibly say for me to do and I still keep has having issues. Even hen I had my phone as brand new Las august someone told me it's my phone that's the problem. Even my moms bran new phone the app dont work.",
      "So glad that it worked! I was using Mistplay (which is awesome, too) and decided to try this one as well. It has multiple times of day where it allows you to get more points playing multiple games for a few hours, surveys, and you can watch ads to support them and or enter a contest to get a 5 dollar gift card. The games you play though do have a limit of having to be played for at least two minutes and those points are only made once a day. But they also have \"extended apps.\""

      "Terrible. You open the app and doesn't let you play. It immediately wants you to buy the pro option. You can't play unless you buy it. This makes me think that there probably isn't just a free play option. Edit: found out that this company stole parts of a vidio on YouTube for their ads. The uploader did not give permission, and it's not even the same game. This is a terrible product, and the developers should be ashamed.",
      "Stupid touch app, lets you drag slime over the screen and charges 81$ for access to more slime. My 4 yr old has bought VIP, currently trying to gain a refund. I understand my child should have been watched a little closer, but even that aside, if I had bought this app for that much, it would still prompt a refund since the cost simply is not justified by the product. Will hopefully be able to repost a nice story soon.",
      "I mean I with alot of people on 1 star reviews! This app is horrible you can't play it because you get bored waiting for the X so then you can get of this add wanting you to buy products!Its getting annoying coming on a app that used to be great no adds or anything but now its just ruined! I hope nobody bought that add because its a waste! Whoever made this should be ashamed!",
      "Never got around to playing as the fact it's subscription-based put me off. Three days of free trial followed no free option but an immediate £49.49, whatever it was, is ridiculous considering the potential nothingness of this game. *edit - apparently there IS a free option, however the developers have designed this (very sneakily) so that it takes a long time for the X to close down the subscribe option (according to some reviews at least).",
      "lmao its funny how you dont even get do try it. it doesnt even deserve a 1 star, there should be none. its really funny tbh. if it were to have like, 5 options, then it would have been way better, but unfortunately, there is nothing. i expected less anyways. it looked, like not sketchy but kinda. disappointed, but defs not surprised."

      "First of all, this is literally just a copy of another app, right down to the database and all that. So I was scrolling through youtube, watching the great WillNE, and I find an ad for this app. I am also subscribed to a person I found a year back called narpy (great content, check him out). I had watched his video on wholesome minecraft before, and definitely did not expect this app to blatantly rip the video off of his channel, and yet they did. If anybody reading can, shut this all down.",
      "This app is horrible. The mods work but are bad, and sometimes laggy(Could be my wifi). The ads for this are stolen videos from youtubers. They've stolen from Arcade cloud, Narpy(Who are good channels,check them out if you have time) and a couple more(I think i don't really know i've only seen a couple ads). I'd rate this half a star if i could. Don't download this it is so fricking bad!i!",
      "I like the mods I think but there's some problems I always wanted this mod dragon mod but it won't do I want to keep on searching stuff it just says it's not there it's not real so I don't know what to say I give this a tree star because does Haz texture packs that I like but I don't like when they texture the spiders so yeah if you're not like texture pack person and you want to have like mods I don't request this for you",
      "The mods work and all but what I have a problem with is the advertising for this game! They steal others videos and say there mods! When there clearly not! Like the Steve and Alex animation where they go into Steve's Dream that was stolen and used for a ad! This is lazy and terrible advertising! They don't even credit the animator who made it! And this is exactly the same as Addons for mcpe! They've stolen the entire layout and everything! This is a terrible app do not download it!!",
      "The add for this app looks a little promising . Let's see what this app is actually look like .If this app is nice then , I probably will use t many times because I am very big fan of MineCraft . So , I think if I like the app I will use it many times . I , think this review is a little promising So , yeah you can count on the votes for this one ."

Even your in videos advertisements are working phenomonally, but when it gets to the part i paid for the soundbyte goes out and its starting to make me angry. Im considering cancelling my subscription.",
      "The HBO app constantly kicks me out of the video saying they can't play the video, forces me to go back to then relaunch the video. I watched a movie where I had to do this about 50 times no joke, this is the most annoying Thing of this app. It would be one thing if it didn't happen on every show but it happens every single program I've ever watched and HBO since the moment I installed this app. I hope HBO has a fix for this because I can't believe I'm the only one that this is happening to",
      "Worst streaming service. Every interaction is frustrating. Too bad your burying good content with terrible ux. Rewind is frustrating. Navigating is frustrating. Getting kicked out is frustrating. Video quality is really bad. Loads forever. None of my other streaming apps do this I have solid fiber connection.",
      "I'm paying $25 a month so that ten minutes into a movie the app can stop working. Permanently. Turn the console off, uninstall the app, switch to a computer, it doesn't matter, the playback ends and won't go past the marker it first buffered at. And yes, it's across all my devices. I can watch Netflix, Hulu and Prime all in 4K but HBO, the most expensive one, crashes constantly. According to the help line, my internet download/upload and latency is more than DOUBLE what HBO requires to playback HD video. Their solution? To email me later when the \"app developers\" think of something. So answer me something. Why am I paying a monthly rate that is bonkers expensive compared to other streaming services for an app that quite actually has more buffering than a movie streaming site that will show me this title for FREE? The only thing this app has going for it is the original content which, while great, you can find anywhere else online with less buffering. And that doesn't cost you $25 a month.",
      "Frustrating interface that is not intuitive. No movie information page is available, it just immediately plays the movie with any touch, useless. Category organization is not employed unless an alphabetical only listing of every movie is the only category. Chromecast functionality appears to work."

      "It keeps kicking me off after the first few videos even after trying it on other better phones or even deleting it then re-downloading it.",
      "It is a very good app similar to youtube but all either fails or the best wins that you will not find on youtube i recommend this app to anyone who wants a good laugh or see awesone wins."

      "I installed this app to see if I could watch some of my favourites. When I pick a movie to watch it closes itself and says it has stopped. I have since uninstalled it, as I prefer my other movie app. I am always looking for new movie apps, this is not one of them. If I could give a zero star rating, then I would. This app is a waste of time and by my reckoning it will only get worse before it gets better. Don't download this app.",
      "Im only writing this review now..the same day as uploading the app & having not watched anything yet bcos review request keep popping up as im scrolling & adding to favourites. I. also being asked to upgrade to watch many movies. As stated above I havent watched anything yet. Why request upgrade when ive only just added the app? Make it make sense. No higher rating until I watch a movie.",
      "I onlywatch 3 movies but that's on now it won't even let me watch any movies because when I try to watch a movie just stays there and just what the picture and then tells me to go to another app but it does the same thing like what I just wanted to be a 5-star but it doesn't want to be a 5-star it's not trying to be what it wants it to be I just don't like this app anymore I'm going to delete it. and when I try to delete it it doesn't want to delete",
      "Loved it Be 4 the update . now it wont play anything at all uninstalled 3 times and reinstalled completely The only tjing i would Like to see is if you could add T.v Series . : like , THE WALKING DEAD , or Fear the WALKING DEAD, anything t.v related and more kids movies",
      "I wish it was a five star but some of the movies I pick say I have to go on to another app but when I try the movies on there it does not work and the sound quality is terrible but its awesome that u have trailers for what the movies are about. Thx"

      "!REVEIW! The app isn't that bad I wouldn't say awful but not it's not amazing. !SLIME! There's not much choices. And if you move your finger fast going round and round it looks really REALLY weird. And the slimes that look good they cost 1 -3 adds or they cost 250 çoins. !COINS/GETTING COINS! I know I should not be complaining about the coins but you have to a least wait 20-60 seconds to collect coins and you only start with 900. I hope you fix these things like adds. Thank you so much!",
      "Way to many slimes were locked even just decrease the amount of locked slimes by a tiny bit and I'll give you another star I've said this before I dont like coins in the slime when you poke a coin it creates a sound so you can't actually hear the slime please improve and I will change my review",
      "It lets you play with slime, but there is not much interaction besides tapping and swishing the slime around. There is also ads for me about another slime app, and not a lot of slime to choose from.",
      "This game is the best 👍💯 , I have play the fancy slime but it let me pay money. But this game is free and is fun you can make your own slime, also have a lot of option to let's you choose and play",
      "I totally recommend this game! It has jelly slime, butter slime, sticky slime, and more. The slime doesn't look realistic, but it moves realistically. My favorite feature of this game was the part where you can make slimes, you can add stuff, pick what kind of slime you want to make, and choose the colors. The only \"bad\" part is it has a bunch of ads. I totally recommend this game. 🙃"

      "Its meh, it has about 10 ads per episode, but they are at the very beginning and at the end, 5 at the start 5 at the end, so it's not that bad. Where else are you gonna watch anime for free? But my worst complaint is the buffering, it buffers like once every 2 or 3 minutes, and it takes around 10 seconds in total to stop. And I have pretty good internet. But if it wasn't that frequent or didnt exist, then I would very easily rate it 4 or 5 stars.",
      "I really like this streaming service, but on the phone app it is filled with issues. But my major problem is that it takes so damn long to load and still when it loads sometimes it stops in the middle of an episode, or the video stops and the audio goes back a few seconds and you have to wait for the audio to catch up. And in pc you have none of these problems, so I always keep thinking, why pay for this since you can just go on pc and use an adblocker. I am really frustrated with this app.",
      "The app really has a problem. Whenever I click on any video, the app tells me that its stopped working and that I need to reload. I've uninstalled and installed the app multiple times and the problem still won't go away. I really want to watch anime when I'm not at home but can't because Crunchyroll has \"stopped working\". I'm not even going to try anymore. Maybe get that fixed, please. However, this is a great place to watch all of your favorites for free and you get new episodes really quick :)",
      "I enjoy the app for the most part and I love the selection. Although I cannot go a single day without there being constant loading and buffering issues. There are apps like the Netflix one that I've never had an issue with, but does the same thing as this one... stream shows. It baffles me as to how this problem has yet to be fixed after reading so many others who also have this issue. I just want to be able to watch my shows without it constantly stopping and starting. First world problems aye.",
      "Nice app...when you actually get to watch it. Ads in a free version are fine, when they work. A 25 sexond ad takes about 2 minutes as it buffers constantly. Some ads run fine. Some of them need me to restart the episode as they just don't play. It's not every ad by the way. The figurine site ad works fine, but the insurance one freezes at about the 6 second mark for example. Pretty sure it isn't my connection as well. Otherwise the app works as intended."

Sometimes there are multiple programs i want to watch and want to be able to somehow mark them to find later or I don't have time to finish watching something and want to pick up where I left off later, but doesn't seem I can do that....? Seems odd not to have that feature?",

Devs: work on those IN-VIDEO controls, and general usability and functionality, please, You can't, for instance, simply transition from small window to full screen and back fluidly! I want to have a video playing, and be able to continue browsing your content! Also, we need background app support here, asap, for multi-tasking whilst staying on the pulse, and audio only options, aswell, for a bit of \"Rick while you Run!\" suggestion would be hourly one minute updates",

I give it a year for this app to boom or die, to be YT killer app or being mothballed like Friendster Edit: if they can incorporate alternative / smaller media like The Duran, Empire Files, Jimmy Dore etc, it'd be lit like christmas trees; or work with ads, i don't mind, just don't be gluttony like YT"

      "I've been member of Gamefly for over 8 years. Worth the investment in my opinion. But this app bugs me... Only about half of the titles load picture of the covers or play the video of the game when clicked on. It's a minor annoyance but being like this for the past couple years for me has finally drove me to review about it. #RantOver",
      "The app works perfectly fine... But if you wondering if you should subscribe to Gamefly: Takes 5-10 days to receive games. I've received the 3 un-readable discs in a row, where I was without a game for nearly 20 days. Support team said they apologize. Games aren't checked before sending, clearly visible scratches on top and bottom of disc's received. I don't think my experience with gamefly could be any worse. Failure of an operation. Avoid if you value money/time/entertainment.",
      "Horrible customer service. First of all I didn't get my first game until almost 2 weeks after signing up. I wanted to change my plan and they told me I couldn't, however a customer service agent told me to just cancel and make another account. Which I did but then was told by someone ELSE, I couldn't. Get it together. I'm done. I'll keep my money.",
      "Just had the worst experience with GameFly. A previous roommate had service which apparently makes me ineligible to use the free trial to see if I would enjoy the service. I spoke with a manager about this unfair policy and all they could tell me was because someone I used to live with had the service I am ineligible. Ive never used the service, I never played a game with my former roommate, and I was hoping to try out the service to see if i would enjoy it. This was the worst customer service",
      "Awesome service! Especially so you can try a game before you purchase! I've wasted a lot of $ buying games, then realized I didn't like them!"

      "I give this app one star because you can only read part of a story unless you subscribe. The free trial cost $69.00 plus tax a year. The free trial is only good for one week wast of money if you ask me. There are no adds. I only recommend this app if you like a terrible app and unfair deals. If you download this app your not going to be having a good time unless you spend $69.00 plus tax.",
      "Worst app ever first of all the app picks a story for you. After it picks that story for you you can't look at the pictures, go to the next chapter, or read a different one. You have to have a membership that is $69.99 per year. How dumb do you have to be to pay that much for fake texts when there is something on snapchat that does the same thing for free. Would rate it zero stars if I could.",
      "It only let's you read one episode and then you have to pay for the rest. This app is a waste of time, I think the story's could be good but not worth the money. I hope they can fix this otherwise no one will download this app. Do not download this app, in my opinion it's really not worth it.",
      "The reason why i gave two stars is because the app was really fun while the free trial was going on but as soon as i cancled because im not paying 70$ for a stupid game it didnt work at all not worth the trouble of installing and uninstalling why have a 'free' app if its not really free",
      "I HATE IT no wonder this app has bad ratings you cant even finish the whole season it's so BAD I absolutely hate it.. sooo let me get this straight you clearly want money and dont care about us!?!?!?! 1 STAR and if there was a rating that you had the choice to pick no stars THAT WOULD BE YOU STUPID \"YARN\" I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT"

      "They say give 250 new members 1 year free to gain new members interest.. Goal hopefully is to prove to be as great as Netflix or Hulu but they want a credit card on file to even open a account but say it won't be charged..well there are so many scams out there now and after trying to trust some other apps and getting burned. I believe that if your going give a free trail period than make it end after trail date and have a pop up screen letting you know that your on your 5 day countdown waiting $",

      "This app is great I love it! I believe it's real but I am not sure 🤷. Well in my house I found 2 gohsts that are really nice, I forgot their name, but yea they were both a girl and really sweet! But there is something wrong with it, the thing wrong with it is that they don't let you pick your own question so I'm thinking it's fake. If you fix that mistake 100 stars!!!",
      "It's so obviously fake, the ghost keep floating around my screen and won't stay in one place. Even when the radar does pick up anything, half of it doesn't show up. I'm really disappointed.",
      "It's fake, and it looks through your files without consent, I checked the background permissions it has and it even has contacts and Facebook activity. I looked over the code and it showed a line of code that makes it so you can't find a ghost unless you purchase the \"pro version.\" Long story short, your phone doesn't have the capabilities to detect ghosts, you would need special sensors. It's fine if you got it has a joke, but if you think it's real, sorry but it's not.",
      "I was in my room and I wanted to play this game but I saw it wasn't going to be that scary so I turn off my light but when I get tired don't need to turn off my lights but when I turned around I got jump scared it's the ghost fault I could have break my phone how dare you ghost I'm not afraid of the ghost dumb ghost you will regret it I'm going to kill you <:("

      "I love the voice!! LOVE 🤩😍😍😍😍😍 However, I like the old app where you could vote in real time. I have to wait until the person sings and then it is into the next performance before that person shows as someone I can vote for....so I miss that option. Also, I like to see the teams and the layout makes me go through several steps to get there now. Other than that, I enjoy seeing how close I get to the top 3!",
      "Love this app BUT when I watch live and play along, the red button always shows a couple minutes BEFORE the performance starts. Then I'm rushed to make a decision. Sometimes, I don't get the button at all. Same with who they choose as a coach, the app tells me before the show does. Disappointing in that. Otherwise I love the app.",
      "It is the best since the show started. I actually feel as though I'm part of the show. Although the thought did run across my mind about the ability to block but maybe that wouldn't make sense. How about being able to send the judges a kiss for an accomplishment. BTW... The Voice is my favorite show on television. I have never missed a show. I love you guys, Jack",
      "Since I've updated my iPad to 13.1.3 the app doesn't work correctly. It freezes and takes 30 or more times to finally get into it. I've restarted the iPad several times before I could get into the app, then it still takes several times to work. Update:. The latest version of the voice app works again on my iPad. Yay!!",
      "I love the Voice!!!! I love that people get picked on their Voice and not race, color, religion, sex, or appearance. I get more excited to watch the people perform and see what they learn from being on the Voice. My son and I pick who we think are going to win. I'm ready to start picking my favorite artist!!!! I love The Voice!!! ❤❤❤❤"

      "I have found this to be the best app for watching anime seeing as how it doesn't have about 20 ads before every episode and halfway through them like crunchyroll, I read a comment that it closes after every episode randomly and I found that if you click your phone's back button to leave full screen then go back a page that tends to be why you are leaving the app so just leave fullscreen by double tapping on the episode or click the button in the bottom left, than you can click the back button",
      "I like this app. This is the best,not much Ad. Full and complete episodes. I have been looking for like this app for many times, but I did not fine. Now this app is what I have been looking for to watch anime since I'm anime fun😄. I really glad to found this app and using it. Thank you.........",
      "Very amazing! Btw i have a question, do your animes have 8D In them? Whenever i watch naruto and a song starts playing in the background, i can feel the audio swtiching from ear to ear while prefectly matching the rhythm of the song. Pretty neat. Plus please add an exit button, its not annoying since like 80% of the time when i exit it doesnt exot me out of the app but please add one.",
      "It's been working great so far, it doesn't stall too much except for maybe in the beginning og the episode for a few seconds, but then it's fine. My internet is really slow so the fact that it works that well from my room (other apps have trouble) is great.",
      "I would reccomend this anime app because it doesn't ask you to pay to watch quality anime. You can also just open the app to see your anime list. But one downside to this app is whenever I would finish a episode, I would try to exit, only to completely close the app. But I dont mind a FEW SECONDS to load my next episode."

      "Great app! Honestly under rated. Only thing I would change is add the ability to listen to the calls live. That's a lot of fun.",
      "It works, I've used it on 3 different people. It records the call too. Some of the pranks are good some aren't. It would be better if there were more. But for free prank app, it's worth it to give it shot. My gf dropped her son off at daycare and theres a \"your kid bit another kid and you need to come get him\" the timing on it couldnt have been better on my part.",
      "Nice app until you run out of free credits. Personally, i feel like the credit packages to pay for are way too expensive for what this is. I might have bought them if they were cheaper. Also kind of a bummer they wont let you save the reactions off the app.",

      "Good shows, glitchy app. \"Sorry, we are unable to load this stream.\" I get that a lot. I love these shows when the app actually works. It's not my wifi or phone. Because everything else on my phone works. And sometimes it just randomly loses connection. Disappointing. Acorn TV does work on my desktop TV, however. Is there. Setting I'm overlooking?",
      "Buffers every 30s secs the last couple of days...so frustrating!!!! I am still on my 7 day trial so can't say if this is normal or not. It never happens with any of my other streaming apps so I know it is not my device. Also it rarely seems to be able to start a show from where it left and doesn't always recognise an episode has been watched.",
      "The Acorn programming is great but the app is very poor. Here are a couple of the problems I have with the app: When casting to my TV I have to start the program on the app then cast it, otherwise the cast attempt fails. The \"recently watched\" section of the app lists the same two shows for months even though I have watched several dozen shows by now. The app doesn't keep track of the episodes that you've watched in a series, so you have to figure out which episode is next every time you watch.",
      "Theifs!!! They will give you a free trial for week, like most things you give them your card information so they can charge you after the free trial. However contrary to following their instructions there's no way to cancel. I tried to cancel on my phone cancel on my computer add to cancel through your fire TV those instructions and it gives you no ability to what does is let you sign out at the top of it. Also they claim that their customer service can't cancel your account for you. Fraud fraud",
      "Not impressed at all. Is there a point to even telling you. I've tried contacting you and apparently not email to you will not send. I cant get anything from the app \"sorry cant stream or load\" is the standard message I get. If I cant access so.ething I'm paying you for then what is the point. This nonsense has happened before. I get no help, no way of contacting you. Not even sure u will get this either. So basically I'm paying \"acorn\" for absolutely nothing."

I need to catch up on a couple episodes, please help.",

      "An absolutely horrible app. By far the worst for streaming that I have ever seen. I've made multiple complaints about app shut downs and other issues. I have received zero feedback and there has been no resolution in many months. If it weren't for one show I wouldn't use this app any more. Good thing it's the final season of that show so I can immediately delete this app when it's over. DO NOT GET THIS APP! It is horrible to use. And the support is just as horrible. ZERO STARS!",
      "Lots of shows for free, just not the current seasons always. They are locked unless you pay for a separate cable package subscription of some sort for your home television. I enjoy watching past seasons though. Shows stream smoothly on my LG STYLO 4.",
      "Every time I try to watch anything..it spins circles.. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. Very frustrating.",
      "Does not work. I put in my login information from my network provider, it across them, but then it gets stuck on the login screen and does not allow me to move on to view the content.",
      "Every time I touch it to go back a few minutes I'm forced to watch an ad. The ads last forever!"

      "There is a RIDICULOUS amount of ads in each episode you watch. Not worth your time. When you have to watch 5-9 commercials per interruption and you're interrupted 3-5 times each episode...it's ridiculous. And if you try and skip forward or backward during regular play, you get to do it all again. Can't skip ads either and they automatically sell your info unless you go into the settings and check a box not to",
      "The ads were annoying enough, but now (watching on Chromecast) my phone gets a notification, buzzes, and blocks my screen at the start and end of ads. This interfere with anything I'm doing and adds no value. Moreover it regularly says no connection when there is one, and it can even connect to the Chromecast on my wifi. I'll be deleting the app, and watching with adblocker on web.",
      "I screenshot the shows to my television. I just wish they would have the entire current season of a show, like Riverdale. I'm late to the party I guess. Lol. I haven't had any issues thus far. Also I wish the ads would only play at the beginning and end of the show instead of throughout. They do keep the ads short.",
      "Use to be the best casting app. Now its the worse. Biggest thing, it blows up ur phone with notifications while casting. Every new commercial, pause, play, fast forward, rewind, etc, it sends 1 to 3 loud notifications to ur phone with every action, easily close to 100 notifications per show. You have to silent ur phone. Very annoying. Then it doesnt remember where u left off. Then skips to the next episode. Have to watch 10min of commercials to find where u left off. Note 9. Chromecast Ultra 4k.",
      "This app allowed me to watch the episodes of supergirl, legends of tomorrow and batwoman to name a few that was perfect viewing; not like when I tried to watch them with my dvr where I had been experiencing since Sunday March 01, 2020 I think I was having this problem even in February and my wife even let me know that she has been experiencing these same problems on her TV Pixelation, picture and audio breakup (pausing and missing words) on the CW - WTTOD • 9 (Still happening even now.)"

      "It's incredibly fun to build especially when you buy the upgrade. I wish they'd add a few more guns, especially pistols. But what they have is very very detailed.",
      "Great app BUT...could we possibly get some new firearms? I'd like to see some 19 or 2011's, more AK parts, maybe a Mosin or mil surplus stuff? I'd definitely rate 5 then, but all in all it's a great app.",

      "I really enjoy recolor and it's the best app I've used, the only down fall is the cost now to use all the colors and pictures.. I can't afford to subscribe at almost $15.00 a month and I would love to be able to enjoy the whole app.. It would be great to take our minds off this event and all the craziness going on, but yes it's a great app if you like coloring and there are some real artists on here...🤗🎨",
      "This game is definitly amazing, I would recomend trying it! My only dislike about Recolor is that, you have to be premium to do a lot of things, you have to be premium for certain pictures, types of effects, and colors. It would be better if yoy brought down the lack of premium things! Other than that, Recolor is a perfect app for when you are bored, and when you dont really feel like doing anything XD. Recolor is a must download.",
      "Love love love Recolor. My mother has been using for years and got me hooked around summer 2019. The pictures are beautiful the colors are vivid the tools easy to use. And thats not all, the community of artist is amazing, everyone supporting each other no matter the skill level. Anyone can enjoy this app. I love the flexiablity of starting and stopping my art project anytime, without the worry of clean up. But all this does come with a price, extra colors cost and the app crashes now and again.",
      "The pictures are really amazing and the coloring itself is really satisfying! Unfortunately in order to color the free pictures you have to watch an ad? I understand as a business you need to get money but when it starts to become your entire app something needs to change. I appreciate the app itself good job on that! I honestly wouldn't mind a couple ads but all of the free pictures having ads? Anyway thank yall for responding to other user's comments! I'm definitley open to corrections!",
      "Love this app but recently it's started deleting my progress. Normally I'll color a little on a piece and step away for a while, closing the app out to save battery, then come back later to finish my work. But now, sometimes, when I open a half-colored picture back up, it's suddenly blank, as if I've done nothing to it. So that's not cool, as well as the allowance of images clearly not colored in the app by some users, but other than that I like it. Great variety of pictures."

Also the ads between videos are too obstructive. The videos themselves need proper categorisation, as some are just thrown out there. Summary: If you want to binge-watch some great animation, you have to put up with far too many adds.",
      "It is honestly a great app. But there are 2 problems; 1) the search function is not user friendly. There is no filtering. 2) the videos load so much more slowly than other apps. You can try using the same internet connection, and watch multiple sources at once, and this app will still be the slowest.",
      "Works alright, thumbs up. Same content as KissAnime. Yes it does have ads but they only appear sometimes before and after watching episodes, not after each or during an episode. It does freeze occasionally but i just go back and restart the episode and it works. Or just close the app and reopen and it works good. Best free anime app aside from KissAnime.",
      "The app is great and convenient, the quality of the streaming is good...however there are still some stuff that can be worked on. 1: Adding the appropriate anime cover art when you add a show to your list instead of just seeing the name. 2: I couldn't skip when I'm watching an episode so this has to be fixed. 3: keep getting the option of downloading the manga app (which I did btw) but it gets annoying every time you get the notification when you enter the app.",
      "I like the app. When it bloody works. I've been watching Psycho Pass for the last couple days and it's been enjoyable for the most part. But every once in a while, the episodes refuse to queue up. And restarting my phone won't help fix it either. I just got a new phone (the ROG II), so I know it's not the phone and I know it's not my service provider."

      "I've been using netflix for a while now. Most of the times i download shows so I can watch while on the go. But the thing that is hassle now is I can't even watch anything now. Not even my downloaded content. Also my bill is recurring so I hope it gets fixed right away. When I select a show that I want to watch is says \"The title is not available to watch instantly\", then on the downloaded content \"there is a problem. please try again later.\" Idk if it's just me? anyone also experiencing this?",
      "Good app for new shows and movies, I will be keeping it. If you are looking for older tv shows Hulu is the way to go. With both I feel like I have plenty of options. I have not tried amazon prime so cannot comment on that. No matter what you get there will always be that one show that you will have to sign up for Starz, HBO, Showtime, etc in order to watch but overall with netflix and hulu along with a 3 hour window a day to watch tv I feel like there is plenty to keep me busy.",
      "My first day and I've already had show's stopped till I picked the tablet up and assured Netflix I was still watching... about a dozen times. If you plan to grab something from the fridge or go to the bathroom, etc. expect your show to be stopped...and if really slow the app to lose your place. Haven't decided if this will be worth it or not. I will update in a few days if this is an everyday acurance when streaming. The content is good. Just not user friendly/convenient.",
      "I just changed my device three days ago and I re-downloaded the Netflix app. Since then Netflix has been saying \"can't reach the Netflix service\"! This is beyond infuriating as my subscription is wasting and I can't even use the money I have paid for. I need this fixed as soon as possible. I can't even log in via browser. I can't even reach your customer care either because they are not allowing me to call. Fix this!!! I am using a Tecno Spark 4 Air.",
      "I love the series the good place but i found out that theres a fourth season. Netflix doesnt have it along with many other shows i watched Netflix makes you wait a year until you can watch the next season. Other than that there arnt any adds or any other reason not to like it. But when you go to update it, Netflix doesn't tell you what its updating."

The only reason I'm giving this an actual opportunity to have another star is because it has new good movies. Like for instance, Frozen II, Annabelle Comes Home, and It: Chapter II. I totally do not recommend this unless you want a buffering movie/ video. 😣😔"

      "Great quality, very little ads, hardly any buffering, am very satisfied with this app. A dream come true for movie lovers who wanna watch their movies on their phones. My only suggestion would be that it would make it even way better, if there are more 80s and 90s films, rather than just the commonly known films. Don't get me wrong, this app has a great selection of films but I'd love to watch more films from those eras. I usually don't write a review but this app is worth rating for 👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "Very good app brilliant to use and very user friendly. The search button is a great feature as a lot of the apps that I have tried don't have a search button. I also really like the ability to download movies - this makes long car journeys a lot less boring! The only downside is that some movies aren't on there such as back to the future 2 & 3. If I could see these films added it would be a definite 5 star review. Great little app. 👍",
      "I really didnt expect it to have as many movies as they do! There are so many GOOD movies and soo many better ones than majority of these other free apps. My son and i love this app. Lots and lots and lots to chose from. There is one movie i havent came across yet that i would LOVE to see, \"P.S. I Love You\"... Any way u guys can add it to the app?",
      "It's cool because I can watch movies that had come out like the Joker 2019 movie but it's annoying when it adds random movie that you haven't even watched to the \" recently watched\" category, and then sometimes you have to do something with the add below to watch the movie but it's an ok app",
      "Its very hard to find a loyal app like this one, free to download and watch HD movies like *720p* OR *1080p* and its amazing with 1 or 2 ads, its just so perfect just the app im looking for, like no other words can explain it. Thanks To the developers, keep up the good work!"

      "Sony owns Funimation yet the funimationNow android tv app broke the internal sound on my Sony Bravia x850g where I could not hear sound out of my TV nor would it export sound to my Sony receiver. The only way I could get sound to return was doing a factory reset on my TV. Uninstalling the app didn't help. How do I know the app was the culprit? I had to do a factory reset twice. When reinstalling the funimation app and playing a video the second time I lost my internal tv sound both through it's speaker and outputting to my receiver. I used the android tv app because at least it autoplayed episodes and kept my subtitle language settings unlike the mobile app. This is just a warning to others. Funimation doesn't read these reviews because if they did they would solve these problems.",

Why is it ads are extremely loud, movie or shows are audible. If turned all the way up? 3. I keep getting empty url messages after 5 episodes or movies? 4. Tv series should roll over to the next episode, show where we stoppe I have to uninstall then reinstall then update, again and again. Why? Like i said good"

      "I love this app. I got irritated when i had to reinstall it, and when I tried to play a movie, a message popped up saying \"you need to have a subscription to watch this content.\" I thought I had a subscription? Unfortunately, you can't check or sign up inside the app. You have to have to go to the website! Still, Where else are you going to find wholesome, pro-God, pro American content? Not on TV and not in the movies. Lots of good shows!",
      "I was having an issue with my account, turns out I was using the wrong email to sign in. After having to reach out to the company through email ( it would have been better customer service if they would ha e emailed me 1st) I got several robotic emails, suggesting I read articles that ended up not being useful. After continuing to respond negatively to the emails, eventually a real person looked at my issue and was able to tell me the solution. I changed my 1 star rating to a 4 b/c like the app",
      "I had to cancel my membership at the website. And (it's not my phone) but the page wouldn't load. The it wouldn't let me login. So I had to re do everything and still it wouldn't load. When it finally did it took forever. Why can't you make changes on the app itself?? And 12.99 a month is a little expensive when I can get Netflix and hulu for cheaper and have the same stuff. Not going tell anyone about this app as it sucks.",
      "It won't even let me login to the app, it keeps saying it's having trouble connecting to the internet, but all my other apps, including my internet access, is working just fine. I go onto the pure flix web page and it's incredibly slow. I try looking at other pages.. Facebook, Google inbox, news pages via internet and all other pages work fine. Not sure what's up with this, but I'm not going to pay for something that I can't use. I even tried uninstalling it. It's still giving me trouble.",
      "I love what their doing here BUT, there are some MAJOR issues that need fixing. If I have a movie or show paused for 5 mins to go change my babies diaper when I come back it says \"streaming problem\" or something like that and wont let me continue. Its not my internet connection because it does this with any service. And theres no continuing watching option (also another issue that should be looked at) so I have to go out, come back to the it and search all over again. Plz look into it. Thank you"

      "It streams more consistantly with less buffering than this same app for Samsung.....until it doesn't . When it doesn't work it's incredibly frustrating and takes forever to be recognized by the Firestick. I come from a place of good outweighs the bad, but when it glitches it's HORRIBLE. I still use it daily, unless it's in a mood.",
      "This app is great with movies and videos... sometimes it needs to warm up but other than that it is great..and easy connection not like other app where you need to fuss just to get it started....",
      "No use for me even if it was free but it is not!!! Cost $10 while there are plenty of free ones.My first daft step was buying this one thinking must be a really good one if they can get away charging that much. WRONG!!!. Finally got their email. I am not sure if I'm the daft or the app is the daft one. Casting from S9 to Firestick is a bunch of convoluted steps with no result. Should come with a casting button so dafts could use it too. I'm just browsing with Fire tv using YouTube premium.",
      "Used to work perfectly but now it won't cast my movies. It says it's connected to my fire stick but won't display, I've tried uninstalling it and installing it several times, but still the same issue.",
      "I am beyond satisfied with this app, I had to of downloaded at least 6 or 7 other screen mirroring apps that simply either didn't work at all or would not find the videos in my web browser. It took me about 2 minutes to learn how to navigate this app, and I didn't even have to connect it to my Amazon TV stick it did it automatically."

I like the game a lot, not a fan of the lack of clothing choices, though what is there looks nice. I'm not a fan the constant ads, after every coin redeem, and the fact that whenever you click off, your met with the membership page. Great customization game otherwise",
      "This is very fun because you get to create your own avatar person however you want. Also you can put their own makeup however you want also your favorite hairstyle just spell the type of hairstyle you would like and over 200 results would come out so this game is super recommended if you're ever bored.",

      "(i recommen a better app to use below) On the add i saw for this app it said you can use it with out wifi, but that is not the case. Plus when i do have wifi it won't load any songs. I will even use my moble data too, but it still doesn't work. Honestly this app is not worth downloading. If you want an app that i think works pretty well i would say Aduiomac is really good. I recommen that app insted off this. This app is not good, but i appreciate the attempt in making a music app. Thank you!",
      "It is not movable to the SD Card which is a must for any app. It was advertised as being a offline music player, however it does seem to have that capability, it did not seem to detect my files. Also, while it is not the fault of the music player, seems to be not exactly what I am looking for which is a simple MP3 player. A lot of online content. Mostly just a run of the mill music player but that SD card issue made my rating lose a star as well as the irregular local file incapability.",
      "This app has adware in it!!! I kept getting annoying add pop ups on my phone, but it does not tell you it is this app. These ads pop up on top of every app I use even when mega music is not open. I finally figured it out by going to the play store and changing my installed apps from \"alphabetical\"to \"most recently used\" every time the add popped up this app would jump to the top of my most recently used apps.",
      "It's definitely one of the better music apps. You don't need to be in the app, basically every song I can think of. And still a really great app without premium. My only complaint is that the ads constantly pop up even if the app isn't up. (I got like 3 ads while wrighting this review)",
      "I got this app to listen to music. Not to have an add pop up every five seconds. When I'm not on Mega Music, an add pops up and it makes me so mad. And when I'm trying to listen to music I can't even play one song because of how long it takes to load. I don't recommend this app.😤"

      "Worst app ever! My cousin was happy to see that I was downloading the app for her, until she opened it up. First of all, it took ages to load and second thing was that when it finally loaded, it showed an error message. I rebooted my device a trillion times, and even uninstalled the app and re opened it, but it still showed the error message that it has \" unfortunately \" stopped. To all the people reading this review, please do not download this wastage of space of time. Very bad experience.",
      "I always loved this game, but now it got terrible! Tom's voice is slower and Ben's voice is faster. I cannot change the fighting scene because when I press it, all buttons dissapear. If anyone has the old version, don't update this app!",
      "Kinda funny when i press the swords button. Try it out! It will be funny at the first, but a censor at the end. Lower your media/volume down if you wanna try.",
      "I kinda like it. The problem is only Ben can do stuff to tom. And the cool stuff you have to pay for. So if you're expecting tom to be using a water gun your gonna have to pay for it. So I'm saying this calmly, I ADVISE YOU DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!😠",
      "Awsome! Super funny and really good if u r bored. Quick idea I'd like to type in what you want them to say then they say it! Just an idea. Any way it's a fun game! 😀"

      "I used to like this app but knowing all the rushed ads being on screen at the same time is inferior to my taste, also forcing me to pay a single SINGLE in-app penny or dime on its subscription service won't do anything. Not a single thing to change this review, though i do love the increased potential on this sorry excuse for a screen mirroring application, fixing this issue may help bring up a few more stars on this review. Mitchell merits i might add.",
      "Several tries and it is not working. Probably need to be purchased version first but why do I have to pay an app even I could not see its performance well.",
      "Would pay for it, if there wasn’t be only a subscription option... deleted, and paid to the competitors...",
      "The app is exceptionally good except the forced ads that stay on the screen until user interacts. That's ultra infuriating & discomforting for you right there. I want to buy it but the developer only offers the horrible subscription model which is very unfortunate. The closed captions are overlapping on YouTube and I wish brightness and volume to be controlled like VLC. I would give this a 5 star if I could buy it permanently instead of crapppy subscription model",
      "I don't understand all the negative reviews about this app. It's a lifesaver and it works flawlessly. I purchased a subscription and i use it on 4 different machines. This works great! If you want to have Chromecast support be sure to enable it in settings. :) update 03/2019: I still use this app heavily, and it is as awesome as ever. It's good to see that all the reviews for the past few months are all genuine and they are all positive! Keep up the good work and thank you again for making this"

Where are the rest of the pictures and what's going to happen with my monthly fee? Don't want to continue paying for no pictures.",
      "I have seizures and they make it hard for me to focus on things, but this makes it a little easier to follow and stay focused on what I'm doing. The only thing I would change is being able to change the colors if I don't like the ones that are given just to make more enjoyable. But it's still a great game.",

      "A very nice app in the free streaming service category. It has a very good selection for my age demographic. I am, however, only giving 4 stars because it lacks one feature for use on my device: there is no way to clear the \"Continue Watching\" feature. Sometimes you may begin a movie or show that you don't want to continue (because you've changed your mind once it began). How do you clear that feature? Please fix this and I'll gladly add the final star.",
      "Interface is fine for a free streaming app. 8 commercials per movie is tolerable considering how, again, it's free. That being said, is it really too much to ask that I'm able to enjoy what I'm streaming? The ads conveniently play perfectly every time. The movie/TV part however, not so much. My screen kept freezing as audio continues to play and then turns green. This happened several times within the first 20 minutes of just one movie. I'm sorry, but that makes it unbearable to watch.",
      "Seemed to be okay at first my first time watching a movie, that is until I experienced the ads. I'm not opposed to some ads by any means, it is free after all. The problem is they run choppy, sometimes out of sync with voice. The time doesn't match up. It will go back to the movie for 3 seconds, then go back to the ads all over again as if I hadn't watched the ads at that interval yet. After what was supposed to be like 1 minute of ads to continue watching, I was really at 3 or 4 minutes.",
      "ZERO STARS. I tried watching movies on CRACKEL but VOLUME LEVEL WAS SO LOW~ ~>Icouldnt even HEAR THE MOVIE enough to tell what was going on. Maddening!. I used the closed captioning because I am severely hearing-impaired CLOSED CAPTIONING. It's not enough I can hear well enough to watch movies other apps! If that wasn't enough when the ads came on it blasted me out of my seat and I had to move my phone over 2 feet away from ME it was SO DARN LOUD! If you're handicapped, I highly advise against",
      "Woof. All I can say is... This is bad. They've got a great selection of titles that are unique and would be wonderful to watch... If the UI wasn't so, incredibly and painstakingly BAD. Want to stream from your phone to smart TV? Good luck. Did you get distracted from your show to read this review? Well you're not even able to rewind. It's THAT bad. I'm not sure if this is supposed to resemble a Netflix competitor or a cable company from 1997 before we had the luxury of a DVR. What a shame."
