      "The user interface is just fine. Pretty standard for something like this. Nothing special and nothing bad. HOWEVER!!! As soon as I sign up, I start getting telemarketer calls. I went from having 1 or 2 a week to 10 a day. They will sell your info even if you uncheck the boxes to not share. Those boxes only keep Eventbrite from filling your email with garbage. Keep this in mind when buying from them or making a profile.",
      "Love this app! It's helped me discover so many more events in London - the \"free stuff only\" is great too! However, they really need to add more filters such as price and distance ranges, see events on a map, sort by what's closest to you etc. as some searches come back with thousands of results! Still highly recommend this app though :)",
      "This app is great for finding events, but one point I would like to address, is that since events occur in cities, there is no need for the grainy location to be provided, such as when searching, adding Amman will provide different results from the location it chose for me, which is Balqa, which they are close to each other. So just giving a broader way of searching could be better and provide better results, as I found some difficulties browsing events.",
      "\"Meh.\" I've been using Eventbrite for over a decade ... The app? User experience is oversimplified, to the point of uselessness. You cannot \"follow\" a performer or venue, you can't even search for a venue or town, even if THEY ARE LISTED in events. Waste.",
      "I can't log into the app to see my ticket purchase, all it does is send me emails (7 to be exact) to change my password and nothing happens when I do change it. I had to reach out to the promoter of the event just to make sure I can use the email I received to verify my ticket purchase."

      "While trying to create a account only two options provided Either we can sign up with our facebook account?? (or) We can sign up with google account?? There should be a manual option to sign up something creepy, why you guys need our social signals to create a account in your database why not manually filling? Once provided the next prompt will be accessing of our friends list, once accessing the friends list dam you will make ads and encouraging to sign up more 😉 if I am not wrong 😊 😜",
      "Not very well thought out. If you search on today's events, esp. on Saturday morning, you'll see loads of nightlife that finished in the early hours of the morning. That's no use to someone who wants to see what to do TODAY. It's a huge waste of time filtering out those past events.",

      "Wow, Just wow. Rarely have I seen such a bad; slow, unintuitive app. It's mind boggling slow in simple screens. It's unintuitive, you have to star speakers instead of tracks you want to follow. Even the app name is bad on you home screen. This is atrocious, made by utter amateurs with no idea about good UX design or app development, every bad practice has been done. 0 stars if possible.",
      "Absolutely unusable - I wish the Conference organisers had done their homework and NOT gone with this app as unable to access content and when contacting customer support there seems to be no help available - sent around in circles and nothing gained - only lots of time lost!!!",
      "The app was helpful at the event, however once the event is over it will not let you access the notes. Very disappointed and upset to lose all my notes! They should notify you that you must export the notes before the end of the event by email or notification. I would give it more stars, but since I would have been much better off not using it, it gets 1 star. I have reached out to the developer. If they can recover my notes, I will update my rating.",
      "I'm not sure why this app isn't higher rated. I thought it was very useful tool for the conference I attended. Could be a little better structured, but simple enough.",
      "App keeps freezing, getting a message that it is not responding. There seems to be a bug on the section where one can access the attendees' list - after one alphabet letter has been scrolled, it constantly jumps back to surnames starting with \"de\", then it freezes and gives the error message. Very frustrating."

      "The app seems okay, it's just the entire concept of Meetup seems to be dying in the areas I frequent. I've been on Meetup since 2013 and the group selection is nowhere near as good as it used to be. I know that's not really Meetup's fault but it's still indicative of a decline in popularity. I doubt I'll keep it installed much longer.",
      "What's happened to Explore? Distance filter gone, so you can't specify range of 5,10,25,40 km anymore? Order by Date gone, so it defaults to Order by Recommended, and you can't see events ordered by time through the day, gone? Those 2 features weren't optimal before (couldn't be saved, and had to be set each time) but now they're just gone? Is this a bad joke? It's the equivalent of replacing Windows 7 with Windows 8. Why?",
      "Meetup is great heaps of knowledge and help within stranger interaction on different topics within the community. I find the app good as it gives detail on the Meetup, messages and questions from people attending the Meetup and a rating after you attend the meetup letting other people on quality of the meetup. One thing that is a bugger on this app is applying your interests to your profile. For the meetups which are of interest to be emailed. Otherwise i have to search manually.",
      "Although I am having trouble with some of the settings and navigating and finding out what email address I have .(the platform is somewhat difficult to manage on my android.) ... the intent is fantastic and it's helped bring together so many great people with like-minded needs and those who might have trouble meeting up out socially..",
      "Buggy, unreliable, misses the point. The comment system in the events is amateurish to be kind, easily breaking a conversation. The application keeps on trying to clutter your main view with all meetup on your zone. Let's be clear about one thing I KNOW what I LIKE. I will search accordingly, mind your own business. It is the Facebook of the meeting applications, you do not wabt to use it, but all your frirbds are there."

      "Great app. Conference attendees were able to send messages to each other, using this app, share photos, suggest topics for discussion, suggest great local places and events to attend, ask the conference coordinator questions, and a host of other features. We had fun using this app. I would recommend Whova conference app to any organization hosting a conference.",
      "This is an awesome app! I've used other apps for tracking agendas and sessions and viewing attendees, but this is probably the most engaging one I've used. I love being able to see attendees AND find meaningful ways to engage before the conference even starts. This has definitely made me more excited for the conference I will be attending soon.",
      "This app was wonderful in navigating my schedule through our recent NCCA event. My agenda had up to date information about break out training, number of attendees, and even last minute room changes. It was useful to network with the attendees on the app itself; asking and answering questions, swapping contact info, engaging in group discussion, etc. I enjoyed being able to complete the in-app session evaluation as well! Suggestion: allow presenters to add handouts/materials to follow in app",
      "Great Conference Network Mechanism! Used this app during my conference last week! Loved the ability to network before, during and after the conference with everyone registered! It was fun! It was easy! It was competitive too! Collecting points to be in the Top 10 ranking! Hope Crawford will use this app for all future conferences!",
      "At first I was annoyed at the thought of yet another app! However, after installing it I found it to be easy to use and indeed valuable to me as an attendee. I was able to chat and meetup with many people I wouldn't have found otherwise. Also, I loved the agenda feature. Before leaving Podfest 2020, I sent an email to the organizers of another event I'm scheduled to attend in May and recommended that they consider Whova in their planning. Gloria D."

      "The concept of the app is great! I would give it 5 stars, but there's one major flaw. When I select a date to view events, it still shows me events from other days, including events from the day before where it's physically impossible to even go to! If I wanted to look at events for other days, I would select those dates! Common sense. It just gets very annoying.",
      "I used to love this app, but the redesign made it clunky and useless. I don't use it anymore. The calendar view is gone and the map is always visible/in the background. Less available space for information, which means you need to scroll around a lot. Hard to search for specific events, the results aren't often correct. You can no longer view event discussions and the app sends you back to Facebook, which defeats the point of this app. I am just using the web event page instead now.",
      "I try to search events in my town, the app shows events in a city 500 kilometers away from me, even though there are tons of events where I am. I thought it would be more useful than Facebook's events tab which is also really really bad, but this app turned out to be the worst. Facebook is just the definition of how to be the most user unfriendly platform ever.",
      "It has a lot of bugs in it. Half the time you can't see all the information, especially if they put a link in the description. Sometimes it will lead you to the facebook website instead of interfacing inside the app. Currently it's not pulling any events. No way to sync events with your calendar either.",
      "You can see & plan your regular FB events. Perfect. That's all I want from FB, I dont really use or care about the other events in my \"Local\" area. But please rename this app.I've complained for years there's no standalone events app. I frankly dont check FB often&miss things a the time. Nothing about the name or logo indicates you can check your regular events. I assumed it was just more bloatware. I learned this WAS the events app after reading a headline when looking for a third party app."

      "Bad experience leads to a poor rating and negative comments. I purchased tickets to a off Broadway play in NY a week prior. The tickets weren't available for download 'til a before the play. With StubHub's guarantee I trusted that I would be good to and I could go ahead and plan the rest of my trip. Did I forget to mention that my wife and I flew in from TX. After a flight, checking into our hotel, and around 10 pm the day before the play, we still had no tickets. Horrible experience for sure.",
      "The app works fine, I even sold tickets that I purchased by accident to someone else through stubhub, I am not going to be buying anymore tickets though because the fees are ridiculous. I paid double because of my mistake but the fees are just not worth it... so expect the fees when purchasing tickets.... I've been using them for years but in finally fed up with paying so much...",
      "I found it difficult to find my tickets. I didn't know where to find them. Was not aware that the tickets were sent to Ticketmaster. It was very confusing..finally found them and needed the help of MSG to get them on my phone. I feel there should be better instruction when you make the purchase.",
      "Its important to make sure the email address is correct before you buy tickets, i screwed up and my tickets went to a deactivated acct.but StubHub made it right and we made it to the show...it was fantastic",
      "Great service! Tickets always delivered in time for game! Information and updates sent in timely fashion. StubHub is the best for tickets"

      "This is a good app - IF IT WORKS ON YOUR PHONE. Don't know how but it does not work on some phones that almost everything else runs on. Their alternative is to use a web site but that is cookie based instead of log in based and looses some of the major features.  Response to Socio's response: I am not running version 9.  Socio sent me a screen shot from something indicating that mine was one of Samsung's phones it would not work on.  Somehow other companies develop software that works on almost everything. The web based backup plan would have worked if they used a sign in system and if they integrated the same features in it.   It is supposed to be a 2 way communication with the event.  If you use the web version, you cannot communicate to the event at all.  This IS NOT an issue because of Android 9!  The phone I have is running an older version of Android that seems to support all software that doesn't need new specialty features.  Socio KNOWS that whatever they are using to create the software does not support some \"normal\" phones because they sent me a screen shot that listed various Samsung phone models that  could run the program and those that failed.",
      "Installed, signed up with google.  It freezes and then crashes every time I open it.  Simply awful!  Cleared cache (as suggested) and it still freezes on opening for quite a while, but seems to _eventually_ work now.  I don't know how anybody who doesn't really know their way around the phone could get it to work.  Will update the review as new issues arise"

It'll keep some here and there, but then next time I open it, or even switch between menus, suddenly My Events will be missing all but a few items! I've re-marked days worth of events 12 times now, I'll bet I'll have to do it 12 more by the time this event is over. I emailed them yesterday and got no reply. It's ruining my convention experience. :(",
      "Very useful and well organized. I have used it for one event for a couple years now. Easy to sort out what I wanted to see versus random other ones. User friendly. A few issues experienced were \"my schedule\" items being removed randomly. Also locate only did the venue on google maps not within the venue.",
      "Good app. Really organized and well thought out. Really informative. The only problem I had was the couple hours where it wouldn't show me the whole schedule for the day",
      "Would be amazing if it worked right. Have had it erase my schedule 5 times already in this last event. No reason for it. I didnt refresh or sync. It just randomly does it.",
      "Great for Ohayocon! All cons should use this. I just wish it had an optional alarm feature for event heads ups."

Anyway, it says there are no events... no events tomorrow, all week, or any other time either. It seems this app doesnt work",

Eventually i cleared cache and went back through the flow with device locations on, allowed app permissions, tried manually enter a city and use device location. Neither seemed to get my location data delivered. So just stuck there. Samsung galaxy 8 OS 8.0. Seems like a good app idea. Id try again if you guys figure out what is going wrong getting location data."

Very poor customer service.",

Then to put the Cherry on top, let me toggle between all bookmarked sessions and 1st choice sessions.",

      "Horrible! Customer service is horrendous. My first purchase of tickets: I was on the phone with their representative for the first 45 min of a concert because the virtual tickets were unable to scan. Before they finally sent me new tickets that were not corrupt. The second purchase: The date of my concert was postponed, and when I asked to exchange or refund my tickets they told me that was not possible, AND it is not possible for me to resell my tickets on their website or app.",
      "Horrible! A giant pain to access tickets. High fees. On top of that, I can't download my ticket from the app. If the app is down, I'm screwed. Just want my f###ing tickets emailed or downloaded. Too much to ask after I paid a 30% fee for the service? Aparently so. Never again.",
      "More verification steps than my bank and more sketchy-looking than a pirate NFL stream, but it's the only way I could get tickets ahead of the game. And why the hell can't I print my damn tickets? Oh yeah, cause they want to be on my phone. Uninstalling the minute I'm through the gate but they already got my data. All I can do is leave this review and go back to scalpers next time.",
      "I was looking for tickets to a concert. When I started to fill out the info for the tickets when it came to the part for payment I put in the info of credit card and right away I get a notification from my back that there were 4 charges from vivid seats and I never hit ( place order ) button. Now I'm charged for tickets I never purchased",

      "Able to get tickets last minute. Dev's have some issues to workout, however you will receive your tickets. I suggest having your tickets loaded before you get to the venue. I am a contractor for the three largest wireless carriers in the USA, towers near sporting and concert venues the day of an event are always overloaded. Do yourself a favor and load before you get to the venue, a screenshot will also work. Cheers!",
      "The experience in buying tickets is very easy but over time the fee amount above the actual ticket price has raised significantly since first coming out and they do not indicate what it is for. It'll give you a price for each individual ticket and then once selected have a total for you to buy much above the ticket price and no where does it explain what the extra money is for before you pay for them. Also for concerts, if arena name is too long it doesn't show the city it is in within the space",
      "Game time is the ticket app I use for my Orioles tickets, the prices are lower by far over every other app I've used and the interface is very attractive. The veiw of my seat is probably my favorite feature. It's very extensive so I can do all of my event searching in just one place. Thank you gametime and keep up the good work!",
      "Took a long time and several attempts trying numerous log ins to finally get into the Game time ap. Made very nervous of my recent purchase and took time away from the many other things I was to do instead of fight with this. I just hope I get my tickets and will be able to get into game??? When I can view them I think I'm going to print them out if I can just to be on the safe side. Very inconvenient.",
      "My favorite app to use for spring training games in Arizona. Fees are relatively high compared to other sites, however prices are almost always lower than StubHub, SeatGeek or others. Usually a lower all in price to purchase tickets. Selling tickets is also much easier because the app automatically sets the price to be competitive in the market. I have had very good success selling tickets. GREAT APP for last minute ticket transactions"

No reminders whatsoever on either device, even though there is an alert menu that allows you to choose when youd like to ve alerted. Ive used this app for a few years but its now time to find something new",
      "Wasted a lot of time. Phone died and all info lost. Got new phone. Spent hours inputting data and paid premium so I wouldn't lose the info again. 3 months later it won't open. Uninstall and reinstall ineffective. Waste of money. Huge waste of time.",
      "I bought this app, and discovered that many of the features don't work or are broken. For example, I entered two times that are an hour apart, but the main screen shows them being a day apart. Alarms don't work on Android. Events disappear from one of the display pages. Definitely using another app.",
      "Good app which I like to use but I paid an annual subscription to use coloured icons. Got using them once before they disappeared again. Have contacted app a few times asking why they have disappeared after I paid to use them but got no response. Poor customer service.",

Beyond that I love the duplicate info feature and hope this will help me stay organized.

      "I cannot get to read the FAQs before I get in as they're behind another login screen, when I don't have a username for this, my email doesn't work as one. I don't want to get started with my invitations to find that they will cost me an astronomical amount to send or the guests have to download the app to respond, or there are hidden costs etc. so I will have wasted my time. Open the FAQs please.",
      "Easy to navigate for the most part. Some features online from computer hard to find via app or not available in app. Also, it would be helpful if there was a way to set an RSVP end date. So, people can no longer RSVP after the date picked. After. My RSVP date if a yes person changed their RSVP to no evite allowed more RSVPs to come through. That's why only 4 stars. Other than that the experience was great. Easy to update guest list, upload photos, and send messages to my guests.",
      "Happy for years. I use evite for all of my personal and social invitations. Super simple to use and you can send invites right away. I love that you can use email or text. Also, the survey function and ability to allow guests to sign up for potluck items are bonus features.",
      "Just used evite for my son's birthday party. I was very happy with the ease of use. A few notes, some invited folks had trouble seeing the address on the invite, no way to open address quick way to open to Maps. Also, It would be nice if you didn't have to pay for another package if you ended up needing a couple more than the smallest package. I had to buy another 15 person package. You can copy and share the code, but it does not add them to your list unless they select RSVP.",
      "The app is so-so. Some aspects are great but others a big miss, like the fact that the user interface is such that I cannot see the address to the event I am RSVP-ing for or that it's impossible to find the What To Bring list for an event in the app. Fix those and it would be an incredibly useful tool."

    "description":"The new application will help you not to forget the most important events in your life calendar. You will be always aware of how much time has passed since the important date, in how many days you have to pay for the internet, when the car insurance ends, how many years have your family and friends this year, etc. The application works as a timer showing the time in different formats. I wrote this program primarily for myself for not to miss the expiry date of my bank cards, my driver's license, car insurance and all other documents that are important to me. After all, the number of documents increased year by year, and it was getting harder and harder to control the validity. This is how a need in this \"smart\" application appeared. \r\n\r\nWhen adding a new event, you can see how much time elapsed (in years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds), or how much time is left before its beginning at a timer. In addition, you can configure the repetition of the event by years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds, as well as by days of the week and months of the year. To be certain not to miss an important event there is an alert – you’ll hear an audio signal and will see the event in the pop-top menu. If necessary, you can disable the notification of the selected events.\r\n\r\nThere are also two types of widgets in the application. The first shows two closest to the coming events. The second widget can be added multiple times with different selected calendar events in it. Widgets will help you to be always aware of the time remaining to the date of the event, without going into the app. System call to the widget is made only once a minute, saving the battery of your device.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the search of the events the sorting by groups was added. You can add new groups and include your calendar events to them, such as birthdays or the validity of important documents. Also there is a quick search on the text in the names and descriptions of events. In addition, in order not to get lost in the large number of events you can change the color of their background.\r\n\r\nThe main features of the application are: \r\n•\t viewing time remaining to the event at a timer. \r\n•\t viewing the elapsed time after the date of the event (years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds).\r\n•\t sorting the events by groups (birthdays, documents, important events, etc.) \r\n•\t enabling the repetition of events by years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, as well as by the days of the week and months of the year. \r\n•\t enabling alerts when the event is coming. \r\n•\t changing the background color for each event separately. \r\n•\t adding a widget of the closest calendar events. \r\n•\t adding an unlimited number of widgets for the selected events. \r\n•\t fast text search of names and descriptions of events.\r\n•\t the function \"Active mode\" (display always on).\r\n\r\nThis version of the application is absolutely free and contains ads, but you can get rid of it by purchasing the paid version of the application. This application does not require internet connection. The app works with any screen size and changes the font size depending on the size of the screen. \r\n\r\nI would be very happy if this ‘smart’ application will help you too! Thank you!",

Some suggestions - an \"estimated cost\" versus \"actual cost\" would be really handy for future planning with budget, being able to change wallpaper/colours/background/design to suit the event style could be a cool feature because the design right now is not very \"party\", guest list should be able to count couples or families rather than having to insert every person individually to get an accurate head count, plus a notes section would be handy.",

      "Works great. Just what I needed. It is useful and can be added to the home screen. However, I'm using it in Samsung DeX. To do that I needed to combine it with Floating Apps. Floating Apps makes better, more impressive windows than Samsung DeX. It does that in tablet mode just as well. It can open all apps in a floating window and can get apps to be maximized, when DeX can't do as well. I switched to DeX because I'm using a pogo charger on my Galaxy Tab S4 tablet. Floating Apps is awesome.",

I feel like I am using a website or something instead of a native Android app since it doesn't follow any of the Material Design Principles. Also it has JavaScript errors now and then which makes it feel like the app is in a testing mode with debugging outputs.",

Normally, I would be like any other regular person who has a phone, but both my phones are acting up and have short battery life.  I can barely use the app because my main phone shuts off as soon as the app is loaded.  The other phone is just really slow and has no more memory to download.  I wish there was a web version of the app.",

    "comments":[
      "It's been a great help over at Essen, but there is some space for improvements. Namely things like searching the full list of games with designer, or theme, or mechanics. The preview of the games got stuck when I reached a game that I had previously skipped and I couldn't select skip again. Maybe I used it wrong somehow, but it became less useful for me then. The filter didn't work that wel either. Still highly recommended.",
      "This app was essential for my experience at Essen Spiel this year. I used it all the time (never used the paper version given by the event).The capacity of locating the games on the map was invaluable, and the developer was very active and nice in the BGG board. I hope this gets picked up for other events.",
      "It seems there is a bug on Android. When marking games as skipped, they get shown on the map as Must See. And when clicking on the wrong marker on the map, the app crashes.",
      "Tried this and a few others for Essen Spiel 2018 and liked this one the best. It gave me the maps I wanted and let me pick spots I wanted to visit, and it was all laid out easy to find. Looking forward to using it next year.",

      "I love it!! I think the aesthetic of the app is very cute; I love the background choices, the icon choices, the fonts, & you can decide if you want your countdown to be in days, weeks, months, or years. There are also no ad popups, which makes the app look so classy & I really appreciate that.",
      "Does exactly what it says it does. Easy interface, pleasing widgets, and plenty of options for a free app. Yes, there are occasional 5-second ads when inside the app (NOT when the widget is passively displayed), but the devs deserve to get paid. I don't find them at all disruptive or intrusive, but that's just my opinion.",
      "Wrong calculations. The app seems confused by it being leap year and the countdown is short by 1 day. Super annoyed that I've been using this and just realized it's been wrong. Also, the backgrounds and icons are limited, nothing special. Which I would be fine with if the count was accurate.",
      "Perfect to track your goals. Clean design and very affordable price if you want to go premium to unlock backups and remove ads, in one pay, without subscriptions. Thanks. :) Feedback: It would be great to have some kind of menu and (less important) search engine to improve the experience for when you have a lot of active countdowns.",
      "This application is really good. The application have some sort og widgets which are more useful than the application really is. It would be a really great app if this app would be a live wallpaper. One of the feature that could be made to make the app handy is by making the application's widget completely transparent in the screen."

      "Just bought full app so I can get full functionality. I typically have my phone in silent for what that's worth. The events are popping up along with my Google calendar event, the alarm doesn't chime unless I clock on the event. Then it counts down and Auto snoozes, and leaves a notice of a missed reminder, 15 minutes later it should fire off again but nothing. Emailed the developer but no response, hoped it'd work but no luck yet.",
      "UPDATE; Developer has been very responsive in providing suggestions to resolve issues that developed due to device update to Android 10. As of now, the initial alerts are reliable, though I still have occasional issues with snoozed alarms--perhaps due to interference with other apps. Best app I've found for its purpose.",
      "Update 24/02/20 This WAS a great App, now it doesn't work on Android Pie (9) or Android (7) Nor a friends Android 10.. I've turned off Optimisation on two phones and turned off the other calendars. Such a shame. I relied on this for everything. Having the same issues as others recently. With two alarms going off and not being able to snooze, unreliable alarms, it not popping up and over riding the screen, If I touch the screen anywhere it stops.I've spoken to Google and Samsung and they agree there must be an update needed for the app. Update 4/12/19 I've now got the paid version which is GREAT. Exactly what I need. Thank you Milan! Ocasionally when I touch the phone to snooze, it stops the alarm. I've added the app to the list that isn't energy saved. Some tones/sounds from other sources dont work with this App. The free version is in my opinion completely pointless as you can't change the alarm duration and so it's a one off sound alarm, which is the same as my phones calendar. The developer responds quickly & tries to help.",
      "Calendar event notification alarm works but follows my ring tone setting. That's, it won't vibrate nor sound off if my ringer is in silent or vibrate mode. Down side, it has only few snooze time options. It would be nice to have less than 5min and 1day snooze. I will consider the checking out the Pro version. This app is the only one that I found that works like an alarm-like notification with snooze. One other app that worked had stopped working even with the keyed version purchased. THANKS MS!"

Even when I moved to a new phone, same thing. Disappointing \"feature\" of an otherwise decent app that used to work ok but doesn't any more.",
      "I like it but theres a problem with it, why is there no option for every 3 months in duration? or even better custom make how many days weeks months or years for repeat duration setting? Maybe update the App to allow it? btw I bought your app long time ago so I'm ad free but I keep getting adverts pop up which is weird, It won't let me sync with play store so it can recognise in app purchases. Please help thanks. Will re rate 5 stars by fixing everything 😅 Edit- Hi I emailed you but no reply",
      "Get rid of the adverts! Deleted app because they want permission to use photos or I cant use the app. They say in yet another pop up they have to put adverts their to fund the app. It's literally a countdown thing! Every single theme I try pick i have to either buy it or watch the video. I'll just download one of the many hundreds of other count down aps that have less adverts and you dont have to watch a video just for a simple countdown. Dreadful app please save your time and dont bother.",

Like the fact that when you have an event for today the date change to the word today, is there a way to get \"tomorrow\" for tomorrow event/s? Thanks again for your brilliant work.",

Any chance you could add a global for picking wallpaper background for colour selection as well as the album one that exists? I'd prefer if my text matched the wallpaper colours instead of album art but that is the only minor criticism i have of an otherwise amazing bit of work",

      "Pretty bad that login works only with OAuth from FB or Google. Also, I would add an option to *not* save the credit card details. **edit after answer of the Fever Labs**: I downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star because \"Fever Labs\" provided a very lame answer to my critiques. This has nothing to do with the app itself, but gave to me the impression (probably I'm wrong, but this is just my opinion) of a team with a narrow vision for their product.",
      "Our experience was terrible, and no fault of the venue. We arrived at the location and were greeted with blank faces due to the fact that they hadn't sold any tickets so had cancelled the event. When I showed the lady my actual ticket she was shocked as they only sold tickets through their own website and another different ticketing agency and had no idea why Fever were sell tickets for them. Worst 'experience' I've ever had with such a service and am still waiting for my money back",
      "I bought tickets for an event that I mistakenly thought was in my neighborhood based on adds that were shown to me on Facebook. I'm assuming the ads were determined as relevant to me because there is a bar with the same name down the street. However the location where the event was, is over an hour away. It was an all you can drink event and there was no way I could safely attend. The refund was denied. It was $120 and there was no way to use the tickets. Bad customer service. Bad policy.",
      "This is stupid, I do not need any app to use once for a ticket, especially when there are general standards for tickets that are useable on all modern phones. A qr code pdf should be available as an alternative. I notice no mention of this nonsense is made before I have paid for ticket.",
      "Been using it for awhile now and so far so good, specially the exclusive events. The discounts are real and there's no fuss! Try it out! Get savings right from your very first purchase! :)"

      "The FORUM L.A. - WEEZER!! No one noticed the listing of them AS BEING THERE!, every day, for weeks!? Their first date when actually there, WAS in 2018, typo-ed tho as being there IN 2019, cauSES it's listing to show them as BEING there, every night! I am an UberSelect Lincoln, Uber Owner-driver, trusting frequently on Eventseeker's usual accuracy, initially chose incorrectly, on several different Uber activity planning nights, to drive, TO the Forum, thereby disappointedly missing several, actually crowded other events, at often distant, other venues. The solution might be, to hire just one person, to, every day, just simply verify and correct, any listing, which, just on FACE of it, is OBVIOUSLY not correct. Thank you guys, James.",

      "Prior to the last 2 regulation Portland Timbers matches I had issues with the Seat Geek app. On the 1st occasion, I couldn't access my tickets at all and had to get physical tickets from Customer Service. That meant I missed the 1st 20 minutes of a match. The next time I couldn't send the tickets at all when I wasn't able attend. Again, why should I have to go to customer service to get this fixed? Please fix the app.",
      "They take a service fee to provide ONE service - legit tickets. Imagine getting all excited for a show with your friends, and then getting there and being told your ticket had 'already been scanned' and you cannot enter. On top of that it's taken over a week to get a refund. DO NOT USE. --- I got my refund but +20% didn't even cover the cost of getting to the event not to mention the exteme disappointment of finding out you weren't going to get to see the show.",
      "Why do you need to send an email to verify the payout method and why is this information no where on the app or mobile site? I had to login to the full site on a computer to figure out what the issue was for selling tickets. There should be functionality in the app to upload your government ID or AT LEAST an error message with the appropriate information. You can't even view how much you spent on tickets without using the full site.",
      "Used this app to purchase tix for concerts and sporting events for about 2 years now. Hasn't crashed once, never had any issues with my purchases, very easy to use.",
      "So far it seems like a wonderful app ! And I have seen this company help many people. Not only by providing tickets, but also by being generous with money to people who need/deserve it !"
