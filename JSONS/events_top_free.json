    "comments":[
      "Everytime I check events, favorites, notifications, and account the application completely crashes. This is heavily disappointing, because if I were to attend an event and the app crashes I won't be able to go inside the venue. What would be the purpose of having the app then? The application is meant to be accessible to users (who chose to use their phone as their ticket access), but it's pointless if the ticket is inaccessible to us online through the application.",
      "The worst app ever. It logged me out and won't let me back in. I spent way to much money to not be able to see my ticket. I've had the ticket for a month and it decides to do this. Why are you not fixing it. People need their tickets that they paid you way to much money for. It's very nerve wracking not to know if the app will be working in time for my concert. Very poor customer service.",
      "Up until the last update, this app worked okay. Now this last update has caused the app to freeze and shut down every time I try to access an option on the left side bar. Email support is not available to help, rendering this app virtually useless to see the status on postponed/canceled events that I have paid for.",
      "Although I love the Ticketmaster App due to the ease of it, I am disappointed in the fact that we are not getting event updates through the app. I need to know if events are cancelled or rescheduled! I have numerous events that I have purchased tickets for months in advance and we are now coming up on those events without any notice! Your customers need to know and the app would be the best way to disseminate that information! Please add that into the app! We need to know!",
      "Just bought tickets for a concert in a month. I havent been able to log into the app for weeks! Just shows a blank white screen. There is no way I am able to view my QR codes without the app unless I get them mailed to be for an extra fee- which is NOT happening. I have already emailed the customer service and they havent gotten back to me. Please fix the login issue. Time is ticking! (will fix the 1-star review when resoved)"

It takes too long and its annoying also when the ads pop up when the actors are saying something. It's also good cause you can watch pretty much every thing .",

      "Bad experience leads to a poor rating and negative comments. I purchased tickets to a off Broadway play in NY a week prior. The tickets weren't available for download 'til a before the play. With StubHub's guarantee I trusted that I would be good to and I could go ahead and plan the rest of my trip. Did I forget to mention that my wife and I flew in from TX. After a flight, checking into our hotel, and around 10 pm the day before the play, we still had no tickets. Horrible experience for sure.",
      "The app works fine, I even sold tickets that I purchased by accident to someone else through stubhub, I am not going to be buying anymore tickets though because the fees are ridiculous. I paid double because of my mistake but the fees are just not worth it... so expect the fees when purchasing tickets.... I've been using them for years but in finally fed up with paying so much...",
      "I found it difficult to find my tickets. I didn't know where to find them. Was not aware that the tickets were sent to Ticketmaster. It was very confusing..finally found them and needed the help of MSG to get them on my phone. I feel there should be better instruction when you make the purchase.",
      "Its important to make sure the email address is correct before you buy tickets, i screwed up and my tickets went to a deactivated acct.but StubHub made it right and we made it to the show...it was fantastic",
      "Great service! Tickets always delivered in time for game! Information and updates sent in timely fashion. StubHub is the best for tickets"

And when i play the game it wants me to chose a charater. And i press the neko person. And it says Free trial. So after hours of pressing all the charaters it all says Free Trial so do we litterly have to pay 19 per week... Who ever play this has a lot of money. WHY MONEYYYYY😠😠😠😠",
      "I want to play this game but I don't have that kind of money, honestly it's not even worth it, like it looks cool but it seems that the developer just cares about money instead of making an app, like this isn't a hate speech or anything but the game could have been priced like 6 dollars a month or something affordable, I guess I'll have to find another vr app",
      "I downloaded this game to get free VRChat avatars. BUT THEY NOT FREE. YOU HAVE TO START A FREE TRIAL! I mean at least let 5 of them be free! BUT NOOO! and the free trial costs $19.99!!!!! UNACCEPTABLE! You better make some changes or I'm deleting this app!!!",

I can save my work and continue design at convenience, printing options are amazing too. Only setback is the continuous ads when moving from one stage to another. Otherwise, it's so far the best app for IV designs I've come across.",
      "Great app with lots of assets and ability to save drafts and final images. Obviously its a free app so have to put up with ads, but that's ok, keep it free I say! Editing is ok, nice font assets, but lacks ability to scale images to your own sizing. Drop shadows for fonts would be great too, for layering on images for that professional look.",
      "Just going through some designs now, but this seems like a truly great Invitation Maker App. Plenty of designs to choose from and many options for fonts, size, colours. Early days but like I said, so far it is great. Many thanks to the developers.😀 After using for several days I've concluded that if you can't find a card to suit every occasion, there's something wrong. Easy to edit, save, share, update changes. Excellent app that I highly recommend. A keeper for me!",
      "I really like this app, it has so many different layouts to choose from, you can edit it however you want, plenty of categories, it does have adds, but but not overwhemingly, i'd recommend this app to anyone wanting to create an invitation for anything.",
      "Easy navigation, heaps of templates avaipable for different event types. Editing options are easy to use. I am liking this app so far for classy and stylish wedding stationery. I will probably also use this for other invitations and card making. This is the best one I've tried yet and I've used at least a dozen."

      "Prior to the last 2 regulation Portland Timbers matches I had issues with the Seat Geek app. On the 1st occasion, I couldn't access my tickets at all and had to get physical tickets from Customer Service. That meant I missed the 1st 20 minutes of a match. The next time I couldn't send the tickets at all when I wasn't able attend. Again, why should I have to go to customer service to get this fixed? Please fix the app.",
      "They take a service fee to provide ONE service - legit tickets. Imagine getting all excited for a show with your friends, and then getting there and being told your ticket had 'already been scanned' and you cannot enter. On top of that it's taken over a week to get a refund. DO NOT USE. --- I got my refund but +20% didn't even cover the cost of getting to the event not to mention the exteme disappointment of finding out you weren't going to get to see the show.",
      "Why do you need to send an email to verify the payout method and why is this information no where on the app or mobile site? I had to login to the full site on a computer to figure out what the issue was for selling tickets. There should be functionality in the app to upload your government ID or AT LEAST an error message with the appropriate information. You can't even view how much you spent on tickets without using the full site.",
      "Used this app to purchase tix for concerts and sporting events for about 2 years now. Hasn't crashed once, never had any issues with my purchases, very easy to use.",
      "So far it seems like a wonderful app ! And I have seen this company help many people. Not only by providing tickets, but also by being generous with money to people who need/deserve it !"

This is the first time we've had an app that really works with our phone. We do have a decent phone, it's a Moto G4 Plus. Maybe the app doesn't work with older phones and older operating systems (we have a newer Android system). The camera and videocamera work pretty well, but the video stops taking video at somewhere between the 9 and 30 second mark. So we wrote to the company (Sky Rider) to see they can troubleshoot that. Anyone else have a video freeze issue?"

      "Horrible! Customer service is horrendous. My first purchase of tickets: I was on the phone with their representative for the first 45 min of a concert because the virtual tickets were unable to scan. Before they finally sent me new tickets that were not corrupt. The second purchase: The date of my concert was postponed, and when I asked to exchange or refund my tickets they told me that was not possible, AND it is not possible for me to resell my tickets on their website or app.",
      "Horrible! A giant pain to access tickets. High fees. On top of that, I can't download my ticket from the app. If the app is down, I'm screwed. Just want my f###ing tickets emailed or downloaded. Too much to ask after I paid a 30% fee for the service? Aparently so. Never again.",
      "More verification steps than my bank and more sketchy-looking than a pirate NFL stream, but it's the only way I could get tickets ahead of the game. And why the hell can't I print my damn tickets? Oh yeah, cause they want to be on my phone. Uninstalling the minute I'm through the gate but they already got my data. All I can do is leave this review and go back to scalpers next time.",
      "I was looking for tickets to a concert. When I started to fill out the info for the tickets when it came to the part for payment I put in the info of credit card and right away I get a notification from my back that there were 4 charges from vivid seats and I never hit ( place order ) button. Now I'm charged for tickets I never purchased",
      "Only use this app of you're desperate, because the service fees are f'n ridiculously high! 2 tickets cost me an extra $103.44! I then paid $24.00 for event insurance, but that is on me. The price shown should include taxes and fees. Other wise your getting blindsided with extra cost!"

      "Able to get tickets last minute. Dev's have some issues to workout, however you will receive your tickets. I suggest having your tickets loaded before you get to the venue. I am a contractor for the three largest wireless carriers in the USA, towers near sporting and concert venues the day of an event are always overloaded. Do yourself a favor and load before you get to the venue, a screenshot will also work. Cheers!",
      "The experience in buying tickets is very easy but over time the fee amount above the actual ticket price has raised significantly since first coming out and they do not indicate what it is for. It'll give you a price for each individual ticket and then once selected have a total for you to buy much above the ticket price and no where does it explain what the extra money is for before you pay for them. Also for concerts, if arena name is too long it doesn't show the city it is in within the space",
      "Game time is the ticket app I use for my Orioles tickets, the prices are lower by far over every other app I've used and the interface is very attractive. The veiw of my seat is probably my favorite feature. It's very extensive so I can do all of my event searching in just one place. Thank you gametime and keep up the good work!",
      "Took a long time and several attempts trying numerous log ins to finally get into the Game time ap. Made very nervous of my recent purchase and took time away from the many other things I was to do instead of fight with this. I just hope I get my tickets and will be able to get into game??? When I can view them I think I'm going to print them out if I can just to be on the safe side. Very inconvenient.",
      "My favorite app to use for spring training games in Arizona. Fees are relatively high compared to other sites, however prices are almost always lower than StubHub, SeatGeek or others. Usually a lower all in price to purchase tickets. Selling tickets is also much easier because the app automatically sets the price to be competitive in the market. I have had very good success selling tickets. GREAT APP for last minute ticket transactions"

      "Excellent app - very easy to set up and use. Checklist very useful - can add your own items. Good response from most Suppliers would be useful to be able to search for local Suppliers. Budgeting feature is ok-has columns for total estimate/total booked and target budget - a bit confusing in my opinion - if deposit paid/outstanding balance (+due date) were listed too this woukd make it clearer. Works well though - wish we had discovered this earlier in our planning process!",
      "Fab 😁 I love this app! It's helped with my wedding planning immensely and it's easy to use. The only slight niggle- I wish you could do a seating plan on it. You can do a guest list and if they are all day or evening though which is extremely helpful when it comes to give final numbers to the venue. I also loved the options for replies to the RSVP's and it made it so much easier to know who I needed to chase up😊",
      "I find this app absolutely amazing for wedding planning. There is a bit for guestlists, venues, a countdown to wedding day, loads of advice, and so much more. Its so easy to shortlist vendors and suppliers and send off for brochures and information for anything. This has taken so much stress off wedding planning so far and easy to have everything in one place. Highly recommend, not just for brides and grooms but for anyone involved.",
      "It's a very user-friendly app which links very well to the website. I love the budgeting tool and have found the interface very helpful. Thank you! Update 16/01/2020 This was going so well but now it glitches. When I book a supplier it attempts to update the budget used/amount booked, but it refreshed to £15808 everytime. It is now stuck on this amount no matter how many times I update the suppliers and quotes and bookings. It's no longer accurate therefore losing its usefulness.",
      "Since using this app I have not felt overwhelmed planning our wedding as without a checklist in place I'd imagine myself to be a bit of a mess ensuring I haven't missed anything. It is easy to use in term of search for venues (found our perfect venue on bridebook and is booked) YAY! I would highly advise this to my wonderful friends when they decide to get married! Love love love!!!! Xxx"

It kind of sucked because I couldn't just look at the widget and see the days left and it was so close to the end of the countdown.",

      "I'm a big fan. I'm surprised there aren't more apps like this. I'm a university student using this app to budget my time more efficiently by monitoring how much time I have left before assignment deadlines. I put my assignments in my google calendar and then sync it with hurry to get the countdown. To the developer: Can you please add an option for minute and maybe even seconds counting to the persistent notifications and to the widgets? It would make my life so much easier.",
      "I'm really enjoying this app. It's great to be able to keep track of big events coming up since my calendar is full of very mondaine tasks. The only thing I would look to see improved is the sharing option. If there is less than a day to the event I want the number of hours, minutes and seconds displayed. Not just a zero. Also, since I paid for the app please give me the option to remove the ad telling people to get Hurry on the play store.",
      "Loving this app. Have tried multiple countdown apps on the new phone and this is easily my top 2. It would have scored 5* except for one point. When countdown in its small size, it states my preferred method of counting (months) on the right hand side. When expanded it only gives me days. I would like to see the month/week/day/etc combo that most other countdown apps offer. Other then that, its perfect. 👍",
      "Best timer app ever and even better than googles calendar. Didn't have it in the first place though...you can do anything. but what I find annoying is discover and all the ones (except home) when you go back to home the nearest one to whatever day it is will go stretched (I don't know if I said it right) like If you've seen the mini game and also how many people know the mini game? (To find the mini game you just have to keep on scrolling on one of your timers until you find it) that's all I say",
      "It's a clean pretty app. It actually reminds me of an iOS app, in a good way (speaking as a recent former Apple user). The only thing I would complain about is a lack of an easy way to edit the event shown in the widget, the single event ones."

      "Very Clunky. Defeats the purpose ( for me at least ) of having a digital character sheet. I don't want to type everything in. Might as well write on paper or type up a word doc or Excel shetet. Poorly designed UI often does not fit well in screen. Skills section is hit or miss with being able to input values in their proper places. Could be a lot better with ability to import info from d20 srd, and some UI improvements.",
      "I would give it 5 stars but as a few others have also noted, we really need that \"are you sure?\" prompt with removing characters.. I just accidentally removed a character that I had been working on for months and now I'm devastated.. Maybe an undo button could suffice as well?",
      "Nice app. I would love to see an option that allows user to share their character with other users.",
      "it's ok but it would help if you could list spells, weapons and have all the skills. There are a few missing from your list, and maybe a way to add a picture of the character. Also separate slots for currency to make it easier. Also under description if you can't do the pic, an area for character description. Just a few ideas to make it easier💖. Besides that it's an okay sheet!",
      "Extremely useful for creating characters, I would give 5 stars, but that \"remove\" button needs some form of \"Are you sure\" pop up instead of just removing, because if you accidentally hit it you lose a character you may be trying to open to use, or just spent a long time working on. Other than that, easily the most useful app I have for D&D."

      "I've been searching for the card locations in the switch version, and this is is by far the most complete resource. I wish you could make separate folders for saved cards instead of lumping them together. Being able to click on a card to expand it and get a blown up picture of the card would be useful as well. Does what it needs to do, but some extra features would boost it to 5*",
      "Good works 👍 and u need to change the design and add more colours to the app, and let us create a decks.",
      "The only thing keeping this from a 5 is the fact that when you hit card search it stops the whole app to load the data for every card. I think a good change would be for it to not load card data until after you actually search for something so the app doesn't suddenly stop to load literally everything. Other than that though, works great.",
      "Useful resource for checking Card Locations using it as a companion for the Switch Release. Kinda buggy text in search bar is cutoff and scaling for Galaxy Note 9 seems off. Ads are obnoxious, paid $5 to remove ads within the app and was still getting ads sometimes this is the most annoying thing.",
      "Instantly uninstalled after getting a video ad that interrupted my first card search right after installing. Just not gonna support that type of invasive advertising. I know we all gotta make a buck, and having ads is fine,but there are better, less obnoxious ways to do it."

There should be a manual option to sign up something creepy, why you guys need our social signals to create a account in your database why not manually filling? Once provided the next prompt will be accessing of our friends list, once accessing the friends list dam you will make ads and encouraging to sign up more 😉 if I am not wrong 😊 😜",

      "Hardly worked in con center due to dead zone throughout. You scan something and have no idea if it took it. My husband's wasn't tracking his at all. It was also confusing what to scan; there were #s, barcodes w/ #s, then other #s that weren't related to the app. Some of the challenges, like interact w/ a Spartan, were confusing because it didn't say if those are real people or a cardboard cutout. The file is huge and it took forever to open, so don't ever push the back button, it exits the app.",
      "I used it for the Chicago event and by then, most major issues seemed to be fixed. The scanner that you use to find some of the hidden stuff did not work well at all and it lacks push notifications to let you know when events are getting ready to happen so you don't miss them. Other than that, I didn't have any issues that I know some people at the Chicago event had, so your mileage will vary depending on your phone. I use the Galaxy S9+.",
      "Fantastic idea.... Buuuuut. It freeezes and crashes like crazy and scanner never worked for me and that is very sad for me cause i am a very big halo fan. Missing out on scanning has you miss out on interactive things and collectibles. But if it were to be severely simplified and scanning was not needed for unlocking collectibles, as one of the attractions did by scanning your badge and it saves that info into your app without the app ever opening. So why not use the badge for every unlockable?",

      "I heard about this app because of the Friday Forty lottery to win cheap tickets to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I won that lottery after a couple months of entering and the process was so easy and smooth. I loved the seats I was given and it was a great experience. I have since found that they also sell tickets to heaps of other theatre productions and ballets that I'm interested in and they always have great rush deals which I love. Definitely recommend this app to theatre lovers!",
      "Was an easy app to use. Everything went really smoothly. Tickets were ready at the box office. Great seats and great last minute price. Highly recommend.",
      "I use TDF for the best discounts but if a show I really want to see is not on the site, TodayTix is always my back up plan and almost always comes through. Seat locations are generally good, sometimes excellent. Prices help keep theater going affordable for me. App is very easy to use and always has a wide selection of offerings. Purchase process is simple and forgiving if you need to go back and change or adjust something. The email notifications are also helpful reminders and provide all the necessary details.",
      "Really like this app. and I use it a lot. They have more shows and time choices than other sites as well as offering same day rush ticket options on some plays. Their only down side is that their prices are higher that some other websites, but they are still lower than most box offices and the big commercial ticket seller websites.",
      "I love the Today Tix app! I was able to get a pair of lottery tickets at a great price for the play What The Constitution Means to Me! I thoughly enjoyed this thought provoking interactive show! Once you sign up for the lottory, the only tricky part is making sure you keep your eye on your phone the day before the event...because if you win the lottory, you only have 30 minutes to purchase the tickets or you lose them."

      "So I proceed to download this app since I am in a town I dont know well, and I go through every option for 15 minutes and I select every single one which seems interesting, 61 topics I've selected by the way. And I am in a town of well over a million people. I eventually pick them all and it goes to a screen where it shows every event happening. The main menu, if you will. Anyway, it says there are no events... no events tomorrow, all week, or any other time either. It seems this app doesnt work",
      "I tried this app once over the summer and found a free yoga class. Now every time I try to log in, it either can't connect to the Internet or \"can't reach the Nearify servers.\" Huge disappointment, hoping it will get fixed soon.",
      "App broken. Cannot connect to servers. No notifications from the company that the app is in development or shut down. No way of contacting them. Going to presume company pulled the plug & delete.",
      "App not working. It keep saying error. A d nothing is loading. Is been like this for the past few weeks for me. Not sure exactly how long has been like that.",
      "Could not onbaord. App would not consume my location. So i was stuck on the select your location screen. Eventually i cleared cache and went back through the flow with device locations on, allowed app permissions, tried manually enter a city and use device location. Neither seemed to get my location data delivered. So just stuck there. Samsung galaxy 8 OS 8.0. Seems like a good app idea. Id try again if you guys figure out what is going wrong getting location data."

      "Really awesome. No matter I have paid for the similar app, and which doesn't work for me, and the developer doesn't reply on emails or on the store page, I have installed this free app, which works flawlessly. It's a pity that we can't send any money for this app. I would gladly pay. Thanks again 👍",
      "I can't believe this isn't a native function in Google calendar to notify you on contact birthdays. I understand I can add them manually, but why have a spot in the contact for the birthday if I just have to input it somewhere else too? This app solves that problem and lets me use my existing contact database and get notified. Amazing!",
      "Excellent app, very nice and simple UI. Still there is space for improvement to add more features. Will be useful to have Group to filter contracts inside app: friends, family and etc. Also will be nice to have zodiacs for each contact.",
      "This app works well and does what it says. The only problem though is that it doesn't have an option to export and import entries! Bummer!! That's one of the most important features, even if it means backing up to just a csv file.",
      "Good but some features don't work on Android 9: 1. Only english and russian languages work 2. Skype events skipped 3. Events with no year (google, vk, exchange) showing random birth year, typically \"1\""

      "Ride a bicycle at night in case of emergency turn this on help the other rider a lot Thank you very much for this app Best regards",
      "Love it. Works great for Halloween parties. Speed it up or slow it sown. Great for rainy day games hide and seek- only light source being the strobe. Great fun",
      "This strobe is not a strobe. A real strobe uses your led camera/flashlight light, Not your phone screen. I did find an amazing strobe app tho, and it is not this one. I mean sure, the screen strobes fast, ok, but the LED light is slow. But this other app i found, finally, strobes the LED light the way this app does on the phone screen. I can't believe i actually finally found a good strobe app, and I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS APP. THIS APP IS A JOKE!"

This app constantly uses your location services (GPS) even when you have closed the app. This equates to a constant and massive battery drain. One star solely on the fact that this app does not stop running once you have closed it. You manually have to force stop this app. This requires a lot of extra time and hassle.",

App does not actually shut down taking large amounts of batterie power as well as requires acess to your location services, so simply saying it continues to track outside of times you intend to use the app there some serious fixes that need to happen overaul. Sugestions: have the location services only be active while you are during your work hours or intented use of the app allow the app to actually close and stop running fix over all usibilty is very bogged down",

      "App takes a lot of resources and if the phone has a low battery then the app works poorly",
      "App wasn't much help. Installed so I'd always have the info I needed when I needed it even if I didn't have good cell reception... Didn't work out that way. First, not everything is even on the schedule (we missed more than one thing we wanted to see), second when my reception went down, the app wouldn't load it. Terrible design, not convenient whatsoever, and too much back-and-forth and clicking to get what info it does have. I finally gave up and just used the paper copy that was 3 pages of very small writing.... that was easier!",
      "While some aspects of the app are convenient, it's clunky to move around and doesn't default to the current time so you scroll each time you want to check the schedule - although it does default to the correct day when you open the schedule. There is a color coding system, but it's not explained until you dig into the settings and seems a bit arbitrary. A floor plan of the convention space would have been very welcome, as would some form of alert for your upcoming events.",
      "Good but could use refinement: when I click \"my events\" on the start screen, I want to actually be brought to the events I've earmarked than just the Fan Expo Canada button, of which I then need to tap, then tap schedule, then tap my events. I also found alerts didn't sound on time, often notifying me after an event was half/totally over despite being given priority. There was also no way for it to tell if I actually attend an event or not. I also want an interactive map, not just pictures.",
      "I'm updating my review of this app even though the response by the developer is completely incorrect. I was connected to wifi and using it for other things, I just could not sign up on this app while on wifi. I tried 2 different wifi networks (business and personal) and got network errors and invalid information responses on both. Once I shut my wifi off, it allowed me to sign up with no issues using my data connection. The app itself seems to work fine now that the signup issue is dealt with."

      "SCAM, COMPLETE SCAM! Please buy elsewhere. We had an emergency surgery for our 2 month old daughter (that we weren't able to schedule) which made going to our event impossible. Although we told them about this, they rudely refused any refund, or to even send us our tickets earlier than 24 hours before the event. They did this so that we couldn't resell them. We just recoup our money back. Very very disappointed, and will never use this company again.",
      "Definitely like how quick and easy the Checkout is - just don't like the paying part lol",
      "SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! Even their name is designed to fool you into thinking that your on \"Ticketmaster\". If you get the insurance you need to provide a Dr note to get your money back. The customer service sucks and they don't try to help you (or even respond to you at all. To many Hidden charges to much up sale. And the website is very glitchy.",

This would make the organization much easier. In the guest profile, there should be a switch for groom's or bride's guest and then also an option to leave it blank (which would probably mean common guests).
