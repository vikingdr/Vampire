Now, parents can grant more screen time directly from their own device.",

      "Love this app, I am managing 3 acc for my children, I can set the time limit in which they can be in their android devices. And when they are grounded I can lock it tio prevent them from using their devices. I'm having a small issue though, tried to add Dad(my husband) into the family group but we're being prompted that he isn't in the same country. I even changed it to make sure they are both set up in the same country, and still won't let me add him.",
      "This is a great resource for parents and caretakers who have children with smartphones. I am able to monitor both screentime and content from my phone. My child(ren) can ask permission to download an app from their phone. If approved I can see information about time of use and stop or limit an individual app. The only thing I had trouble with was the family location. However after disabling the wi-fi( including the phone searching for wi-fi)the location service was more consistent and accurate.",
      "Love this app.. you can lock devices and apps. Set time limits for apps. The only thing I DONT like is that you cant remove it from device you have to completely delete the Google account. You can however use the suspend feature and go right back to it.. but I would like to remove it without having to delete my kids account. So please fix that issue and I'll give you 5 stars...also wish it followed fir EVERY platform across the board.",
      "This is one of the worst apps I have ever used unfortunatly I have to give the app one star. It claims to give you control over the apps/websites,the ability to set schedule of when the devices can be used, to be able to lock devices and block apps. NONE of this is actually true. If you set a schedule for the devices to be shut down, the times will change or not lock at all. If you block an app or lock a device, it will unblock or unlock by itself in minutes. Complete waste of time.",
      "Firstly, let me say that I do like this app, it is a decent tool for helping to parent children in this digital age. The ease of navigation and control is really nice, it has some great features for controlling managed devices. I especially like the capability of locking down the devices, and the way that managed devices display real-time location in Google Maps. Also, I love that it works for both iPhone and Android (only the parent app, you cannot control Apple devices with the child app). However, there are some seriously obvious features that should be in place: 1) The option to lock-down app access on for the night should not require locking the whole device. I don't necessarily want the whole device locked. There are times I might need to be able to text my child or let them listen to music, but not want them on social media or games. Given that apps on the managed device can be manually disabled/enabled through the parent app, there should be an option to have them auto disable/enable based on time of day (whether the usage limit has met or not). 2) Usage Limits should be able to bundle apps by category. I should be able to allow a set amount of time for games, or social media, or educational games, etc., that is counted against the bundle of apps rather than specific apps. For example, my teenager right now has a 30-minute limit on 5 different social media apps, which allows for up to 2 and 1/2 hours a day on social media. I want to allow only 1 hour a day, but allow the time to be used on any of the 5 apps. Like I said, I do like the basic premise of the parental app. It just is missing some CRUCIAL features to make it a GREAT tool."

      "This game is great! But I suggest that you also allow other rooms to be remodel. Badly want to make the other room color pink so it'll suit more as little girls room (just like the other one, the blue room, i turned it as a little boys room). I'm also hoping that you'll be allowing the other appliances to be rotated (4 sides). Over all this is a great game. Good job! 😊 thank you for creating this wonderful game!",
      "After playing this for a few weeks, the game is a lot of fun! Building the lives of characters first that you chose, then they might want kids, OR not. If you have any kids, they grow up and are a lot like you raise them! And you can choose three areas of work to start with, and more different jobs later if you want! Your kids can take over the house after the parents die, or when they graduate school and need a place to live, there's a lot of options and it's a lot of fun simulation style!",
      "It's nice and enjoyable. Nice little time waster. Whish I could give them each names and do wish the pets aged too. I don't see what the carousel does. I do wish this version was available on my PC, cause I like that I can upgrade some rooms for different color scheme. Otherwise it's nice game.",
      "I like this game it's just I kind of feel like the first one is better because you don't have to build houses and rooms and stuff and it brings back so many memories playing the first one but I like this one because you can move furniture around but I hate how it's so expensive for just one room renovation but overall I really like it",
      "ive been playing this game for about 4 months now. the letters between margaret and bill is cute i enjoy that. i think you should add more house wallpaper decoration options and add other rooms to it. this is a great game and i enjoy playing it."

Help your child make healthy decisions about what they do on their Android device, with activity reports showing how much time they’re spending on their favorite apps. You can see daily, weekly, or monthly reports.<br>  • Manage their apps - Handy notifications let you approve or block apps your child wants to download from the Google Play Store. You can also manage in-app purchases, and hide specific apps on their device all remotely from your own device.<br>  • Feed their curiosity - It can be hard to figure out what apps are right for your child, so Family Link shows you teacher-recommended apps on Android that you can add directly to their device.<br><br><br>  <b>Keep an eye on screen time</b><br><br>  • Set limits - It’s up to you to decide the right amount of screen time for your child. Family Link lets you set time limits and a bedtime for their supervised devices, so you can help them find a good balance.<br>  • Lock their device - Whether it’s time to go play outside, have dinner, or just spend time together, you can remotely lock a supervised device whenever it’s time to take a break.<br><br><br>  <b>See where they are</b><br><br>  • It’s helpful to be able to find your child when they’re on the go.

See a list of compatible devices at families.google.com/familylink/setup<br>  • While Family Link helps you manage your child&#39;s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.<br>  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps.<br>  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, it must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet.<br>  • Teacher-recommended apps are only available on Android devices in the US to parents of children of certain ages.<br>  • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience, it does not make the internet safe. Rather, it is intended to give parents choices about how their kids use the internet, and encourage conversations about internet use.",

      "It's not worth the trouble. I downloaded it today, set timers and restrictions and everything was great, UNTIL I needed to change a setting on my child's device. So, I try to open the APP on MY device in order to use HIS device and I can't. The message screen reads \"Currently offline\" even though I'm not. What was the problem? I haven't got a clue. Nothing I tried did any good so I reinstalled it (its working again) and am now deleting it from both devices. I would give it 0 stars if I could!",
      "Great app, this app has very bad reveiws presumably because all the kids whose parents put this on their phones to limit their screen time dont like it. Well all that means to me is that it really does work well if the kids dont like it!😀",
      "This is like being in jail. If you REALLY can not trust your kid then I recommend this app. This will give your child very little freedom. It is also very hard to manuver this app for the child and parent. It may be fustrating. This app does not work without wifi as well.",
      "I feel violated and trapped this the terrible! When the phone locks it locks, and you cant even text or call people. Which if i were in a real emergency after screentime or \"bed time\" id be screwed. terrible app!",
      "The way it counts time spent on apps is extremely inaccurate. For example, it shows my total screen time as 1 hour and 45 minutes. However, if I look at how long I've spent on apps, it shows me as used 30 minutes each on 4 different apps. Which doesn't work. Also, it doesn't show you how long you've been on certain apps when you first open the app. And maybe let the kids look at the settings their parents put in place for them instead of a \"learn more\""

      "I have had this game for very long time and I can tell you it's probably my favourite game that I have played. I have never seen a game of this style.I have played other virtual family games and they are not as fun as this one. This is an absolutely amazing game I have played this game since I was still in my singular digits, now I am 18+ and still enjoy this. I highly recommend you download this. the only downside of this game is: it's not very \"exciting\"",
      "I loved Virtual Familes 2, but this one is just not it. Took forever to download, restarted my phone, disconneted and reconnected the wifi twice, still isn't working. It finally donwloaded, and i got into it it was all glitchy. I was hoping for something good, and the graphics are ok i guess. Im not not very happy with the results that i got.",
      "It's a really good game but for some reason it keeps on giving me a negative amount of coins whenever I open up the game which sets the amount of coins I have to zero.",
      "It's a lot of fun playing the game! Simulation of life and household work, or computer, woodworking, cooking, cleanup and a lot of fun things to do!!!",
      "I love this game, it's so fun. There's no other game like this one. At first it seemed a bit boring but then i grew extremely fond of my little family and the cute graphics. It's so great, i love it!!!"

I was still at the loading screen at the time and I thought \"Hm maybe the game wont be like this when i get past the loading screen.\". But, nope. That means I cant access the family button or any other button except for the ones at the top. This was great when I played before.",

Also, stop ignoring all the critical reviews. Its rude.",

      "I see a lot of potential for this game. I reccomend a catalog system to keep track of, or show, what resources that a plant or rock will produce. I found myself getting logs when i wanted branches. The energy economy forces me to play for about 10minutes then I have to leave, watch a couple of anime episodes, while i wait for energy. How often the restroom works is a mystery. When exiting a workshop the screen becomes very sensitive (the slightests flick of the thumb sends your view across.....",
      "The game is really challenging, entertaining and requires a lot of patience. But it's a lot of fun to play. I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5 because you require energy to complete tasks and it takes too long in my opinion to get/gather enough.this means you have to take long breaks inbetween playing and I dont like that",
      "Do the developers listen to those who've downloaded the app? The energy requirements to break rocks (200, 250+) is ridiculous. Yes, I could save up my energy for days on end but THAT IS BORING. It makes the game have no playability factor. There's no seashells anywhere. Not only do I need them for main island upgrades, a totem I need to complete an island challenge needs 15 clay jars, that's 30 seashells. I get one a day, maybe 2 if I'm lucky. So that's 30-60 days to make jars. FIX THIS!!!!!!!!",
      "I would rate this game higher if you could really play this game without spending a ton of money. I'll get a reply telling me of all the wonderful ways one can find energy without spending money, which is true, but you won't find enough to keep you playing for more than 10 minutes. I will eventually delete this game so I don't spend any more money. I downloaded this game a month ago and I've spent over $100 but have nothing in game to show for it. Fun game for the 10 minutes you get to play.",
      "Love the cute graphic and gameplay. Dislike the energy recharge rate of 120 second per unit. Should reduce it to 60s, better still 30s per unit recharge rate. Im at lvl 8 and it seems it takes forever to recharge energy and many task requires gathering of resource, which deplete energy. Suggest to developer to allow view of advertisement to recharge energy. So when player want energy, they just need to view ads. Starfish and sea shell are too scares, make the refresh rate faster."

Periodic Lee I have to physically open the app in order to reset it, it would be nice if it notified me when it needed to be reset or if it just didn't need to be reset. I will periodical I get a text from my wife telling me that my family locator is offline again. All I have to do to fix this is open it and close it and then it stay is good for quite some time.",
      "Was acceptable for £9.99 annually even though it was flaky at times. Just re-subscribed for another year automatically took my £9.99 only to find that it does not give me full version anymore as it's gone up to £54.99 every 3 months???? Nice of them to let me know!!!! So £9.99 out of pocket. £219.96 Annually it's a joke. Have unsubscribed and deleted!!!!! Use Google share location it's free & more reliable.",

    "recentChanges":"Introducing automated crash detection, for free!<br>Crash detection, one of our most loved features is now available for free to all of our users. Here&#39;s how it works: if you are involved in a car crash (either as a driver or a passenger), Life360 will notify your entire Circle and your emergency contacts so you can get help faster. You can also upgrade to Driver Protect to get emergency dispatchers sent to your location. And it covers your entire Circle, so more safety for the entire family!",

      "App was working great for a couple of months and then it stopped working. It keeps saying location permissions are off but when I go into settings it says on. Tried everything; deleted circle, created new, uninstalled/reinstalled, checked app settings and permissions. Super annoying. Stop paying for premium and uninstalled.",
      "I have been using this app for a while and love it! Since the recent update I have been having lots of problems, like it not showing correct leave times, how long it takes to travel and arrival time. It's showing it takes 20+mins for a 7min drive or 2.5hrs for a 1hr drive. It's kind of frustrating as my husband and I use this for the safety of each other; he works out of town & is a volunteer firefighter, I care for our 4 children some of who see out of state doctors. We also travel alot.",
      "Worked perfectly at first, now it glitches ALL THE TIME! It used to keep accurate location, trips, and trip speed. Now it's all over the place, the trip speed rarely works, and location is highly inaccurate. I've checked for updates, checked settings to be sure all permissions were allowed and it still doesn't work right for any of our circle members. I suspect because I have the free version and they want me to spend $7.99 a month for it to work the way it should.",
      "It used to work good, but the last week or so its been crashing and freezing and also refusing to alert me when people leave their locations. Presently its showing me inaccurate locations for people. Shows people several feet away from where they are actually located moving, when they are not actually moving. I have even seen my own icon moving around when I know for a fact I'm sitting in my home in one spot with my phone in my hand. I've checked all settings for my phone and their phones, I've done steps listed in the FAQ's. Of course some robotic response will respond to this and tell me its on my end (always blame the user) but I believe this is an app glitch.",
      "It's very good at telling me my movements but doesn't work very well with my son's older iphone. Has so far only correctly shown me where he is twice. I have to rely on old school text messaging. Found the problem under FAQs. Life360 needs to use mobile data, which my son barely has any of, rendering this app pointless. Uninstalling."

      "So far, so good. I just started playing this game and its been fun & relaxing. Sometimes these match tiles games get frustrating when you cant pass a level and so you just end up deleting the game after you've decorated only maybe half of it. So, we'll see if this game becomes too difficult to get anywhere with it. So far I have been enjoying it.",
      "I love the story and designing the hotel, but it is too hard to proceed because most of the obstacles like stars and boxes are at the bottom part and are compressed, and you need to hit them multiple times to clear them, but the number of moves is not enough, and power ups are not so powerful if it takes multiple hit to clear an obstacle",
      "The game was fun until the higher levels, it takes at least 10-20 tries before I get to pass the levels, and the decorations or I should say the story, take at least 3 stars to complete. It's also extremely hard to get money or power ups. Which just makes people frustrated. It's obvious that this is a pay to win game.",
      "Great game! The Disappearing walls are a little awkward and glitchy sometimes but overall that's probably the only problem I saw with graphics. The actual story line is really good and gets a little slow sometimes you can't make tap forward in the conversation you either have to skip it all or sit through the whole thing. Please don't do it so many other games have done and just fled their game with ads every time you turn around. Maybe steal it back a little even make the ads optional for bonus",
      "At first its a great game with a fun storyline. I didnt really mind the fact that it was a copy of Homescapes. But by the time you get to level 37, its impossible to play without spending hundreds of pounds on coins and powerups. Im sick of it. Im just gonna uninstall and get Homescapes instead. And YES I HAD USED UP ALL THE FREE BONUSES"

      "I never even try this game but I bet it's going to be greatevery other game I try to play that's his virtual mother you can pick your own clothes you get a move by yourself you don't need help I don't tell you how to play it I want aim like Sims 4 but where it's not it's virtualweather like to make love you get at have kids you get a raise them yourself not with them okay 😉😉😁 that's how it all works it doesn't it doesn't work in like I'mma tell you what to do if you better listen. Game oh yea",
      "I honestly enjoyed the game however, the levels method is rather tedious. It would be better if there would just be a list of to do lists and a clock to remind what task to do. That way, the player could actually have the time to roam around the beautifully made rooms and city and interact with other items. It went smoothly for me, so thank you for that experience. Too bad, I couldnt roam around and look around the map.",
      "Way too many ads. Only played 1 level and seriously had to watch 5 ads. I'm uninstalling, not worth it.",
      "Tried to play, 2 advertisements before I could even load the first level. Then 1 more after the first, very short level. Forced 30 second ads. Already uninstalled the game. I want to play a game, not watch ads.",
      "Well, what can I say? This has got to be one of the most frustrating games ever! I lost count how many adverts there were before I actually got to do anything, that was seriously annoying. I know it is done so that you will pay to stop the adverts, but it would be good to let the game get to the starting point before it bombards you with them all. Then there are the controls to move the Mum around. Well, after she had bumped into the wall a few times I gave up. I shall uninstall now!!"

      "Great game but it finishes with no task left to do, no place left to Reno! Somewhat unrealistic as well! Huge mansion but only 2 bedrooms with a huge number of people! Bedrooms band nursery 4 levels apart! In what world is that realistic!",
      "First i loved this game thougnt its different from other games, but when i started to level up i cant figure the puzzle out and running out of moves however i tried so i stuck at level 118!!!!! So i i figured out, this game is not different to others, just try a little bit more if doesnt work just like other game i will delete this",
      "Not what I thought it would be finished the decoration, and now you play the game to collect all the characters and then what do you do ????? Thinking of deleting it",
      "Very cute and nice game what could have been cool more of different colors for things, will there be more rooms and maybe outside design in the game to?please if you add more rooms or outside design please do not add haunted rooms or please no magic wands or no witches no ghosts no zombies, this is a very very Beautiful Cute game PLEASE NO SCARY STUFF. THANK YOU,",
      "It is a really cute game! It does take a little bit longer to load then expected, but other than that I really like it. It has a cool storyline as well. The levels are just the right amount of challenging and doable. Would recommend."

      "App has many major issues. If a child is on a FaceTime or other means of communication and the time passes for the lock, it won't lock it. I have a child who was on an hour after the lock because they figured out that bug. Too easy for them to delete the companion app. It should require a pin or method to lock it down. Apparently other vpns also will let you bypass the lock. This app only works for kids that aren't real tech \"smart\". You should expect kids will try to disable it. Please explain",
      "Does not work as advertised. Overcomplicated install and registration for my teen kids and gave them access to billing. There are free apps that are better. I was using the premium option. Update, I gave it an honest try a year later and still a huge disappointment. Esp when I paid for the top level monthly service.",
      "(Update: Verizon still has not fixed it after months of talking to them.)This app will not hold on to any time restrictions or blocks. It resets all of my time restrictions to 1:00 am just about every time, or deletes some of them. It unblocks blocked sites. Calling Verizon tech coaches didn't help -- they said it was working fine. This app also turns the child's internet back on when I have turned it off. They tried to blame the child, but this happened even when his phone was in my possession.",
      "It works lol. Only problem is, you cannot control or track your kids unless, they download the app, then make an account, & then turn on the necessary permissions. As a IT professional, i know Verizon tracks EVERYONE'S phone and, if we pay for the service(a lot might i add), why download all these apps? I can view call logs and messages sent from 'My Verizon' app, along with everything else the app does? Lol.",
      "This app NEVER works properly.. Location is highly inaccurate when it wants to update and the \"Limits\" don't work. Kids are still able to access everything. The ONLY feature that works is being able to block texting FROM EVERYONE.. even authorized recipients!! My kids can't text me because I don't have the same kind of phone as them apple vs. Android! Not recommended!!"

      "Great app and love the idea. But honestly who would pay $67 a year for the premium version?! I would consider going premium and rate more stars if the price was more affordable per year! I mean a calendar is $5 for the year :S I get that it has more than a calendar. Facebook is free. Recipes on google are free. To do lists and grocery lists on the app store are free... :S",
      "We have a very extended family that relies heavily on knowing when things are happening. This is the best app that I have used in order to get everyone on the same page. My family ages from 17 to 65 and the app is great for everyone. Easy to use for older adults...and those less tech savy; and teenage friendly...can post pics and selfies.",
      "I'm currently in my free month, but I'm considering paying for premium. I am concerned about the payment system, though. The app advertises it costs $45 per year. But when you join premium, the only payment option is $5 per month. Hmm.",
      "Great app! New to it, but so far it Keeps us organized and in sync with our \"To do\" list and everyone being able to add groceries or things we notice we need around the house. Lightens this momma's load a little!",
      "Great app! My teens both have it on their phones to keep a track of whats going on. Suggestion would be when imputing ingredients in the recipes or items in the shopping list, categories would be good. Eg: meat, veg, frozen, etc... I shop in sections so if the generated grocery list came out grouped in categories it would be much easier. A budget tool in the app would be great too. I would love to be able to set out my budget in the app to help us all stay on track."

      "I laughed so hard about some of the glitches light here are some of the glitches some of the animals like froze and stop moving some of your Cubs or even your mate starts flying away from you it's gone plus I like that you can add expansions to your game and there's also as many quests you want to do also if there were like at 10 star rating I would put more than that I would put more than five stars I would do more than 50 stars I love this game thank you for whoever made this game thank you !!",
      "Absolutely terrible game it is so repetitive and gets boring after about 2mins. Will get a 3 star if a new animal is added to each map and the game could do with a few bosses",
      "Till now I was playing in the island and it went smoothly. But now when I try to download desert area I can't download because it always shows 'Can't downloaded the location. Check the internet connection and free space'. Even though my internet connection is stable and there is enough free space. I tried a lot but could not download the location. Please fix this.",
      "Honestly, this needs improvement. The grafics aren't even that good and the controls are horrible! The panther runs around as if he got hurt and could never walk again! The cubs and mate can run in water while the main character you're playing as has to swim slowly! Most of the time when I I tryed to hit a target it wouldn't even take any damage! Everything is expensive! This game sucks! Don't waste your time playing this!",
      "This is good but the bad thing is that it,s kinda glitchy but it allso makes the gorrila two shotte you witch is something you should avoid happening"

      "You know what would be great? If the app stopped logging me out every 3 days. You know what else would be fantastic? If I could get rid of coupons that I KNOW FOR A FACT that I don't need. You make it easy to clip stuff that I don't even want. Now make it easy to delete it. And why does this app even NEED a password??? Because someone may steal my coupons??? Oh nooooo. Now you're just acting like over glorified CVS or Rite Aid or somewhere that actually has full shelves.",
      "App worked great until my phone broke.. I had to reinstall on another phone.. Don't EVER forget your password. It's impossible to do a password reset I have a bunch of saved coupons and spins.. Family Dollar won't let me reset my password. The link in the password reset email just goes to the main page. The \"contact us\" link on the password reset email is a broken link as well. I tried calling the 800 number but apparently the line is only open \"bankers hours\". Closed before I leave for work . Already closed when I come home from work. Not open on weekends either. When I do take time off to call, I can't get a hold of a real person.. Just a voicemail system with a mountain of options, but no option of \"app help\". I left messages but no response. I spend a lot of money at Family Dollar since they are the only store within 15 miles from me. If I can't get coupons, I'll just buy my stuff from Amazon..",
      "What a POS. I just tried to sign up and it has so many bugs just trying to key in a password that I'm am deleting it already. No sooner did I try to log in, it told me to change my password. When I sent for the code, it auto filled the code then sent me to the page to key in the new password....only there was no space to create one. I tried 3 times and it just sits there waiting for me to key something in with no space to do so. I'm beyond frustrated.",
      "The app is horrible and almost as crappy as the products they carry. Don't bother downloading this app. Nobody at the stores know anything about it or why it doesn't work. You will spend your time clipping coupons only to find out at the cash register that you didn't fulfill the requirements that were buried 3 screens deep when you clipped it. A HUGE WASTE OF TIME.",
      "Its ok, but only if ur looking for specific items. Wouldnt let me use the 'list' function on the app, the scanner wasnt that great either!"

      "l like the match 3 partof the game but 90% of the time she is just planting flowers or bushes and that is boring. Have her actually do something and I would play the game. Until it is changed it will stay uninstalled. Now I get to over 200 level and it started me back at level 1. I just installed it. I'm not playing all those levels again.",
      "Well i enjoy the game honestly but nobody responds to emails to help me with questions so that is confusing. Also saying that the app is not set up for signing into Facebook and yet the popup comes up over and over to get 900 coins to do so? So again confused. I was on the fanpage its not recent so itcant be a new game like it says or perhaps I'm just way wrong lol anyway it's a cute game if you want to pass the time.",
      "Game is great and love it. But after I got to level 223 it now freezes up after fail the level. I have to back out of game and start over at level 223. Frustrated enough to delete the game. Lots of other games to play.",
      "I would have once given this game 5 Stars because I love this game but I'm very disappointed and now on the fence. The amount of coins given for the difficulty levels is way low and I keep getting a message saying I need permission to ask friends for lives or share a level on Facebook.",
      "10 months and still no new levels . What's going on. I really enjoyed the game. I have to start from level 1 because i cant log into facebook. Keeps saying i have to ask for permission. WHY?! 100% disappointed with this app. Should be zero stars!"

      "Needs improvements... The anolog stick is so small it is like it was made for a 5 year old's finger. The map is always blocked by your thumb because of how close it is to the anolog stick. Way too many ads that pop up at the wrong time every time. Movement is slippery and not in sync with how you are moving the anolog stick. GUI is kind of messy and squished together. This could be a cool game, but it needs so many fixes to make it more user friendly before it can be a cool game... Good luck.",
      "I love it!!! It was perfect! When i deleted this game my brain was saying \"NOOOOO! My love!\" so i had to download it again and i love it too! And update the game so your Snowy Cheetha Simulator AND Lion Family Simulator is REALLY AWESOME! So yeah and PLEASE DON'T LET THE OTHER GAMES WIN!!! DON'T FORGET THE OTHER GAMES!!! 😲",
      "I love this game it is cool the best part is that It will let you spin a wheel and gives you coins and you get to breed cubs and play with other people around the world It is amazing! AND BLAZING!!!",
      "The game is a wonderful time killer despite the glitches it is fun and I like being online knowing I'm not alone and I love my cub Simba he's fun to interact with and this game gets a five star from me.",
      "This game is great,but can you please add this: When the cubs grow up,instead of leaving they should stay and breed whith the other to make the pride stronger. When they swim they should be able to go under water and catch their pray. And the other animals that are in herds in real life should be in herds in the games. Thank you for reading Hope you do this and if you do please tell me. Please do it as soon as posible!"

      "Good, but I gave it a four because.... well, two reasons the turning is a little bit too long to turn and when your about to die and your enemies, are chasing you and trying to kill you well, that parts fine but... when your health is like 16 or 17 present, in the corners, black blood is in the corners literly BLACK BLOOD like really were kids, ilastaters! Well try and have fun but since I was grosed out by the *caughs* BLACK BLOOD thingy you will and it's on cheetah Sim but I like wildcraft Sim",
      "Ive had this game for almost 2 years now. I had it on my iphone first, then when i switched to an android. One thing i noticed is that there are 2 different app versions for ios and android which means that iphone and android users cannot play together. That was a big downer for me because i didnt know anyone on the android version. Please make this game a cross platform one so people from all different devices can play together and ill make this 5 stars. Thanks",
      "It's really fun in love it. But there's 2 things that need to change 1.should get refunds and be able to sell skins 2. You should be able to play with your friends offline! But I bought the normal forest I'm after deleting 2 apps and I have full Internet and it still won't let me get it!",
      "This game was awsome then when I deleted it then down loaded it again it was bad. Sometimes there's no map. Sometimes it won't let me feed my animal (even I know how) and it's so hard to control the tiger it always is hard. I maybe would like it better if it was more better upgraded.",
      "This game is awesome and it's my fav game there's one small glitch though I LOVE this game SO much . When I found it I was just looking for a new game and I saw this and I got it but I never thought that it would be a game that I would play every day . So awesome job area 730 👍♥️♥♥♥♥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"

      "Second rating. It is a great App. What is missing is the ability to tick off the items on the to do list and schedule the to do items on certain days. I think it is quite an important feature in our busy world. At the moment you can make To Do lists (even shared ones which is fantastic), but have no tracking ability on what has been done. Might have to re think whether I am buying a full subscription next year again.",
      "This app has been a tremendous help with both by wife and my communication. She has an iPhone and I have an Android and it still works great. I'm very frugal, but I did pay the $30 annual upgrade and it is worth it. The App is simple to use, straightforward, and reliable. This app has legitimately solved a long time problem that my wife and I have been trying to figure out with our scheduling.",
      "Generally, the ability to keep everyone on the same page has been nice, but as other people have stated, the interface is quite dated. I've also had multiple issues with getting my whole family logged in. The lack of access to a direct customer support center is also very frustrating. Overall, it does what I need it to do as a widget by showing me what is happening that day and the next. Honestly, I won't renew my subscription. I'd rather teach my kids and husband a new app that's less $.",
      "Love the app, its great that my husband can see what i see on the shopping list however make sure you both add things to the correct grocery list. I would give this 5 stars if this app offered a month view widget like my google calendar. I use my google calendar and have so much trouble syncing my google calendar with cozi as the google calendar events are not editable through cozi but cozi doesnt have the month view widget i :( Ive had the paid version for over a year.",
      "I really wanted to like this since it looks cute and streamlined, but it is a bit redundant when integrating with Google calendar. I have my Google calendar color coded by family member/bills/urgent/etc and then Cozi has a color scheme for family members, but you lose the coding when you integrate the two. So you end up with a color coded cozi entry, and all entries from Google in a single color. So I have to redo all my Google onto cozi by hand, or just delete Cozi. Guess which one I pick..."

Secondly, when it was loading the bar was full in red (that meant it was done) andit still says 'loading'. Thirdly, when i pessed play, it wouldnt play!!! I pressed it multiple times and it STILL DID NOT PLAY!!!!!! AND FINALY, i pressed the red arrow on the right side of the screen and a fuew scrolles in.GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?!?!.IT TURNED BLACK AND WHENT BACK TO MY HOME SCREEN. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!",
      "This game was great. This game was great because I got to play 30 levels and I get to play level 31 coming soon.",
      "Honestly I think this game is ok it's realistic I barely get that in games! A bad thing about it is the characters there eyes look like they rolled in the back of there head and they sit hunchback the toddler crawls weird too. I would recommend this game if you don't mind creepy characters that's probably like the only issue except hunchback and creepy crawling toddlers! Try out the game you might like it!",
      "Hii, this game is very good and it is perfect for children. Thank you.👍👍😀",
      "I do not like it because the baby crawls weird and the eyes of the characters look like rolled into their heads. Also the characters walk and move really slow. Another thing is when they move their backs are like hunched and its creepy. And it instructs u every thing it has like these circles u have to go to and even if u try to go to the door next to it it wont let u go it makes u go to where the circle is. Also there is a boost button to make the avatar go faster but it still goes really slow."

      "This game is very entertaining and very addictive! I played it years ago and I was a bit too young for all the violence, so I'm glad it says E 10+ now 🙂. Sadly there is a few problems I remember... like slow loading, so I couldn't give it all stars. One thing that kinda worries me is that even though it says Everyone 10 and up, it still says family friendly. Anyways overall Cheetah Family Sim is a good game.",
      "It's fun, intresting and realistic (even if it is animated). WIth great graphics and userfriendly controls, it is easy to navigate and understand. It is a great game. Many other animal life simulation games are very boring, but this game is different. With challenges and a fun setup, this game is entertaining to the max.",
      "This game is so fun! I don't understand if you are the mom cheetah or the dad cheetah though. I like that when I kill the cayote my mate comes and helps me if I come with my family, but it would be better if you could also see your cub. This game needs updating but it is also VERY fun.",
      "I haven't had it that long but I like it a lot the only thing you could improve on is you have to wait until a level until you breed other than that good so far I am sorry it is short but I haven't had the game that long that is also because of the low rating 👍",
      "This is a game where you can play as a cheetah. You can have a family, customize you and your family, hunt, upgrade your home, complete quests, and explore new places. But nothing is perfect. Other animals can hit you while your a good distance from them and they fly into the air, running backwards, trying to hit you. They even stay airborne for a couple seconds, after they stop running backwards to kill you. Game is a bit glitchy, but witch game isn't? Anywho, this is a game game."

      "This is sooooooooo baddddd when i started playing well i couldent play. I couldent run or do anything this is such a horrible game i do not recomend any one to get this game and to much ads stupid game i could do better making my oun game in fact i will some day do not donloud. Im telling you you will hate it. Not trying to be rude sorry.",
      "This has many flaws. First, too many ads, I mean I know you gotta make money off this game but a good suggestion is to make money off purchases. And yes, I saw, you purchase something, the ads are gone. Im no game creator but you should at least pop up less ads. Second, quality, textures, pictures, transitions are just plain trash. I mean you could do better. Its like playing one of those GTA San Andreas game, but that game has a more retro old type feel. Hopefully you fix other flaws aswell!",
      "I choose a 1 because its a horrible game when the first time it says drop your daughter off at school and i fail i press restart and once it respawns me it automatically says you failed so i suggest that everyone that sees this comment goes and finds a different fun game because this game is a rip off game and it doesn't let us play the game and whoever made this game is unfair so I suggest you fix your game or if you don't you're going to get no people to play your game and you're going to beg",
      "It is so rubbish and it sucks I would recommend a fun and more interesting game not like this this is why I gave it 1 star 🤬🤬🤬 I would not recommend this.",
      "Horrible. Every, and I mean every, action results in an advertisement. I might have actually paid to remove the advertisements, if I could have tried it out without the nuisance of the excessive advertising. Maybe switch to playing an advertisement every 5 or so minutes, not after every action."

      "This game needs to let you confirm if you want to spend your rubies, three times now, I lost them by strolling on my phone and hitting it. I did twice by speeding up things needing to be made for the new challenge of St. Patrick's day items. This is now ridiculous. I'm not going to waste any more money on this stupid game losing my rubies. Any other game has a pop up window asking if you are sure if you want to spend your rubies but this game. I read other people having this same issue!",
      "Horrendous way to ruin a classic franchise. It's hard to get to even lv. 4, quests for exp are limited to only 1 or 2 characters at a time. And it was already hard to get coins normally, then the current St Patrick's Day event replaced ALL the regular desires with stupid SPD items that take forever to craft because you need CLOVERS, which you only get 1 or 2 (max) of every 3 friggin hours. And it runs for 9 DAYS!! In short, don't bother: This type of a**holery can only get worse from here.",
      "I keep updating my comments to see the progress of the game. The gameplay has improved by much and I appreciate the efforts. However, the St. Patrick's day event is set way harder than the previous ones. We only get 2 clover plants and the items need a LOT of clovers to craft. The only way to get more is to spend rubies on plants. The pay to win aspect of this game is getting more apparent which is a letdown for non-paying users like me.",
      "Game was good at first. Then it turned into a cash grab. I dont mind paying to play but it gets a bit much. Cant ask for more than triple a games without providing a finished product. Locked areas that cost 20 or more dollars each. No thanks. Will be deleting the game soon. Shame I spent about 50 bucks so far on it too.",
      "I like the game but I find it far too difficult to get the bits you need for events and to complete the desires without spending a fortune on in app purchases. i think it should be made a bit easier to get the things you need to make the game fair for the people who can't spend a fortune on the game. i rate the game 1 star until this is sorted out"

The app would be better if it included 2 more abilities. One, look up and save recipes and two, if it could automatically show up on my phone as my default calendar instead of Google calendar. The second it may do this already and I have not figured it out yet. If these things were to happen, if up my rating to 5 stars.",
      "I tried looking for another organizer app to replace this 1 but there isn't any as beautiful! but would be nice iF today's date was on the home screen! maybe over the highlighted day of the week, oR under the word TODAY! & would also like to be able to swipe the completed tasks away & also swipe them into any order! besides those little things.. I Love iT!",
      "I love that you can assign items by one, multiple, or all members of the family. It's even better that you can also filter by family member. Both the calendar and to-do features work well and are very user friendly. All of my current appointments within my other calendars auto populate in this app. Overall, I'm loving it. I gave it 4 stars, because I would like to see an option for multiple reminders on a single event. Developer said they would look into incorporating that in future updates.",
      "I love this app. I can add calendar events for each member of my family. It can sync to another user's phone so you see the same calendar info and grocery lists. However, the sync function has not been updating on my husband's device. Hope this can be fixed or else we may need to find another app and I have really loved this one!",

If they exceed the speed limit, you’ll know, and you can take steps to ensure they are aware of the dangers.<br>It’s an ideal solution to keep them safe both at home and when they are out.",

      "I'm updating my review... Now that my issues with the app are fixed I'd like to say that this app is very accurate, down to a few feet it seems. Three only issue I have with the app now is I can't add a place by typing an address into the place alerts, it always says error. It does however let you do a pinpoint on the map so it's ok, I do hope it gets fixed soon though... The premium is definitely worth it! 😊",
      "I'm sad to report that this app is near useless. It has some very cool features but, when all is said and done, it rarely reports anywhere near accurate with regard to location of my family members. Will watch for updates. But ending my subscription.",
      "Downloaded app. Set it up w/android phones. Then sent invite to iPhone. Entered invite code, followed prompts, and lo and behold the app showed we were at Starbucks which was correct. HOWEVER, it still shows, and continues to show the phone at Starbucks. Hasn't moved, even though my daughter has been all over the area.",
      "I have had this app all of 30 min and I am ready to throw my phone out the window. I signed up for premium but it will not give it to me and keeps asking me to get it. It shows three dots all of them are my wife. But for some reason all the address and battery life are different. Just from what I see this app is useless. Going to cancel and delete now",
      "Don't know how to refresh it for real time. But absolutely brilliant. Helpful when I was helping my wife direct around the floods we had. Would be 5 stars if it had a refresh or real time movements. Still lagging when trying to update"

      "Really great game! I remember the first time I played this there was a really bad glitch and all the babys were boys no girls at first I was ok with it but it got a little annoying. But now I dont have that glitch. But still a great game. And please PLEASE call the babys hatchlings please they are not cubs.",
      "I would say that now, it's not really a great game...probably a while back it would be good. But if anyone animal lover is reading this, I would say that you should try Wildcraft, mystery skins to get, multiple animals to buy or get in chests, lots of worlds with many different bosses, multiplayer too, friends to play with, even some cool glitches to get mystery skins. I would say it's a really fun game, and not only is there multiple animals, there's crocodiles too!!",
      "Yeah, I like this game. A few glitches that should probably be fixed ASAP. Eg, some times you spend coins, but you don't get what you paid for, and it still takes your money!! Come on guys! Also, it's terribly clear that this simulator is just Lion Simulator, but they just swapped an Croc in for the lion! It always says \"Don't your cubs look like cute little kitties?\". Dude. Last time I checked, Crocs were reptiles, not felines!! Sloppy and lazy guys. Sloppy and lazy! Jesus, get it together!!",
      "I think it is a good game but the only problem is why do we have to bye the baby make it off the level because the people that r rich can brag and I think it is not fair but at least if they have that many baby's it's because they earned it. And also plz stop calling the Crocs babies Cubs that's just the lion and the puma and cheetah Sim at least say the name for baby Crocs right and if u don't know what they r called they r called hatchlings!!!! Ok not f**king Cubs and fix the glitches plz",
      "Warning this game has a vires because I fell through the ground and was stuck no one could see me I told all of the players and they didn't believe me apart from one person which isn't good I uninstalled it straight away if you're reading this take my advice before things go wrong but on the bright side I was enjoying it at first so one star so won't be playing anymore of your games sorry (wasn't a fan any way)"

      "I do really like this app. I have the basic version which me and my partner share but since the last update, as someone else mentioned the location of an event isn't found! Bit annoying. Whole permission seems to have been lost. Overall a good shared calendar with colour coding and have used the shopping list and memo's too to share info.",
      "My reason for 3 star.. when this calendar minimizes it's hard to open it up at times. And it doesn't populate or update deleted or updated events as soon as possible - there is a lag. Like I said I would have given this a 5 if there was Corrections are made but I do like this app just need to touch up",
      "The widget for my bike screen never works. It always disappears. And I have calanders imported to my families shared calendar, and I thought with it being a SHARED calendar others who share my calendar would see the events. Turns out that's not correct! I have to go in and edit each imported event for everyone to see it. Just an extra step and very time consuming and annoying.",
      "Been using this app for about 2 years now and its the only calendar app i use. I love how everything i need is in one place.. My schedule, shopping list, to do list, and all my memos are easy to access without searching my phone for multiple apps. I really love how i can share my schedule with my SO and kids so everyone is in the loop. I definitely recommend this app to families or single parents with kids or really just anyone.",
      "App used to be a lot better. When adding location of events, it will not find addresses at it did before. Looking for one that will allow places and addresses as it is easier for others to see."

It's a total invasion of privacy because its constantly tracking your location and phone activity for literally anything 4. You cant even deactivate it without a parent 5. It enforces helicopter parenting and makes children feel as if their parents dont trust them at all which isnt a good method of parenting Overall, if you're a parent reading this, dont use this app.",
      "I would not recommend. It works fine, but its the things it keeps you from. It limits how much I can text people, it won't let you text or call someone who your mom/whoever's is in charge of your uses doesnt add to your contacts. (you can't make any new contacts, just who's in charge can add them) They limit apps, keeping me from socializing, etc. etc. etc. Do not download. How to get rid of it: Restart phone and as soon as it loads delete",
      "I am writing this to warn others about this. For starters I will say the app does indeed work as intended. It's fine. What's wrong is why it works. It's soul duty in life is to give parents control over your phone's data and usage I think. That's all my mom uses it for anyway. I hate it. The worst part of this is it adds a data cap that is different freon the data cap your phone plan might have. I have infinite data but because of this app i now have a data cap. Don't get this app and help me.",
      "There's a way to uninstall, but it'll reset your whole phone, so back up anything you can. Reboot your phone into recovery mode, and get to where you can clear data (otherwise, reset) from your phone. It'll uninstall this in the reset. -Hope this helps, Mozza",
      "I'm a kid and am using the app at this moment but the only thing is that my parents block playstore. You be asking \"how are you on playstore then?\" Well in 3-4 easy steps you can access everything on the internet along with all the apps on you phone that have been block by this app. I do t think I'm allowed to say what the steps are but they work for me. I play games during school and also use snapchat. The only thing that doesn't and is still blocked is you cant send messages. Gud job Verizon"

      "It does not always keep up to date but my main criticism is that you can't remove anyone unless you are using the phone that you started with which is impossible if the phone was lost for example. Currently I have three of the same person on my family",
      "Sometimes slow in locating.",
      "The app works ok but I have not been able to add my email address and despite setting all optimisations it still says I need to set vendor specific battery optimisations. The contact page on the web site is 404 and there is no means to contact the developers other than that, it seems. (I note how ever there is an email address here) Not very satisfactory.",
      "The only thing I would add to this is like a GPS system so that way it can direct you directly to the people you are looking at just incase they don't know exactly where they are but other than that this is a great app I use it to see where my kid's are and people I work with as well I feel better knowing they are safe"

      "i played this some time ago and just started again...it has completely changed. story, characters, set up. if you look at the video, that is how it was. it is so much different. i tried to restore my account...and im guessing due to this change edit:i have continued to play and almost at lvl200. im finding the story quite interesting with the main characters sister trying to buy the zoo and sabatoge it. the added flamingos is super cute.i also like the changed lvl challenges",
      "Honestly I want to give this game five stars but i cannot. The game hardly works it is constantly crashing and closing down. When it does this when I'm in the middle of a puzzle it takes my life's off me. Honestly I just want a game like this one that doesn't rely on lives. It's not like you game developers wouldn't get money out of it since you have to pay for most things in the game (boosters, coins ect) Please fix the game so it isn't constantly crashing and consider removing the life's.",
      "This game is ok to start with, but end up getting zoo points just to plant shrubs. Recently spent lots of zoo points, only got when finishing a level, to put snow in an area now to be tiled. Levels too difficult and do not want to spend 3 days getting 1 zoo point. The main character is very patronising when you log in. Hubby deleted and will do same in the morning. Waste of time! Only got 1 star as unable to give zero!",
      "They're giving more boosters on the board making it lots more fun than used to be! Now if they don't ruin by making it too hard that'll be great 😉😊!!but most games do seems they forget I'm playing for fun don't want challenging!!!",
      "The game is quite fun but I give it 1 star because you have the game set so that it ends with one more turn and you must use your extra points. 2 stars on the control because if you have a good move the piece goes the wrong direction and you are stuck again. Please loosen the game play and I'll be happy to give you 5 stars."

      "I love the game, but I think everything in the game is overpriced to the buildings and the land. It's ridiculous to still be in the beginning of the game and pay 10,000 coins for a small strip of land and I haven't even got to Joe yet. Either change the prices of items or up the number of coins characters give you for doing things. Then you make the quests rack up one after another but there's not enough room for items because land costs so much.",
      "So I've been playing this game for a while now. There's a part at the beginning where you can purchase a character to help with events. Every time I go to purchase it it disappears. Then when I go to see where the character is it not available/seen. I'm not sure what going on but the little glitches are frustrating.",
      "irritating clams game keeps saying hope you enjoyed the show and gives me 2 clams taking total from 35 to 37 yet every time i restart the game it does it again and 37 clams has become 35 again....... 03/03/2020 how stupid the blimp disappears after the 5th trip and doesnt come back? i got to admit it looks awesome in our quoahogs and now we the playes lose it for good? yet all the stupid unlockables have to be redeemed for clams???? you stupid democrats.",
      "Okay but not great like every time it has an update it becomes slow. Mine took forever to get out of the Valentine's theme. It just went to the Leprechaun theme and it's super slow, it didn't used to be this way. The cover still Valentine's themed please work on this game I love it but i don't love how slow the game has become and it messes with the phone itself.",
      "Here we go again, more problems. Been logged out of my account and can't log back in. Can't contact Tiny Co to get it sorted out, terrible service last time it took then 6 months to get it working again. Other issues: Takes forever to load. Gives you Clams at the start of the game and takes them away again when you leave just to give them back again when you rejoin. When you use Consuela it now takes several minutes to work and freezes the fame. Crashes out and shutsdown randomly."

      "The app takes a while to update changes and locations which can cause unnecessary alert. The time limits are unlimited between certain hours. It would be nice to have a certain amount of time. For this being a paid app, I am not satisfied with the performance.",
      "I cannot delete my kids profile. I was able to for my 1st child..when I go to delete the 2nd child, when i click the edit icon i do not see the \"remove\" instead the app crashes. This app needs more user friendly parental control including control of the kids devices volume. This app has many features however you need to find time look through everything. Make it user friendly, identifiable tabs on quick glance and key options up front. Give me the option to duplicate profile setting for kids",
      "Stupid app! My 5 year old child deleted the app accidentally when she was deleting another! It also took ages for my children to receive texts and allowed to be playing on their device's again. Super Slow! Do not install! I would rate this zero if I had the chance but the lowest is one! I would rate it a 5 if YOU FIX THESE PROBLEMS!!!!",
      "Kids easily bypass. Just yesterday found go incognito on web browser, search app click install without having to go to Google play store. I locked Google play store to prevent new apps. Also Samsung S7 multiscreen allows child to bypasses security completely. Probably assumes only one screen is open and only locks 1 of the multi screens. Assume macafee cant see other screen. An easy complete bypass. Even with the latest updates. Also kids just reply using notification screen to bypass app locks",
      "It was great at first. It doesn't have all capabilities with an iPhone which wasn't to big of a deal with us. I tried to get this on my daughter's computer which it said that it could but we never got it done. After the trial period I tried to set up paying month by month payments. They took my money but I cannot access the app!!! I have emailed with no response. I guess that is $8 I will never see again."

    "recentChanges":"Update includes &quot;Do Not sell my personal information&quot; link in compliance with CA Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).

      "When I started using it worked great. Then was constantly getting messages about devices not being paired but was still working. Notifications from settings quit working next. Then the app started crashing once before working. Now it does nothing but crash repeatedly. I have had this for over a year and liked that it worked even though it wasn't working as good as it did wjen i started but now it is useless",
      "I like that I can see where my family is, when the app works. Unfortunately it gives a lot of false notifications and stops working on my son's phone all the time even when it's been updated and installed correctly. Given the fact that you have to pay for this on your cell phone bill, you would think the app would work better. If it was more accurate and worked correctly, I would have given more stars and a better review. Definitely disappointed.",
      "Lastest update won't open on my Samsung S9+. Even after reinstalling it. Sucks to pay a monthly fee for useless app. Still have trouble making app work correctly. Had to close account. Will try to make a new one. Had to close my account and open a new one to get it to display correctly. We'll see how it works now.",
      "Really junk app that shouldn't cost you $$. Can't find phones ON THE SAME PLAN if they're Apple; repeatedly requires sending requests to family phones for permission to locate; finds phones sometimes within 300 yds, but next time 1.2 miles, but no indication the range changed that much. I need consistency, and accuracy in locating family phones. This app offers neither, and charges $10/mo for this poor service.",
      "App freezes nine out of ten times. Will not allow user to scroll through 'locations' or 'visited' features. Still cannot use app on my tablet, despite registering it as 'Parent'. Thoroughly dissatisfied."

      "Really wanted to like this fridge, but it is way too expensive for delivering such a subpar experience. As a fridge it works fine, but the overhyped tablet on the front of this thing is really not impressive, and this app is somehow worse. Keeps restarting because it keeps resetting the token. My kids love to draw pictures on the fridge, but there's no way to export any of them. I'd be better off mounting my own tablet to a standard fridge. Another swing and a miss from Samsung.",
      "I have tried everything I can think of to connect the app with the fridge (log out and in on the fridge, reset fridge, uninstall and install app on my phone). The end result is always the same. I am told to connect my profile on my fridge. It IS connected. This is super frustrating!!",
      "Deals can no longer be added from phone app and must be added to shopping list thru app installed on the refrigerator. How is this \"Smart\" and who has time to search for deals standing in front of the fridge? Older version of phone app allowed adding and browsing deals which is more efficient but went away with update. Very disappointed to say the least.... Please bring back this feature for a true \"Smart\" Device experience.",
      "UPDATE: Samsung responded and helped remedy the issue. I'm pleased to say it's working now! Thanks Samsung My husband and I have the same phone (Note 10+), purchased at the same time. He send I both hit an update; he had the new interface and I don't, WHY?? Now the shopping list, as one example, he creates on his phone does not show on my phone as it did before the update! Also, I keep getting there message: Family Hub keeps stopping...",
      "🎉🙌🏾It is a great app and I am so happy when it works. It is now working as of 1.24.20, thank you so much support team! 🙌🏾🎉 App is not working as if 1.1.20 It says it failed to register our fridge 😢. - My husband and I love this app and used it all the time for our new fridge. We got Google pixel 4's and there is an app available for us on this fridge. So happy! 🎊🥰"

      "This is a very nice app that is easy to use. Not difficult to edit, add children, spouses etc. My only challenge is the exporting of the data. One can only take shot of a small area of the work because of the aspect ratio. Everything blurs up if you try to widen the area to capture more details, rendering the output useless. Can this be worked on so a larger area can be exported or captured? Thank you",
      "I really like this app bcz it's very simple and easy to use but I've 2 suggestions for improving this app. First by adding more biographical information such as birthplace, deathplace, cause of death, date of marriage, occupation and etc while maintaining the easy-to-use concept. The second one is to show the family relationship in the family tree so that it is easy for everyone to understand. This is just my 20 cent opinion. Tq....",
      "I love this app. It's simple, easy to use, simple to understand, and easy to navigate. I use it to manage and keep track of my book characters. The ads aren't too numerous as to be annoying. The only suggestion I would say is to add the ability to go back until BC and not just AD, as I have Greek and Roman characters I can't add because of this. And to add the option of single parents, stepparents/children, and to show half-siblings. And where is the CP part of setting dates in the pictures?",
      "I loved this app, until a recent update removed my ability to type, which kinda destroys the whole functionality of the thing. Please fix this, as the thought of re-entering all my data again is rather daunting. Update: By copying the entire tree then deleting the original, I'm able to type again for some reason. Still kinda annoying, but I'll still give it 4 stars as it's a very good app otherwise.",
      "Amazing! You can click and choose gender of your person, you can have same gender couples, or one with no gender! It allows birth and death dates, a pic, and many more. I just have one thing you many wanna add to the app, a gallery. So we can have multiple photos in one person thing so we can go through and just look at that person's photo. I just think it would be cool to add! Overall, great app!"

      "My experience with the game is good, but everything takes way too long compared to the original one.. The game itself lags and runs incredibly slow and the fact it has to load after everything is ridiculous. There is more too it, but they cost too much and I don't want to have to invest real money in this.. Decent game if you want something to last for 5 years..",
      "It is similar to the original virtual villagers on pc but adapted for mobile...brings back lots of memories tho the controls will take some time to get used to....but that's just minor....over all they have added a good chuck of stuff and the guide is way better then the original....over all I can say that this will be the main game that I will be playing for quite sometime...give it a try...trust me you will not regret it",
      "Just as i remembered from the PC days. the game is fun, addictive and a great way to unwind and pass the time. cons: too many ads; when you open the crafting house, an ad pops up. secondly, the tech points are now way too high and some recipes take wayy too long to be ready. came back a week later to update: as soon as im done playing or maybe even earlier, i will surely delete this game. after the update of July 23, the ads have multipled. to collect a recipe, there's an ad. Is chapter 2 avail",
      "Addicted to this game, it's one that keeps you playing. Why is the game glitching several times I've opened the crate only to go back to the game later and find it there again like I didn't open it. Also many times I've created things in the crafting hut and gone back and it didn't go through. This is frustrating considering how long some crafts take to complete.",
      "I loved this game! But I was literally on the last two challenges gave my villagers the the glasses they needed to complete the statues. I had to close for just a second. Came back not only did the glasses not get put into the statues but the all disappeared from craft hut. All that time wasted! Very diesappointed! So disappointed I just gave up! I deleted my village and deleted the app! Mind you I was soo in love with this game I kept track of the families. I was 7 generations in!"
