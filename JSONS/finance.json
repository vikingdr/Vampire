      "Very underrated app. I love the clean design, the dark theme, and the ease of use. In general Yahoo Finance's coverage is also very good. The data/charts are presented in a very clear, understandable way. You can make watch lists, and you can filter for news that affect your stocks. Highly recommended!",
      "I gave it extremely good a year ago but today, it is extremely worst! Verizon bought Yahoo to hollow out the value? Just close out the app. It is now worthless! The version 9.2.4 does not respond. The articulation of interface is illogical! Extremely very SLOW! Did you guys moved someone from 1960 Engineering Dept to manage the app? What a sorry state of an app that used to be one of best if not the best in Finance! Just humane kill it and save us from the misery!",
      "Latest update makes it unuseably slow. Don't download. Update - The home page. As soon as i start scrolling down the page it lags hard. If I collapse my watch list, then it feels smoother. Update (03/19/20): Seems to be fixed with latest update.",
      "Hello Yahoo. the app is lagging after update. It's lagging on watchlist when I'm viewing live stock price movements. It's unusable. It moves very very slow. I can't even go down my watchlist because there's like a 10 second lag. The app works fine on my Chromebook because I'm using the previous version. Your recent update messed up.",
      "This was my favorite app until the latest update. Now the app is so slow and clunky. When i move up and down my watchlist it lags soo much. Never used to do this until i updated this week. Please go back to previous versions"

      "Full of bugs. When I remove an item from my portfolio and re-add it (so it will be at the top of the list) it says it has been added, but it's nowhere to be found! Today I signed into the Web version and tried to sync my portfolio. Well what do you know, another error! I am signed in to the app and Web version, but my watched items are not synced.",
      "Good app with accurate information. But it could be greatly improved by adding some dynamism. 10Y data would be nice, even if it would require the user to pay a subscription. Options to calculate growth rate for specific time periods would be a cool addition. Custom alerts for the watchlist would make a lot of sense; time to buy or sell? Set your notifications according to your preference.",
      "My watchlist has disappeard many times and is currently not appearing once again. I also get a pop up every single time I open the app saying that there were changes made and I need to merge or cancel. I never log out or try to do anything offline in the app... Without these issues the app would be a 5 star app. Its very intuitive. Edit: Was forced logged out and lost my favorites again, just going to use another app.",
      "What happened to the mutual funds on my Watchlist?? It won't let me add them back either. And what's with the pop-up saying I have made changes while logged out of the app when I haven't logged out or made any changes? The changes were made when they dropped my funds! This used to be a good app, but no more. Come on Microsoft, get your act together.",
      "First impressions are good.. suggestions are 1. Each stock info in the watchlist seems to take too much height...should be sale on bright with option to tap on it for more info 2. Please add the feature to reorganize the watchlist...lot of us have preferences on how we view how stockists opposed to how ot shows up here....first added goes to the bottom..."

      "Updated my rating to 5* because I was able to find all my past records for EACH category under Statistics>Reports. A very useful app. I now know: 1. How much I spent paying debts. 2. How much money I have in Total. 3. My biggest expenses and 4. I don't need to remember when a payment was made because everything is recorded in real time and easily retrievable. I'll buy the paid version. Thanks to the developer.",
      "I was extremely excited that you could connect bank accounts and have them sync on their own when you purchase premium. The reason I'm giving a two star rating is I could only get 4 accounts connected and keep them connected. We bank with Capital One and I was able to get it connected and then it just wouldn't connect. Target, Kohls and a few others just won't connect. Get your syncing fixed and I might come back. Going to request a refund.",
      "Decent enough free version, though there are a few problems. The biggest one for me is that the \"balance forecast\" appears to be counting my planned payments as positives instead of negatives - i.e. my landlord is paying me rent instead of the other way around. As a result the numbers are so wrong that it's almost comical. I have to use an excel sheet for this instead. There are a couple of things I wish were added too, like being able to separate expenses per day by category in reports.",
      "This is clearly the result of a competent team which cared about user experience. One annoying thing is that I \"can't delete record in connected account\". I'm tracking a bank account and two credit cards. It calculates all of the expenses from the credit cards twice - once for each purchase on the credit card statement, and then the monthly billing of the bank account as well. There should be a simple way to exclude a transaction from the statistics.",
      "Looked very good structurally and I could see a great future. But you have to keep connecting to the banks. One of my banks it cant connect now. But competative software can. It also doesn't cover all the banks I use. A competative product does a lot more banks. I have reported all this to wallet but wishful promises are never delivered. And I have bought a lifetime subscription. Shame on me. I cannot see why it is the editors choice still."

Also fixed crashes on app initialization and tab navigation for some users. <br><br>We’re always working on new ways to improve your experience with Mint. Let us know what you think by leaving a review!",
    "comments":[
      "This is a great app. You can link all of your credit cards, bank accounts, expenses and know how much you have. It takes some times to update after payments because it goes off of the financial institutions and their processing times. Once the payments are withdrawn. It updates your balances. This is how banks work. It's a great app and easy to use. You can set budgets for your expenses. I set budgets for fuel, fast food, coffee, cash, etc. The app recognizes your expenses and categories them.",
      "I'm changing my rating from 2 to 4 stars. The app has come a long way. The only thing that I'd like to see happen is the app being faster to recognize transactions in my checking account. Otherwise, great app with an awesome budget feature. You can really customize the budget and put transactions in whatever category you want or just go with the suggested category.",
      "Takes about two months to figure out the budgeting and how it aligns with your spending but since I've started using it in October I've been able to consistently save money and pay off credit cards. I have really enjoyed the bar charts to show when you are green, yellow, or red in terms of spending habits. I always used an excel sheet for budgeting but it is so nice to have an app auto update all expenses.",
      "I used Mint for a long time then it stopped syncing to my bank account in spite of numerous attempts to fix it. I'm sad that I will be looking for an alternative app if these problems continue much longer. Who has time to devote to figuring out the help system maze via Facebook or Twitter? Not me. I'm obviously not the only one experiencing this either.",
      "I like using the app so I can check my finances in real time. It works pretty well. Here are some things I'd like to be able to do. - rules carry-over from desktop version to app - ability to assign categories to pending transactions (otherwise, the app miscategorizes and we get a notification of over-spending) - modified: adding a new merchant is possible! Up'd my review to 4 stars."

Maybe Bloomberg could split the subscriptions in two, with a lower tier accessing news etc plus a limited number of more detailed market data each month, and a higher tier accessing more in depth market data, able to track shares, etc?",

      "Was a great app until the recent \"bug fixes\" and \"performance improvements\" now it doesn't work on my phone and crashes every time you open it. There are so many apps and websites this applies to: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
      "I have subscribed the premium from October 2019 and have been charged ever since automatically to the phone bill. But from November 2019, the app return to free version even though I paid it along with the phone bill. This is unacceptable and can be considered a fraud. I demand a refund from November 2019. Update: still not ad free. I want a refund please. Stop this mambo jumbo about technicalities. This is fraud.",
      "Between the full page ads on every load, and the broken premarket and after hours figures that just disappeared recently this is a strong pass. Many other apps out there with more features, less ads and just as fast with market numbers. This is a great example of a decent app, ruined by developer greed. Uninstall",
      "Tried to sign up 8 times with email and I never received a confirmation code. Absolutely useless. Just tried again and still won't send confirmation code by email. I did receive an email, but it would take far too long to fill in the information on their support request than it's worth. Absolutely useless with terrible customer support.",
      "Took hours to get the email verification email. The app had a window asking for the verification code in that email. But by then, that window was long gone. No way to enter the code or reset the password or finish the account registration in any way. Do some basic testing before releasing an app. Not worth my time."

      "Great app but the mobile version really needs UI refresh. Using (parentheses) around positive integers in the $ view is really confusing. The inability to Freeze a column and scroll is inefficient and frustrating. I could go on and on. Come on, developers, hire a pro UI design team and time-on-site will skyrocket.",
      "Great relevant news and data. It is the first place I check for market information. Only one issue: when tracking a portfolio, the app doesn't show the same quantity of holdings as reflected on webbrowser on my computer. The data on the computer is correct.",
      "Looks like this would a useful tool for many investors IF the shares you are interested in are listed. None of my shares are listed in the app (all London exchange, so maybe that's why i can't find them). Maybe one of the few worth a subscription, if your shares are listed. I'd suggest the makers of app focus I adding more shares rather than features now.",
      "Could be better but there's much worse out there. The private chat function ALWAYS completely kicks me out of the chat if I EVER hit the back button. That's the biggest gripe. A minor gripe would be it not being able to track my account and the app asks for my credentials to access some content even though I already logged in.",
      "Lots to like some features to expand. I like the short bullet point overview of each article. The news and info is up to date and timely. I wish I could have a bigger watch list and an easier way to find other articles that might be off topic for me."

      "I love this app for tracking my investments. Liked it enough to go premium. Definitely worth supporting the developer. I wish it could track upcoming dividend ex and pay dates. Maybe in an enableable column. I realize that isn't the main function of this app and the app is great without it, but it's a feature that I have to look elsewhere to track. I'd pay extra for this feature.",
      "Stock prices have an est 3 min lag. Otherwise would be graded higher. Features are superior to other like apps out there. The lag in live pricing is a huge detriment. The lag is on BITUSD. On weekdays, yes, its a few seconds behind. Maybe 5 to 10 secs. Transactions can also get murkey, esp when many. Maybe put the open and recent trades on top? Box off the closed trades, or paired off transactions? Cleaner trade log to read. There is lots of potential in this app.",
      "I have used it for about a month. Passwords are extremely annoying but if it could be as simple as some other sites such as capital one finger trace of a pattern, I would love to keep my data from the prying eyes such as a lost phone. Very thoughtful and easily learned.",
      "Good app for monitoring and for current news, but needs more options under the transaction tab to change the currency to whatever you like( Price per shares and commissions ). For example, if I purchased RY stocks, I'd like the option to change the price per shares and commissions to Canadian. Thanks.",
      "Good, but leaves room for improvement I tried to import account holdings in a supported format but ran into trouble. Some data was omitted, like the average unit cost of some holdings. As a result until I manually input the data the gain/loss info is erroneous"

      "Works well when it links accounts. It booted one of my major accounts off and now my information is incorrect and incomplete (for 6 Months). I have not been able to successfully contact support and resolve this issue. App is ideal otherwise. I'm looking, and no updates available. I dont know what to do. No phone support. When I did the chat support, no resolution.",
      "Post install setup flow is a bad experience. There is a screen where you can select the types of use cases you plan on leveraging the app for. I was planning on clicking a few but when I clicked the first one (credit score) it automatically navigated into the credit score setup flow. Upon completion it didn't take me back to select another one. So I then I linked my bank account and the account balances were incorrect. The app allowed me to unlink my bank account but not my credit score account.",
      "Love this app! I already knew about the website years ago and loved using them to choose credit cards. But this app really is a step up. It helps me keep track of my credit score, see my accounts, how I'm spending money, home valuation details and it give me information about how to improve my credit.",
      "Illuminating, finally an app that hasn't tried to sell me something in the first 10 minutes and let me just organize my finances onto one app. The Robo Advisors send you to pointed articles, and they're sized to answer thoughtful questions without information overload. Highly recommend.",
      "Constantly disconnecting from my accounts. It is getting pretty bad to the point where every time I check something is needing reverification. Please fix your app so I can go back to giving it five stars."

Anyhow, very happy user here :)",
      "Added three categories like newspaper, petrol and servant salaries. But they dont show up when trying to input expenses. Sorry I added these and these were under income Tab rather than Expenses. Thanks to the team for immediately clarifying. That was a super fast response and THANK YOU. March 2020 It's now over 4 months that I've been using this app and I must say that I find it absolutely fantastic",
      "Too basic. Edit: I'm not hating, I think it's a fair opinion. Your app, although useful to some users, is too basic (limited range of functionality) to appeal outside of a small niche, and my financial needs unfortunately do not fall into this niche, thus falling short of my expectations.",
      "A great app almost perfect for me. A useful feature would be the ability to set the Default  view that allows the user to see the finances for the whole financial year rather than just the default monthly view. Another useful feature would be the ability to take photos of receipts.",
      "Nice one. Could you please give us provision change the month start and end. Because we have different people getting salary credited on different days of month. Hence it would be great if we can select the month start and end. Update : thank you ! I am able to find it"

SECOND when you close it it blasts out advertising music that bothers everyone in the room. Beyond that, it's stock reporting features are excellent, but not any better than many other apps that are available."

      "All the news you get is great, you just cant share. Changed to s10+ from s8 and the complete action screen has usless choices no texting just email, continue on pc, bluetooth. Had Verizon look in my phone and found they couldn't do anything about it. That it must be the app not the interface of the phone which they suspected at first.... update..still nothing. Have reset the phone & reinstalled the app Nobody interested in communicating. Just there proprietary news I guess or they would fix it",
      "I like this app. It is very clean in that it presents a lot of info in an uncluttered way. The news section is informative with a good list of top stories. The watchlist section loads very quickly, easy to navigate, very straight forward to set up multiple watchlists. Top grades for this app. I also use it with tabldt and phone, all synched. Thanks!",
      "Excellent app that is easy to use. Even a novice, like myself, can easily be guided to set up a watchlist. The app has good clarity, provides lastest news & gives you the ability to watch \"on the go\" literally. This is my \"go-to\" app first thing on a weekday morning to check important market news that would relate to any investing.",
      "I do not like the home page what so ever. The website gives you news every 5 mins and on the app, it does not relay the same news. The same articles will come 30 mins or even an hour or more after. Please fix this and I'll give a better rating. It needs to be as good as/better than the website.",
      "Very easy to use. I use this App to track my stocks in multiple watchlists, and track the markets and the futures. Also, the news. As a new user, I am sure I am not using all the advanced features. But, I am hoping to get there soon. Thanks."

      "I'm using it more than a year.. So far it's too good to track my transactions. Accounts management, charts, filters all good. But I have a concern. On the investment options need to add an option for interest. If I transferred the amount(with interest) from investment, it's showing the excess amount as liability.",
      "Works well on Android 8. Comprehensive account management and transaction types. I do a lot of transactions dealing in foreign currency tho, I wish it were possible to specify the exchange rate at which each transaction was conducted. Also, the PC manager doesn't work at all for me. And the video showing a demo is from 2013.",
      "This app is wonderful if you want to track your expense diligently, you can set a budget, create a lot of categories and subcategories. It really made me be conscious of how i spend my money and focus on more important/valuable expenses. So far, i love it!! Thanks to the developers for this app!!",
      "Great app, probably best money/budget manager for android, however there's lack of few quite basic functions that it should have, like: - when entering new expense/transfer etc. option to enter amount in two currencies, because right now it forces to go to settings and change exchange rate before each entry that is multi currency (when you pay in a currency different that the account/card currency). - really basic thing, quite strange it does not have such option: a-z sorting for categories - another so basic thing that almost all similar apps have it: option to search category by starting typing letters that are in that category, not start but are even in the middle.",
      "Every thing is great. Only issue is there is no share option to share the details or data. Developers Please add share option which will help us lot. Thanks ***After response received from devloper*** I asked for sharing option but there is nothing mentioned regarding share option. Request u please include share option for every page so that it can be share with others. Thanks"

      "Great app that tracks investments much better than Mint. Update: They fixed some UI issues with graphs. My only gripe is you can no longer use a pin number to get into the app. Now you have to type in your password, even though this doesn't make it any more secure. Please bring back the pin option!",
      "Overall great way to consolidate all accounts into a single viewing tool, but poor execution/maintenance of the app - regularly now at least 2 of my accounts won't sync, and when I tried re-adding my Optum Bank accounts, they don't even have the correct Optum site as one of the options. Also no information on how to get help in the app.",
      "Latest update makes me enter my password instead of PIN. Due to the nature of the data I have a very long and easy to mistype password. VERY ANNOYING. Also, Ally synchronization is constantly hit and miss. Leaving soon unless fixed.",
      "Increased to 3 stars as it now syncs ally bank again. One problem is that now it requires a texted code every time it has to update... I use other trackers like mint and they still work fine.",
      "at first glance, it looks simple/basic; that's what it turns out to be, data driven and no frills! i can view all the accounts with each of their breakdowns by scrolling down the screen. it's also one of the most accurate apps to extract transaction names (least amount of work for me to rename them, while still an option). compared to some other free apps with tons of distracting paid content/advertising, this is a breath of fresh air! (only complaint is that it doesn't budget)"

      "It's a nice \"set it and forget it\" way to invest. Plus, I really like that you can set your account to automatically reinvest dividends. I had to change my review from 5 to 4 stars because the app is constantly logging me out.. so often that it's just really annoying. Also, if you edit a recurring transfer amount, I have come to find out that the date in which it is withdrawn from your account may also be changed so there's a friendly heads up on that small surprise.",
      "Overall, I am enjoying this app and think it's a great tool. Once you figure them out, pies are a nice way of managing a group of investments. And fractional shares is great and works well with the pie system. What I don't like so far (and what made me put this at 3-stars): I've had a ticket open for a few days now to close out an account I don't need opened. I've never put anything in the account, etc... So it concerns me that customer service on that simple task hasn't progressed. The 9am trade window is limiting. I know you can get M+ for a 2nd window, but the whole window system is limiting. If I have money in my account and the market is open; I should be able to invest. I'm not trying to day trade or anything, but it's like a slow crawl waiting to see when your trades go through. Otherwise, I'm glad I'm using M1.",
      "Overall I'm pleased with M1 finance and the app. Its responsive and the UI is easy to navigate. My only two complaints so far is the limited trading window that only allows you to trade once per day. Secondly creating multiple pies within pies takes some getting use to. Like all things with practice you can get the hang of it. Trading is actually free.",
      "It's been two days since I haven't been able to access my account. They haven't responded to any of my emails for support. I have called the support phone number at least 5 times today and each time I have been disconnected without getting through after waiting. So far as I can tell, they have just stolen several thousand dollars from me. This company is completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your money. I plan on filing complaints with the BBB and and CFPB if I do not resolved asap",
      "I use the app to get a quick glance at my portfolio. It will allow me to make quick changes if needed. But prefer the desktop for any real work that I may need to do. This app, company, is great for folks looking to build growth, cash and wealth over a long period of time. It is NOT for those into day trading. Perfect for those looking to park an IRA. M1 Finance, like any brokerage company, also provides and holds tax documents that you will need to provide your tax preparer or tax software."

      "It's a good app. A little hard to navigate and could benefit from some kind of AI to walk you through the initial set up and maybe stick with you a few months to get you completely lined out. Then maybe greet you again periodically to let you know about updates and give you some tips. Also the plus version is too expensive in my opinion just to link bank accounts and drag and drop feature mostly. Anyway it's what I am using at the moment to supplement my pen and paper budget.",
      "Waste of money. It worked seamlessly for the first month and now it does not sync with my bank unless i sign out, uninstall the app, sign back in, and put in a new security code every time. And now this week, even that doesnt work. The app freezes and stops working. Ive emailed the Ramsey solutions people and they flat out refuse to refund me my money. Update: Still a waste of money! Now my transactions sync again but 3x per one! So I get to manually delete 2/3 of the transactions! Yay me!",
      "I really like most things about this app. I recommend it because it is a useful tool for planning and tracking spending. However, I do not like the way the line items called \"funds\" are accounted for. I love seeing that I have an \"everydollar budget,\" but when I have a fund, it will still say EveryDollar Budget even if I went over in every category. There should be a popup that says \"You just overspent your budget. Please adjust.\"",
      "A great app! It would be greater if we could take a pic of receipt within the app. It's difficult for the user to confirm the budget category of each item if the user looses the receipt. Another idea: user scans the receipt and then app provides a recommended category for items, once the user confirms, the info gets placed into the current budget. It also needs percentage for each category. Budget categories based on percentage is at the core of the plan. Doesn't make sense to not have them.",
      "I've been using this off and on to track my budget which helped, but I've never really followed it and didn't enjoy manually entering expenses. I recently upgraded to the plus version which links your bank account. This has been magical! I'm now staying on budget and can look at what is remaining in each category wherever I am. Thankful for this app since it has kept me on track for paying off debt!"

      "My experience with this app has been pretty good, more than I expected. For a while I've needed to put myself on a budget. I took my time selecting an app that would fit my schedule and how I wanted to plan the disbursement of my monthly financials to adequately cover my living expenses. This app is extremely easy to use. You can take away, you can add, update your information on your budget effortlessly. I recommend this app.",
      "This app should have an option whereby you can allocate SOME of your income to financial accounts... The option available right now takes all the income gained to the financial accounts if you enter the account name in the add income option.. Also the home pages must show the amount of income you've saved in the financial accounts then the matching concept should take be considered in this situation too... I wish I could send images to explain better",
      "Good app, balance between function and simplicity. I rate 4 but since you guys so kind to open a lot of functionalities for free, it's 5 :). I have some suggestion: - The default value when clicking to budget should be add transaction, since we use it more often. - Add option to transfer the remain of budget to other budget. Sometime we know the budget is done and we can move all of it left fund to other categories. - calculator should show result in realtime",
      "From a Pro user! What happened to bluethooth sync? Why its been deprecated? Why not fix it? On my understanding the part that fails was all data from Financial Accounts, that never pases to the updated device! Now we have only two options: DropBox (which I don't like) and GoogleDrive. The only problem (the worst tha makes the app a nightmare) is that when you restore/syns from your files in Drive, the updated device now has all Financial Accounts, but shows all transactions as accounts!",
      "Hi, I have taken premium version of the app. It is a great application to use however there are apparent shortfalls. I would have loved to a section of loans apart from income and expense. Also, tracking of payees and payors is a bit confusing and can't be tracked at account level."

      "Like everyone else, losing money due to app issues. I went as far as to remove the app, download again, shut down, restart, and still having the same issue at this point. I can access any page on the app except the trade page, in till after 11:30 am. I attempt to go to the page and all that comes up is the green header bar and a blank white page.",
      "It was great! Until it crashes. And then it crashes every morning. And then it crashes on the busiest, most volatile day of the market and doesnt open for the rest of the day, and refuses to let people view anything in the app thanks to a hot patch. Seems everyday is getting worse on this app and they seem to offer no statement. Many people thinking about a class action lawsuit for gross negligence",
      "Takes forever for your transfer to come through; about 7 business days before your account sees the charge. Way too long! Then when it was supposed to complete, they say there was a problem with the transfer, that it was cancelled and I was charged a $9 fee. I checked my account in the day they sent that notification and had enough funds to complete the transfer. Opened a case and Eduardo said to get back to them in a month when my bank statement is generated so they can review. Ridiculous!",
      "So I figured I would give this app a try. Not looking good. It kept telling me it's losing connection, and then its having a server issue. Right after I put ALL my information in. Wont let you look at stocks. Just sends you to a blank page. So far this has been a horrible experience. Not sure I would invest money into this if you cant even navigate the app properly.",
      "Superb interface - Garbage Stability: This app is by far the most intuitive and beginner friendly option I've encountered. Unfortunately, the stability of the trading system is straight up garbage. Users were locked out of their account for the entire day of March 2nd, 2020; and the first half of March 3rd, 2020; during which the S&P 500 bounced up 8% from it's previous weeklong plummet. Do not trust this company with critical day to day trades, they have no qualms about shutting down the system"

      "I'm impressed, I didn't expect to qualify and did immediately despite having a low credit score which I'm trying to improve thanks to Possible. My only minor complaint is the 4 payment option is really 2 because 2 of the payments are scheduled for the same day. Still one of if not the best loan apps available. Helps in a pinch and builds credit, thus far I'm absolutely satisfied. Great customer service too. Thanks for the opportunity!",
      "Really easy process, and very quick response for my first loan. Had an emergency and needed to loan again, now I cannot view my loan or payment dates to make any changes. The app will load only partway and then I get an error message. This is so fustrating and I cannot reach customer service at all. There needs to be a better way to help customers!!!!",
      "Thank you! Amazing app that makes me feel confident using. I was sick with longterm illness so my credit took a hit with medical bills & drop in income for few years. My wife has been trying to help get it up a bit & this app is definitely a Plus for both building credit & helping out when in a tight spot. To top it off? I found out the headquarters is in my state. Awesomely Awesome! Credit score is climbing!",
      "Beware. Seems good to have access to borrow money with a reasonable bad credit interest rate. Unfortunately, when you have an issue they don't have a working customer service number and only email you back. The emails are somewhat generic; which happens often when you aren't talking directly to someone. I've wanted to pay off my defaulted loan for months now. I get emails telling me to do so in app and the suggestions aren't working.Don't deal with any company that doesn't have a customer serv#",
      "I've been having the same issues it seems like a lot of people are having. I've paid off one loan and I'm trying to get another one but it keeps saying link bank error. It's been two days now. You email them it's like talking to a robot. I feel like it's done on purpose. I don't like getting loans but this okay for me, not anymore."

      "Love this app. Multiple times he's live I can't listen to him due to work. So I can go on here and watch his show on my free time with my wife. Great content and several times he's covered topics that I was thinking about that day. No issues with the app so far, very solid platform. I have the Galaxy S9.",
      "Excellent app. Obviously the content is great. What I enjoy about the app is that it's easy to listen to the hourly segments of each show. The hourly segments are also titled, giving you a clue as to what Dave might be discussing. Works well, have never had any issue with it. It's becoming my go to app and podcast to listen to on my morning runs.",
      "So glad I gave this a try. I usually listen during work hours while I am working. The past few weeks, spotify has been having problems with their Windows app and mobile app which I usually use. This app has been working remarkably well for me. It has a modern UI design and has other useful perks as well. Will be listening to Dave's podcast using this from now on!",
      "I am a Registered Nurse and I work night shift. I finally have found something exciting to listen to on my way home in the car that keeps me awake and prevents me from falling asleep at the wheel. Best of all, there is no subscription fee (unlike audible for ex.) and the show is consistent in its message of obtaining financial freedom and full of golden nuggets of facts that keeps things interesting. If you enjoy talk about finances and how to better your financial future, this show is for you.",
      "Love the app. Love that you can download on Wi-Fi and then listen to it when not on Wi-Fi - important for someone like me who does not pay for mobile data on my phone. However, at times the app will say cannot connect to server and the app crashes. Would love to see this fixed. Also would love expansion of the categories the calls cover. Maybe there can be a special designation for \"comprehensive\" calls where the caller and Mr. Ramsey or the Ramsey personality cover something in depth."

      "Worked great at first. Good visuals and easy to navigate and understand. As soon as my payment for the 6 month subscription went through, it stopped syncing to my bank account and displayed the wrong information. It won't re-sync properly and I've sent multiple emails to the support team with no response. Very dissatisfied.",
      "So far the app has been very helpful. I was able to spot that I was being charged by Amazon Prime incorrectly and could then put a stop to that. The UI is easy to use, if not a bit of an overload sometimes. Also, being able to set budgets for individual categories and having summaries of spending is great!",
      "Great app! I don't have a problem with debt. However what this app has shown, quickly, is that I was quite wasteful. It's described by some as childish, other than the jellybaby I don't see how. It's basic yes. Once you've set up all your direct debits, payments into categories, set your budgets etc. You're all set. You can see where to save in no time. Easy to use, easy to save. No brainer! Highly recommended. Worth spending the time to set up correctly...",
      "Expected way more ; UI : Wonderfull & beautifull. UX : Horrible, not intuitive except for budget. Cash : If you want to track your cash expenses you need pro and even there its not intuitive. Merchant & subscriptions : Really cool and work well, kind of a great idea. Missing sub-category, any analytic chart. Bugs : didn't detect bank fees, my cheking account was merge with my credit card as 1 account. There might be potential for the futur but right now \"Wallet\" from Budgetbakers is way better.",
      "It's a very good way to keep an eye on all your accounts and cards in one place, they could even keep an eye on investments, pensions and savings accounts. I just wished more integrations would be available now with the advent of Open Banking, but some of them are being blocked by the banks/providers (e.g. couldn't get any savings accounts into Emma, although I had no problems with the current accounts from the same banks)"

      "Great App. I have just started using but it is very user friendly and easy to use. Only disappointment is that we cannot take photos of our receipts and then the biggest is because in Australia we use date as day month year and there is no option to choose this format.",
      "If you're a type A, this app is for you. Absolutely love it! Straight forward to use. Three best features would be: havng a budget for each catergory and seeing how much is left, cloning of budgets so you don't need to upgrade to use 're-occuring expences' and rolls over money left/'savings'. Literally does everything If i could chnge one thing- it would be to allow customisable colours, especialy for expenses. Would love it to be matchy matchy with my colour co-ordinated google calendar! 😍",
      "Love this app. Would like to see a transfer from budget to budget option like on the regular \" Isavemoney\" app. Very elegant looking, simple but does what i need. Love the sync option, without having to save all the time between devices.",

      "Free version is unusable. Doesn't have recurring event. Have to setup the same amounts each month. Forced currency. In other words, a sham."

      "IMPORTANT READ!!! Before you go and sign up make sure this is what you want to do. I created an account on 3/18/20 and during the process when you give your debit/credit they say they will not charge you but they do indeed even if you don't link your bank account to your profile so be forewarned this company's app is very deceptive it will charge you for whatever subscription you choose. I explained this to customer service that the charge was not authorized but they did not care or refund me",
      "If you're a pro looking for a super streamlined investment app with all the bells and whistles, look elsewhere. Stash is a no-nonsense long haul investment tool with educational media for people who want to invest their money without having to invest their lives in chasing market statistics. I love their no-nonsense approach to simple investing, and I plan to stick with them for the long haul",
      "It is true giving it 3 stars for now only because I don't see how you can withdraw the funds from your investments into your bank card if needed especially in these times unlike your competitor app (Acorns) just went to check it out and you could withdraw from your invested funds into your bank account with them. Do you think that is a wise financial option for the app user there's an obvious wall there to get to my funds if need be help me understand what is this overlooked fact please",
      "Awesome app. Great for beginners wanting to learn about investing as well as seasoned vets. Their FB page group is one of the most respectful and helpful bunch of ppl I've met online thus far. The only reason I didn't rate five stars is there are still some small glitches myself and others are experiencing from time to time. So there is a little room for improvement, but these are minor compared to the extensive and expansive options this app offer's, along with a strong support FB group.",
      "DON'T GET STASH!! They locked my already-existing account months ago for no reason. Made me jump through hoops to unlock it (uploading docs). The upload page didn't work. Support is awful; once they hung up on me. I was told to email the docs. I did. Nothing. When I call, they say they need more docs or more time to review them. (Why?) I just sent my ss card and they're saying the res is bad, but higher res won't email. Excuses! I still have no access to my portfolio at all and no recourse."

      "LOVE THIS APP! I've used this app for about 2 years already, and it has helped me keep track of everything! I love that I can see mine and my husband's balances together (we don't have a joint account yet), so it helps with budgeting. I just had my mom download & use this app too! I'm always on top of bills, but this allows me to pay all of them ahead of time at once!",
      "Ever since BillGo took over prism, this app has gone downhill. It used to update and work well with banks. Customer support used to be fast and efficient with any problems. That is no longer the case. Accounts no longer update. Capital One has not updated since 10/2019! Most accounts comment that bill payments are not reliable and should be paid outside of app to be reliable. The worst customer service is virtually non existent, nothing gets resolved. Prism was small team before. No excuses.",
      "Great app to keep track of your bank accounts and bills. It allows to pay bills for free. Unfortunately, there are still unsupported banks and the app does not provide enough warning for extraordinary charges like late fees and interests....edited in Mar 2020.getting better and better. A well deserved 5 stars!",
      "This app used to be so good, fast, responsive, collected all my bills, and showed me my balance at a glance. But it's all gone downhill in the past year or so. The app is slow, doesn't pull in all my bills, won't link some accounts, won't link to my bank account...it's really sad because the original developers were really good.",
      "Pretty good It keeps all my bills. All are synced. The only default is that i used the app to pay my tv/phone from Spectrum once and it never paid it. I had to contact them to make sure they didnt take it because i had to go on my own online to pay it. Still uneasy about paying my bills with the app. But it does keep me on track on what is due."

      "So far, so good! I've received my advanced after being asked a bunch of questions including asking your SSN just letting you know. They do ask that you put back at least $1 for what they call a rainy day fund which is withdrawn from your account attached monthly as well. I have not however used the Gold feature of the app, which actually asks that you expend more money to interact with that and I don't need that feature anyway.",
      "I have been using this app for about a year before deciding to rate it, and it definitely deserves a great rating. Using the app you have your own savings account accessible from your phone. You can set up multiple folders and decide which you want your money to go into and how much you want. You can set up an automatic transfer where Albert will pull a small portion of funds from your checking account and put it into your Albert account. Those are just 2 perks to this app, check it out.",
      "It's been almost 2 weeks, and their apps' system has not updated my account to use instant. They keep saying \"wait 2-3 business days\". Whilst telling me that \" our system usually fix this error in the timeframelisted above. But this situation is going to take a week. This happened right after they approved me for $75. The system somehow works when they charged my card the monthly fee 🤔🤔 . This app is doing some illegal stuff. And needs to be shut down. Until their system can work properly.",
      "Albert is very straightforward and easy to understand and use. They have a lot of cool features that you can take advantage of, and some that you normally would have to pay for at traditional banks to be able to utilize, but are free with Albert. Very convenient and a great job creating it. On another note: Finally a competitor to Dave. Don't get me wrong, they are both incredibly apps, my thoughts are that competition drives innovation which means more awesome features for the users to enjoy.",
      "I have had this app for a few months and I love it. It doesn't say it will advance me money I am not qualified for, like the other applications. It asks what my longterm goals are, it sets up a rainy day fund for me as requested, but they look at my paychecks and what bills are coming out and what I can spare and puts it in there for me which is nice. By far the best app of this nature I have used. Actually this is the first google app I think I have ever left a review for."

      "One main was quickly and easily able to get a personal loan done for me when no one else would give me a loan due to my credit score. Yes the interest rates and apr are a little higher but the process was easy and there were no prepayment penalties. Fast and quick service. I would recommend if you're in a pinch and trying to consolidate debt.",
      "Garbage app, doesn't work half the time when you try to log in. So I just wait for them to call when a payment is late. I figure if they really wanted on time payments, they could at least offer a functional product since they won't take cash payments in their offices anymore.",
      "Quick and Easy. Interest is a little high But thats Ok."

      "Extremely stupid app, with even stupider customer service. My bank account got hacked so I had to update it, and it's been several weeks now, and their lame customer service hasn't been able to do it. They literally can't update a f'ing bank account. This is their business! Bank accounts! At this point, I'm not so certain they're not the reason I got hacked in the first place. Edit2: I tried doing the phone call thing, and no one ever called me. Even that doesn't apparently work.",
      "I give it that score because of the issue with the credit builder plus. I have tried both my accounts funded by my salary and none work. This opps message is annoying. I also have ask and called, they say the banks are communicating with the app, check passwords and check the app version. I have done it all, nothing. Why offer this if it does not work for some banks.",
      "Customer Service is worthless but overall the app is good but in the same sense it's also bad. Won't let me add or update my credit/ debit card same card number just a different expiration date and security code. It says that the card has been added, but it never shows it. But other than that I'm somewhat satisfied with it. I wish they'd go back to the $1 a day login reward. Now I can't even switch banks, I wish you could just use a routing number and account number to add or setup a new bank.",
      "Keep getting errors...says I need to link my bank for instacash but bank is linked...tried to sign up for credit builder and keep getting same msg that it's my internet...also everytime I try to connect my bank (although my bank is connected in my accounts) it knocks out the other connections to my other financial apps such as Dave and brigit...very strange...tried several times..always the same thing each time...guess it's a sign to stay away..",
      "Not worth it all. If you use their Instacash feature Beware they will debit your account outside of your pay dates. I saw the date in the app was seven days before my pay date & reached out that the debit date was wrong. They told me everything was updated then a couple days later started taking out the exact amounts I had in my account leaving me with $0. They did this again the next day after 12 emails explaining this.They're response is it is automated and there is nothing they can do. AVOID"

They always seem to understand your problem never once have they helped solve an issue, and ive had several especially when it comes to hidden fees, service charge fees, and missing money. Its always \"i wish there was something i could do\" or \"we dont deal with that on our end\". And when u wana speak to a supervisor or manager guess what? They are🤦",

I tried all of the usual things, restarting my device, uninstalling & reinstalling Instant & it continues to crash \"instantly\" when I attempt to access Instant. Based on the reviews I've read on your app, this sort of thing is consistent with the issues a lot of people are having. It would seem this app is in dire need of an overhaul. When do you think that I'll be able to access my money? Any ideas?",
      "I haven't had this app for very long. However, I love how easy it is for me to receive and use the tips I get from work. I wish my instant card could be used online or/ and with Samsung Pay.

I put in my card info and press and card but nothing happens; this happens on the webpage as well. 5 stars if the \"Real-Time\" money transfer worked. How it gets fixed.",

So remember to instant financial it all together when you sync it with Google's app I already offer. It's all free at least the apps in the Google play store. Just remember to pay for some of the score. And that's not funny it's not a joke. It takes a lot of time and effort. To help the world all come up together. So let's love.

      "I really want to use this app with my partner, its exactly what we've been looking for - the problem is that while my partner, who uses an iphone, can set her envelopes' budget periods to be every two weeks, I dont have the same option on the android version of the app, only monthly and yearly! Its very annoying, and preventing me from using it effectively as my income is fortnightly - are there plans for this option to be added to the android version of the app too?",
      "Best budgeting app I've used by far. Very quick to load data. Doesn't ask for all of my personal information. Doesn't allow all transaction types from the app (income, debt payments, envelope filling) which is a bummer, but I use them infrequently enough that I can use the desktop version. Much better experience than Mint overall.",
      "Love the browser version but this App is seriously lacking. Can't see envelope balances when filling, splitting charges is a nightmare. The list goes on. It's like no one who developed the app ever actually tried to use it. It would be 1 star if I didn't like the browser version so much but seriously considering switching due to the app.",
      "The desktop website is great. However, the Android app is sorely lacking in features. The app completely ignores envelope groups, unlike the website which groups the envelopes in both the reports and in the envelopes list and allows you to collapse groups you don't want to see temporarily. I wish I could filter the envelopes on groups and filter transactions on accounts in the app. If I click on an envelope in the reports, I wish to see the corresponding transactions in that time range.",
      "Great app but I would like to know how to use it more effectively . I can't seem to tick off what I have paid in monthly expenses . So my income balance always shows a plus amount. It's not a realistic reflection of my money."

      "The app works as well as the website for Wealthfront. My problem is with the company. I changed banks and then got into a situation where I needed money out of my account. If you transfer any money out to any account you didn't initially fund a Wealthfront account with then the transfer must be reviewed by a team to determine if it is okay. I've even used the new account to transfer money in. They'll keep my money as long as they want.",
      "The app takes a while to get used too and you kind of have to play around with it a little bit. The linking portion is a bit slow and shows the wrong numbers sometimes. Over all the cash account really is the reason I use wealthfront and that is easy enough! So, if you're looking for some decent interest or tracking your financials it's pretty good.",
      "Very good app. Easy to use. Easy to get all of your accounts linked. Problems so far: 1) When I first signed up and invested into my account, they gave me an option for monthly payments then showed me what the projected account balance would be in 46 years. I clicked not now, and now it gives me the option to deposit but I dont get thay useful projected account balance bar anymore. 2) I have an HSA, the bank they use is Optum. You guys have an optum (Eflex?). Its not the right bank that I have.",
      "This app I been using for almost a year and I am pleased to say it's a easy way to have control of your money. I would love to have the option to have fractions buying and an individual investment account that I can add my self. But I love the simplicity of the app.",
      "Excellent planning tool (free to anybody), easy fund transfers, several investment choices, fantastic email customer service, Burton Malkiel is the CIO, app is intuitive, low cost. Not much to dislike."

      "This app is very simple and very well put together. However, I am giving one star due to the fact that when observing your annual savings chart, the app only factors in expenses (non-recurring) and not bills (recurring). This is a big problem due to the fact that a vast portion of everyones monthly expenses stems from bills. If this feature could be implemented, I would gladly return and give this 5 stars.",
      "I typically don't review apps however I found this one especially helpful. It has a good ui/ux and most of the functionality that is needed to quickly track and log expenses. I gave it 4 stars not bc a lack of quality but because I think that it could use abit of tweaking on the yearly/monthly savings overview. It would be nice if it showed a monthly breakdown of expected savings based on the bills/expenses that are recurring minus the recurring income. Other then that, timelybills is fantastic.",
      "Great app, really easy to use and track your expenses. Only downside is it only seems to summarise and report on a calender month. If you are paid any other way than on the last day of the month, the great charts are not much use. If you could set a start and end date for the period you wish to track, I would give this five stars and pay for the upgrade to ignore ads.",
      "I am about 80-90% satisfied with this app. It is the only one I was able to find that does NOT connect to any of my bank or credit card accounts. I am just NOT ready for any apps to have direct contact to any of my personal business as there are a lot of them that does. I rather enter any information manually. The only other thing I would like to see with this app is the ability to see my running balance as to how much I have left to spend on the home screen. This is very important to me!",
      "Very nice and neat app, love it! Paid for the ads-free version on third day of use , totally worth it. Potential enhancements: finger print or facial login, allow to backup at google cloud, after upgrade to ads free version show more features on dashboard, like budget and settings, since there is more screen real estate, also after ads free upgrade push some useful articles on dashboard, such as good money habit.. Bug: top right 3 dots -> settings -> any option -> go back, it goes to main dash"

      "It's great app that has all of functions that I want. I'm happy with it and have been using it for a couple of years. But there're some bugs along the way of usage. Eg. App delayed synchronizing with my bank account and eventually stopped synchronzing, sometimes when I tried to edit my wallets the app pulled me back to the previous menu. And there's one time weired incident which is the most frustrating one is all of my records had gone away which I'm not sure whether I did something wrong.",
      "I don't know what the issue is, I can sign in but the first sync always failed. 'unfortunately, we are unable to fully download your data. please try again later.' Need to several trial of sign in to success. Then after minutes using it suddenly I signed out and need to sign in again. And the issue repeat. I plan to try this app because there's interesting feature such as web sync. But I think I'll stick with my app that I havd been using for now because of this issue",
      "Better than others.... Debt manager is one unique feature.... But, one DRAWBACK is when I add transaction as transfer from x acc y acc, tha transfered amount is considered as EXPENSE in x acc... And due to which it shows monthly expense higher by including all transfer amount... In case this will be fixed, then this is the best app to track daily, monthly expenses.... Because of that one drawback I left this app.",
      "I paid for a premium user. Now I have problem with App synchronisation. Most data recorded was mixed up and all of the sudden it it was all gone. Okay, I decide to adjust the balance again to start over again but.....again the App start synchronizing again. Can you please fix this problem. It's so annoying! I have paid for this.",
      "From a premium users view: For the amount you pay the app looks outdated, No materialistic design, Not enough icons to choose from, No dark mode, Looks dull. Important features that's missing: * When expenses is added to 'A' wallet & later u want to move it to 'B' wallet that not possible. * Credit cards are considered completely separate from the main wallet. This should not be it because at the end of the day. Credit card bill is payed from the main wallet. With correction it's a 5* app"

      "Almost perfect. One missing feature that would bring it to 5 stars would be the ability to have recurring bills auto deduct or at least have scheduled bills deduct when the calendar reminds you, after confirming the amount of course. Love having the ability to share this appp with my wife so we both always know what's in the account.",
      "This is the first app my husband and I have LOVED while budgeting together. It offers the perfect amount of information, notifies us of bills, and tracks our individual card changes. My only critique is that we're unable to adjust the way the calendar counts a \"week\" currently it's Sunday to Saturday, however, and option to start our week on payday would make or budgeting more simple.",
      "great to stay organize and budget with your partner! this is the only budget app that really works with my partner and I. I have tried other budgeting apps for couples and it just doesn't seem to work as great as this one. I find myself keep coming back to this one!",
      "There is no search option when looking for paid bills I can see after a year or so that I would want to see what I paid for a bill to compare. Shoukd have a search box to find the bill. Also I should be able to interact with the bill calendar by tapping on a date to see what's due.",
      "At first it accepted all banks but one. Then after a few weeks I would have to reauthorize the accounts. If you have a bank account that makes you enter a security question when you log into the bank, it won't sync with Honeydue, from my experience. And now it won't ever log into the one I need to see the most..."

      "The app is easy to navigate. I love the products they offer and their customer service, but the app is down to do routine maintenance more often than I'd like, leaving you to have to call in. I also don't like how long it can take for pending transactions to be posted. App can be a tad bit slow when navigating from screen to screen, but generally straightforward and easy to understand. Love it 9/10 times.",
      "I love everything about Discover. This app is really user friendly and makes it easy to do pretty much anything you might need to do. Additionally, Discover is, by far, my favorite credit card. Their customer service is unrivaled. And they have a savings account available to cardholders with an exceptionally good interest rate -- I think it's around 1.7% compared to the 0.36% offered by BofA. I don't have a single complaint about any of the services Discover has to offer.",
      "'Our services are temporarily unavailable' probably 3 out of 4 times I try to pay a bill or do anything else on this app. Can't set up my fingerprint login either for the same reason. If I have to set a reminder or calendar event for when I MIGHT be home in order to drag out my laptop to use the website through there.... then this company is not worth doing business with. Chase card .... here I come.",
      "Easy to use, with all information you may need in menus that are easy to find and pretty intuitive. Never had it crash. Never had issues with security. Virtual assistants are very helpful to answer general questions pretty much immediately. No complaints with this app or my experience with the company. Very appreciative customer 😊",
      "It was working fine and then there are errors. I waited for the error to be fixed but it still doesn't take my payments and I couldn't message help on the app. And I am currently abroad now. Also, I changed my password twice and I still cant login to get in my credit card account like I normally did before;I have to reset and reverify over.. If this not get fixed, I may have to consider canceling Discover."

      "I have been using the app for a few days now. Quite interesting the way the report of my spending and savings is showed. I do like the app so far, however, there's one big mistake in my opinion. What is the purpose of the password/finger lock option if when I go to the manage apps screen I can still see some personal information (as if I were on the main screen before switching apps for example)? I wish the screen was blank on the app manager screen just like Google Chrome do when you're using incognito windows. If the developers could add this to the next update would be great :)",
      "Love using this app. It it very user friendly and you can categorize everything to your liking. I chose to pay extra for the \"Plus\" plan which allows more budgets... I like that I can have multiple budgets for different things like bills, vehicle, groceries etc. The notifications it gives me when im getting close to my budget or went over budget helps me keep on track. Wish there was a way to set up something other than a wallet for a credit card for example.",
      "I have started my free trial but have yet to be able to connect to my bank to even give this app a try. Everytime I try it gives me a screen after my password that says \"please select the contact information you want to use to log in\". Then a line, like I'm supposed to know what that is. I've tried entering \"text, \"mobile\" my phone #, \" \"cell\". Until I try a few times & it wont even let me connect again. I'd like to try it but cant even get past the 1st part",
      "Overall - nice but very buggy. I am using Spendee Plus plan and at some point it stopped synchronizing shared wallets. Every new transaction or edit causes an uninformative error message to pop up. Tapping on \"Contact customer support\" offers you to send a message to one of your contacts via any available messenger, the message is \"Need your help\". Seems like the users are supposed to help themselves...",
      "Tried Premium, but it wouldn't reconnect to my bank account with Halifax after the first day of setting up the app. I tried contacting technical support but never got a reply, only loads of spam emails. Can't understand how this is a paid subscription when the app doesn't work and there is no attempt to fix the connection issues. Edit- thanks for the quick response, I sent the email through the help button on your Web app. I also filled in a form sent to me by email about bank connection issues"

      "Lot of issues with this app lately. Extended hours does not update properly, either shows 0.00 or last closing price. Loading charts is equally as iffy. Etrade needs to fix this app, it used to work fine. Too many technical issues now that can cost you in trading. This is on the latest version 7.9.",
      "Lags horribly. Very unresponsive, it's cost us a good bit of money at times. TD app and platform was much better. Crashes often, specifically when you go to sell and try to delete the number if shares.",
      "This app is beyond broken. It crashes every time you open the \"Help\" menu, it takes almost two weeks for money to transfer from yoyr bank account to the trading account, what money you do transfer over will randomly disappear, and the layout of the app itself is beyond inept, which requires needing to use the \"Help\" menu, thus causing the cycle of frustration to begin anew. Nothing makes sense, and if you are a first-time investor like myself I would absolutely NOT recommend. 0/10",
      "App worked great when I could actually log in. Problem is that I have to enter my VIP token, a separate app, and when I switch back from the VIP app, my user name and password disappear. So no copying and pasting. And since the token expires after 30 seconds (vs 60 like every other token) , there is not enough time for me to reenter the information before it expires. Hence the app is now quite useless.",
      "Nothing but problems right now!!! Everytime I launch the App I get an error message that states none of my data loaded. I cannot see any of my account, can do nothing! Obviously other users are having the same issue. I cannot understand how a major financial company like E*Trade cannot keep there app running. Super frustrating!"

      "I use this app to track categorized spending. In that way it's really good at keeping me within limits. The 'In Your Pocket' feature is helpful. Not very intuitive to find previous months spending but not hard either Edit: after months of more use its done quite poorly and is glitchy at pulling in transactions. The support team was consistent and friendly in following up but really did nothing to fix the issue. The features make it a potential 5 star app but they have a lot to fix first",
      "Good for a baseline idea but not easy to keep going. Does not do well with consistent synchronization of income which constantly gives alerts as if ur not paid changing overview report into giving you bad data. Most likely will cancel my premium subscription if this cannot be resolved. Otherwise its pointless to keep using app.",
      "Easy to setup and shows me what I need to see: After bills, how much I can spend that month. I've tried every other budget tool and they are complicated and time consuming to manage. This one is really easy to setup and use and so far I'm loving it.",
      "The ideas behind the app are sound and the simplicity is really nice, but upgrading adds little to no additional features. It took several months to not require manually reconnecting banking information, there was a bug that caused some duplication of transactions (that has yet to be cleaned up) and generally a lack of some basic features make this app little better than a spreadsheet. The main reason I am deleting is due to the horriblely non responsive customer service.",
      "So far, I'm loving this app. I've downloaded and deleted at least 4 other budget apps. All I wanted was a simple, organized look at my bills and spending habits. Every other app complicated the process, so it took me hours just to link my accounts and set up my profile, only to find irreconcilable issues and being at square one again. I haven't had those problems, this app is easy and straightforward, takes you step-by-step through the process so you understand each function."

And I would love the option to add notes to me expenses, not just the description, to have a larger box to make a list with all my spending inside the expense would be wonderful",

Also please consider for premium being able to have a second to switch between, that way I can keep my billing and spending accounts separate.",

Keeping the financial record straight and as clear as possible is very important to me. Great job!",

Have now used this app for a bit longer and liked it so much I upgraded to premium, not disappointed, still simple to use. And worth the upgrade.just one suggestion would like a password to use the app as my phone is used by other members of my family.rate it 5 stars.One quick update, have just gone back through all peoples comments , not one negative one."

      "Great app to track your expenses and savings !! Transfer feature can be better modified to categorize into payments & savings. If I'm transferring amt from chequing acct to credit card or savings acct, then pie chart simply shows transfer icons, that makes it difficult to identify whether I have saved money or made a payment. If I choose to + or - the amt from an acct, it should be ask me from which acct money is coming from or going to. This will reconcile both the accts, which isn't happening.",
      "Pretty good app, but two issues that if fixed would make it perfect. 1) Weeks calculated as month divided by 4 so as there are more than 28 days in most months you could stick to budget each week you still ending up over spending for a month. Calculation should be 1 month * 12 / 52 to accurately create a weekly budget. 2) you can't change the start date for calculation so if you want to draw a fresh budget line you have to purge all your old data.",
      "Definitely best way to keep track of your money! I would like to see an option to hide seeing your transfers though. My transfers are always much higher than any of my other expenses, so my expenses are always red with transfers. But other than that, there's no problem with the app!",

When I press the button to pay for the pro version, it says I'm already signed up for a free trial of the app and my order is being processed, but still can't use any pro features",
      "Have the pro version. If the good work on this app continues I don't mind the annual subscription model. I Moved over from another spend tracking app that had not been updated in almost 2 years. Very happy in Toshl, life is too short for crappy UI. I have yet to try the web/desktop version... I'll adjust my review after I do Budgeting is easy, and the tutorials are really helpful. I admit I like the notifications (reminders for the scheduled or recurring awful stuff - the joys of adulting).",
      "I spend a lot of time to write detailed payment info with pic, text and pdf files, but when I confirmed it disappeared. It is a waste of time. Edit: problem was solved by deleting the app and re installing it then logging-in again. I am not sure what was the issue exactly.",
      "Have been using this app for years but one has to pay to input recurring expenses, which I found to be frustrating, as I don't need the other bells and whistles in the paid app. Look for alternative apps if you need to set up recurring expenses.",
      "Seems to work great. But I added my recurring incomes/expenses manually only to discover I can't make them recurring, requires me to pay. I'm sorry, but that's very basic functionality I won't pay for, making the app unusable. Haven't connected to any bank accounts, I pay cash. Visuals look good."

Dont waste your time or your info.",

The cashback feature is great, you can choose to apply it to your balance. The app itself is very user-friendly... cute, even. I'm not sure how the customer service is because I've never had to contact them, but most of your problems can be solved on the app itself.",
      "Ridiculous that it takes a full week for my payments to be reflected in my credit availability. Capital One takes at most a couple of days. Others who have commented about this all received the same boilerplate response, stating the problem as if that's the answer, that it can take up to a week to show up in your available credit. Well, duh, that's the issue. This card and app would easily get 5 stars from me if not for this major flaw. Having stated all of that, I am grateful for the card",
      "UPDATE!!! I LOVE Petal:) it's amazing, because you can budget out your spending and track it and you don't really need to use the payment options, all you need is to wait for your monthly statement like most credit cards, I got approved for $1000. I'm so glad that I have been able to use it. The only issue is, I cant use an ATM or withdraw money or do a credit card transfer, I'd like to do a transfer so I can put some in my emergency funds, oh well.",
      "LOVE my petal card and account! Just keep your debt ratio within safe limits, practice safe habits with it's use and voila. Earn cash back on purchases too! The app is smooth, the UI is spot-on, I have no complaint whatsoever. Thanks for giving me a shot at healthier credit, Petal!!"

    "comments":[
      "The Investing portion is good for long term investments, but delayed price updates make it bad for day trading. The bank account is pretty good with a lot of benefits, but the interest rate keeps dropping and is no longer one of them. The Relay product is somewhat lackluster but is always improving. Can't speak to their personal loans as they keep rejecting me. No student loans to refinance so no review on that either. All in all, I really like this company, just as long as it keeps improving.",
      "Amazing simple and intuitive. Keeps me on budget and I actually know where the money goes now! Enter all spending as it happens, then sit down daily and pay off the card I used. No balances outstanding, no starting every month having to pay off last months credit card bills. Finally, I'm not starting out in a hole. Got my son using it, and he loves it too. The lack of being linked to a bank account is a PLUS as with automation, you don't really notice where the money goes. AWESOME!",
      "The app refuses to remember my log in email address, despite checking the remember me checkbox. I guess the remember me check box only makes it so that the SMS code doesn't have to be entered again. In addition, there's no support for finger print authentication. This adds friction to getting into the app each time I go to use it.",
      "App is worse, have to re-login everytime I use the app. Swap to another app for 2 seconds? Login is required. Also, I still get the application being reviewed notification when I try to look at my account. I am able to get around it by going back to the main page, then back to the money section. But this has not been fixed since July (when I initially emailed Sofi about it) The mobile app is by far the worst thing about Sofi. Which sucks, because everything else about Sofi is great.",
      "Love sofi and the app has always worked well. Most recent update broke fingerprint on Samsung s10 5g, says biometrics not enabled on phone but works for all other apps. No permissions for biometric to change in app permissions. Please look into this I despise pins. Edit: fixed within a short time after, had issues editing the review. Thanks sofi for the quick turnaround."

The whole purpose of using this app is defeated if I cannot login to another device and view my expenses. Very disappointed.",

My only problem is that I can't sign in or connect the app to my facebook or gmail. I hope you can do something about it!",
      "Great, easy to use app to just track where your money goes. What does annoy me: you cannot set date range. We don't all get paid on the first or last of the month. If my month runs 15th - 14th, I am unable to properly track monthly expenses. Wish this would be fixed. Then 5 stars from me!",
      "Such a great UI. The best interface and convenient to use. Had fallen in love with the whole operation. But despite may negative reviews the developers are ignorant of the login issue. Please atleast respond so we know you're working on a fix. Don't ruin your whole product just because of such a simple issue. Please fix it. I myself am a developer and know how important a product is to a developer. Please care about it. And care about the what your consumers think.",
      "Love this app. I am only just getting to really use it now I have moved out. It has an easy pie chart to work out where all your money is going. It will also have the amount you spent and a percentage. I learnt 46% is a bit high for my household bills. Bit have paid a one off insurance for a car. So this will vary monthly. I'm not the best with money and find It hard to save. It would be a good idea to be able to add 2 savers accounts. As I don't mix my main account with the savings ones."

      "The trading app is absolutely riddled with bugs. Every time I blink I have to re-log my. It will log me out mid trade. The bid/ask prices are different depending on the screen you are on. On the trade screen, I will see two seperate tiles of the same stock, with different prices. If you lose connection for more than a few seconds, the app piles on errors that all stack. I have had to click ok on no less than 30 errors before I cleared them. Then it makes me re-log. Ally ruined the Tradeking app.",
      "Used to love it, now I cannot access the app or website via VPN as of late Feb 2020. I've also had issues with the mobile check deposit failing after having no issues for years. I frequently connect to unsecured networks at coffee shops, offices, etc, so no VPN support is a dealbreaker. If this continues I'll take my banking elsewhere.",
      "On the snapshot the information that is supposed to be useful (lightbulb between total balance and individual account balances) is not. It is telling me I have transferred money. It says the amount and number of supposed transfers but that is it. I have not transferred any money recently and the lack of context on what transactions it thinks are transfers is quite annoying. I do not find this helpful at all how it is. Please fix things with 3rd party financial monitoring services too.",

I have to login as many as 100 times a day! If you like logging in constantly, this is the app for you. You can go through all the steps necessary to make a trade and just before you push the buy button, please reenter your password. Then you have to exit the app completely, start the app, and start over. Rate 0",

You can see at once from the summary view the way your money was spent, total sum and percentage structure for categories, balance on accounts, as well as overall balance.\r\n\r\nThe synchronization between Android phone, iPhone and Windows laptop is an amazing feature. I would suggest anyone who is looking for personal account software both for Mobile and Windows - Albert Dsilva\r\n\r\nThe concept behind the program lies in grouping expenses and income into categories. This is useful because one can see where money is going and how much is spent at a single glance, without the need to examine the reports. The system of categories is designed as a tree that may have the unlimited number of sub categories. Each category may fall into sub categories, each of which may further fall into more sub categories. Additionally, expenses and income can be grouped by family members, payee and assigned special tags. This allows the user to see the flow of money in general and then drill down into details.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\n• Synchronization between multiple devices (Android, iOS and Windows PC)\r\nSeveral users can work with a single database and sync changes over the Internet.\r\n\r\n• Entering recurring data with a single click\r\nYou can enter recurring transactions very quickly, simply type first few letters and select a transaction from the list of frequently used transactions, and then the program fills data to all fields of the form. No need to enter the same data over and over again.\r\n\r\n• Password protection and user accounts\r\nYou can protect the database with a password. No one can see the details of your financial life. Several people can work with the database. It allows you to track users who create transactions, protect transactions from changes with a password and hide them from other users.\r\n\r\n• Currencies\r\nThe program supports an unlimited number of currencies. Initially, the list already contains almost all currencies of the world, plus precious metals. Also you can add your own currencies, including \"virtual\" ones, i.e. you can keep track of money and other things (metals, petrol, units of measurement). Exchange rates can be downloaded from Yahoo servers.\r\n\r\n• Accounts\r\nThis is the main way of separating transactions in the program. You can create any number of accounts, such as credit cards, bank accounts, cash, electronic money, etc. Accounts may be grouped.\r\n\r\n• Categories, family members, payee, projects and tags\r\nThe program offers many features for organizing transactions – division by categories, family members, payee and projects. Each transaction can be defined with many tags.\r\n\r\n• Scheduler\r\nThe scheduler lets you create recurring transactions automatically. These transactions will be created automatically, without any user intervention, or with his confirmation, if needed.\r\n\r\n• Budget\r\nThe program makes it easy to monitor progress in achieving your financial goals and control expenses.\r\n\r\n• Loans\r\nTracking debts and credits.

      "Using this app for last few months to keep track of family expenses incurred by any of the members. You can post your expense and sync to keep it accessible across all the accounts linked to the group. There are many apps for expense tracking, but with such sync facility within group is not there. So far, a good useful app.",
      "EDIT: after support from developers, the app is working fully again. Thank you. Original review: Last update made things impossible. My database file became not openable (says 0 Kb) I tried to open the file again from dropbox but when I click open I only have OneDrive and Google Drive showing up. Went to Dropbox and could finally open (activated automatic sync and allowed). All transactions since November are lost, however in my wife's phone it is working (we are using the same database). When I click sync it says done however when I go to dropbox the files are not changed at all. I'm a long client (more than 8 years, with Windows version) and now I can't just use it.",
      "This app is interesting, I love it. I suggest that it should be open for user's gmail account, so that any time to recover when needed.",
      "Got some issue Alexander helped to me how resolve it. Good support experience. Had couple of queries about automatic SMS recognition. New to this app. But I am sure it has some great potential.",
      "Amazing app! Sync setup was bit confusing at the beginning. But after i got it woking i coud not belive how esy it was. Money well spent!"

      "This is a great little app. Very simple, straight and informative. Quick too. And easy to use graphs and analyse. Mainly intended for US Equity investors, therefore lacking on non-US funds and fixed income. Also it is hard/impossible to compare performance. But small size, speed and speediness beat the small drawbacks.",
      "I love this app. Especially the news feed!! But the only downside is that, i am not getting alerts/notification when there is a new article published against a company. I have to go through all companies in my watchlist from time to time to know the articles published against them. Instead, if i get a push notification when there is a new article for a company being tracked in my watchlist, it would be awesome!!",
      "Free version has a 5-trade limit, and you can only trade each symbol once. Starting a trade and not finishing it also counts as a trade, apparently. Delete and move on. Also, info is slow to load on 4G. Any website loads 10x quicker on the browser. Best feature: does not require logging into anything.",
      "a fantastic starting place for quick and dirty ticker data. there may be others, but the resources (on the free side) will have you considering the premium version.. especially if the stock market is part of your finance/billpay strategy! good job guys!",
      "Last updated June 2019, but they charge 1$/month to use without ads. This app needs to be 1$ to remove ads. If you're charging 1$/mth you should have an update every month at least. It's a good app to look at candle charts, zoom in zoom out, make lists... But missing a lot of features. Search isn't the best, some tickers don't show."

      "They can provide you with a pretty big amount of money and the percentage isn’t TOTALLY high. This is a very good service! I took out a month loan in the loans application. My request was approved instantly; the money was transferred to the card quickly as well. I returned the debt faster than expected, and I got the interest back. I was pleasantly surprised by this behaviour. Moreover, I was offered to improve my credit history. Not an app, but a fairy tale. Very attractive application. I always say thanks to the authors of it. They simplified the life of everybody who uses this payday advance tool. The thing you should do is apply the form and wait. And even not so long. They answer very quickly. They approve your request and later you have your money on your card. My mental state is at its worst right now. I have prescribed some very expensive medication which is inaccessible within the country, so the shipping adds to the cost of the pills. To help myself out a bit, I use the loans application. I try not to overuse it, though, because I know how addicting it may be. Hope the dog days will be over soon. I don’t LOVE asking for money from my friends and relatives because I feel uncomfortable after that. That’s why I prefer using payday loans. The procedure is easy and understandable.",
      "The best app for money loans! YES! It is a good service that provides money when you need. There is one good thing about it. If you don’t LOVE anything, you can cancel a bargain without any trouble. It is possible to go back, you can just close this payday advance ap. When you start it again, this payday advance ap offers you to begin a new deal. It is an advantage. this payday advance tool is good. It is made by smart and creative developers. The interface is simple and intuitive. Moreover, if you fail to fill in the form, this payday advance ap will ask you to check all the fields of filling the form. You can’t do it when you are filling a written form. If you forget anything, it will be confusing.",

      "Oh yes! money loan is where its at!! Constantly use the loans application when I’m up against the wall. They never refused to lend some money when I asked for it. The fees aren’t high, so it’s not scary to use this payday advance tool. I’ve used many other apps but this one seems to be the best for me since their conditions are acceptable and very client-friendly. Recommended! MONEY LOAN 🤑 is the best unlike other apps, this one has the most adequate policy in my opinion. They put it very straight, so there’s no chance to mess up. I’m very clumsy and inattentive, but everything went quite smooth. I couldn’t believe that finally, I don’t need sweat profusely to get the money and not lose all my nerve cells.",

      "So far this has been a good app. I love the fact of no charge overdraft fees. and they seem to have a good system put in place to help everyone involved, not just getting their pockets fat, like most banks, with all the extra fees, and NSF charges. I never understood that if we had the money to pay NSF charges we wouldn't be needing help in the first place, then they say it is a courtesy service, no its not, we have to pay $35-$38 even of its just 1 cent over, now explain how that is courtesy",
      "I feel like this would be a great banking account for me... if I could actually open an account. I have been trying to open an account periodically for over a year now and get everytime I get a \"we're sorry\" message with the promise of them adding new ways to verify identity soon but it still has not happened. Even tried creating a new account in case it was a mistake but I cant use my phone number because its linked to an account that doesnt even exist.",
      "I have to say, this card and app are phenomenal! I am a regular hardworking guy who, got tired of being screwed over by the big banks. Chime makes it so easy and you don't have to pay fees. They have tons of ATMs that are free to use and if you use an ATM out of the network, 90% of the time they refund you the ATM fee. Also, the direct deposit really is early. I get paid on Fridays, payroll is done on Thursdays and on that same Thursday by 8pm my money is in my account! Freaking AWESOME",
      "I had chime since 2016. They were great, until last year. In 2019, their whole system went down for almost 4 weeks. I couldn't access my money or account.. along with all other chime users. we couldn't pay bills or buy food. Alot of people vowed to stop using chime - I should have too but I gave them a chance and in February 2020 my chime card expired. Chime never sent me new a card. I had to manually request a new card on March1st. 3 wks later & I still have no card. DONT USE THIS BANK",
      "I love using the chime app it is very awesome!!So far so good I never had a problem with me funds depositing into my accounts,maybe once are twice I tried depositing two checks into my account and Chime did not except the checks for what apparent reason I don't know why?And I love the overdraft it really comes in handy but wish they would are could go up on the spotme limit it says 20.00 to 100 how long does it take for Chime to go up on the Spotme limit??!"

    "recentChanges":"You can now use Sign in with Apple to login to YNAB on your [looks at phone] Android phone. Hmm...we realize you&#39;re not the target demo here, but at least now you have the option! Also, we made a ton of solid bug fixes, such as:<br>• Now overzealous spell checkers won&#39;t try and correct non-user editable content<br>• Prevented category switching when a keypad is active<br>• Added a much scarier category deletion warning message<br>• And more!",
    "comments":[
      "I've been using YNAB for a couple years now and it's taken my control of finances to a new level. For years I was using a spreadsheet focused on ensuring I had enough cash in the bank to pay bills. It resulted in me spending most of my paycheck paying for things I bought last month on a credit card. It took a couple years, but using YNAB, I was able to get this under control and am now setting aside my current paycheck to pay for next months bills as well as building an emergency fund.",
      "Very useful and have been using it for about 10 months. Though I was (or so I thought) good with my money, this app brought it to another level. I would however like to see some better metrics and data on categories and places spent. I'm not sure if it's available on the web version, but it would be nice to get more of the web features over to the app",
      "I fought my wife's drive to embrace this software/app and their method... I'm just gonna be honest, it's amazing. This time last year I had saved up a couple hundred bucks of my 'allowance' and I was pretty proud. I wasn't using YNAB or anything to manage my spending monies. After spending everything on a trip last year and wanting to plan ahead to go again, I started using YNAB and I've not only saved for the trip, I have savings above the measly couple hundred bucks + money for whatever.",
      "The only budgeting software that I regularly look at and use. Nothing else has worked for me. The app is fun, and the development team and staff are genuinely invested in the success of their customers. I have saved more money with the help of YNAB than I ever have been before. I still overspend, but at least YNAB actually makes me feel bad about it, while being incredibly feature-rich, pleasing to the eye, and - dare I say it - fun to use! I'm a dedicated fan now.",
      "Love, love, love this app! An accountant friend turned me on to it and while it was a shift in thinking and took a bit to get used to I wouldn't do it any other way. Finally able to save money this year. I watched a great youtube tutorial that made it all make sense. Kinda just think of it as envelopes for your $ but in app form. Also, the dev team is super responsive to issues, great product, great company."

Upon filing my taxes I made an honest mistake. Credit Karma immediately sent me an email letting me know that it was rejected by the IRS and the reason why. I was able to fix it right away and resent my taxes. Then I was notified by email from Credit Karma that my tax filing was accepted by the IRS. I'm totally pleased!",
      "Really helpful, tells you what cards you're more likely to get approved for when trying to build your credit so you don't get hit with lowering your credit for not getting approved. Tells you pretty easy step by step on how to build your credit the fastest. Really good at keeping you informed on what's going on with your credit. Give you day by day notifications on new loans and cards you can qualify.",
      "I love how straight forward all the information is and how easy it is to use the app to monitor my credit score. I also love the additional features like the debt tracking (credit card, personal, auto, and car loans) and the suggested actions to improve my scores. And the best part: it's all for free!",
      "Credit Karma is an AWESOME tool to help you get your credit back on track, or even to get great advice on loan or credit cards that would be a good taylored fit especially for you. And you can count on them giving great advice, as well as being able to get your FREE credit score without jumping through hoops first. I'm so very thankful for their advice; never leading me down a wrong path or giving bad advice. They give you CHOICES for things that fit you best. Then it's up to you."

      "I use Acorns as my main checking account. Infinitely better than the bank I had before (Chase). I like that it immediately subtracts spent funds from your account so you don't end up in the negative when a transaction takes a while to go through. You can choose how aggressive you want your investment portfolio to be and how much you want your round ups to be. Anytime I've had to call them, they answer almost immediately and support is knowledgeable and helpful. I definitely recommend them.",

I really need help please some contact me .",
      "I like the whole idea of being in control of my retirement account at a young age and getting started learning how to make good decisions with my money 💵 👍 However the checking account has not been so easy to use. It's almost impossible to successfully change a funding source or to transfer any funds into the checking account. I've sent them numerous pictures of statements and even my debit cards but they refuse to accept them.",
      "This app has terrible customer service and doesnt bother helping or emailing back! ive been trying for months and it takes forever for my debit cards to be verified. They also take 1$ subscription every month without letting you know! I want to uninstall this app but I cant do that with my money still in the account which they won't let me! Its a scam.THE PHONE NUMBER DOESN'T WORK. Update: This app is still terrible. I still haven't gotten my money. Thank you for taking my money.",
      "excellent app. Love the time & energy spent on providing u with the education & advice u need 2 make what would be the right portfolio for yourself. Also, I like the found money aspect of it. Really enjoy the learning experiences that are actually taught in ways easy to understand, which, in turn, makes it easy to make the right moves & decisions. Making the right move & decisions are what is going 2 b the main thing involved in being able 2 make profit & have a great retirement ready for you."

I enjoy roll over budgets and detail each spend, it's helped me so much to arrest over spending as I put everything in instantly.",
      "Easy to use and gets the job done. Which is good. However i don't like the idea of everything that happened in 2019 and before to become irrelevant because of their yearly/monthly filters. Would be nice if we can view \"last 6 months\" or last year. To include data from previous months. Also we can only filter one category at a time, which seems an easy fix. Would be nice if we can filter 2 or more categories for a comparison. Etc",
      "Awesome so far. I'm finally getting all my finances in order. While it's amazing what you spend If you keep track it. So far very few ads and the app is running perfectly not a single hitch.

      "Awesome app. Definitely helps that stupid loophole of \" to have good credit, you have to have credit already in order to build credit\". This app and many others alike help young people like me get started on building credit out of nothing. Very happy with it. The credit card though, is there anyway to increase the credit without paying off the balance just yet? The whole point is keep paying over the year or two to build said credit, but a higher credit limit would be nice.",
      "My score has gone up 90 points in the last 3-4 months with this. I love how simple it is and I've told so many people about it. I recommend this if you're looking for a low-cost payment to increase your credit. It's not so much about how much you pay, it's the history of on time payments that help. I chose to pay the lowest amount for 2 years, by the end I'll have 2 years of on time payments.",
      "This is the most amazing app ever for anyone who needs to build/rebuild their credit. I had filled ch. 7 bankruptcy and been discharged about a year ago now. Needless to say, my credit was looking rough. Now, after 2 months of payments, credit is up 136 points! I don't know how it works, but it works and that's all I care about. Amazing service being provided here with equal opportunities for all.",
      "Since I was already working on my credit prior to getting the CD (Dec 19) and CC (Feb 20) thru them, I can't say for sure which did what or anything at all but my credit has gone up at the minimum 50 points already! But the app is very useful and user friendly. Has an answer for pretty much everything I had a question regarding. I have the $150 12 month loan!",
      "My credit went up a couple points after opening account. The thing that i do not like is the daily withdrawls that come out if my account. It is only pennies daily but after a year this will add up. I am sure it is some kind of interest or fees. I will finish off the term of the loan and will most likely be done with it but anything can happen. I have only had this account for two months. So a little early to tell"

      "Very disappointed in this app. And Turbo Tax in general. I have used this service for the last 5 years, but this year just seems to be nothing but problems. It's been 5 weeks and I'm still waiting for my state refund. I can't seem to even find anywhere to speak to soneone about it Very very frustrating.",
      "I have been using turbo tax for about 4 years now. I love the easy steps and I especially love that I get consistent credit score updates. I am a huge fan that it shows me all the debt I have and organized methods for me to pay them off. Thank you for such an awesome app!!",
      "I really like this app. Having this has helped me get my credit score up steadily and I'm saving better for a house. If you're looking to improve your financial situation then downloading this will be like having a personal financial coach pointing you in the right direction.",
      "Turbo has organized my credit info for me very well. It answers the vital questions you may have about your credit score without you even asking, and always gives me timely updates! My credit score is up 33 pts in 1 month, and I know that thanks to Turbo!!",
      "I have been using Turbo tax for several years now and it hasnt let me down. Im smart enough to do my own taxes but this app makes it easier and helps with any unexpected sircumstances. It makes it easier to post my taxes also. Through out the year it gives me updates and notificarions on all kinds of helpful tax and credit ideas."

I use this app among all day for all my expenses, for example: after shopping. The new selector is hard to use for me, too slowly. Now I have to touch the funnel icon to type everytime when I add a new transaction. Please let us to set default payee input method in the settings. I prefer old style input with autofocus.",
      "I've been using the app for years. But the new Payee selector is a pain. I thought I had the process down to just hit the filter button first then type the payee. That works for Payees you already have but if you try to type in a new Payee in that box it just comes up as blank unless you add the payee with the plus button. It would be great if it had the option to go back to the old payee box.",
      "I have been using this app for more than 3 yrs now. I am a licensed CPA and finance professional and I can say that of all the dozens of tracking apps out there, this is the cleanest, simplest, most accurate and tiny in size money managing app I have ever used. I employ it for both personal and business and when I file my own taxes each year it is the easiest thing in the world pulling reports and various filters to get the info I need. Highly recommended & reasonably priced!"

      "My first transaction from Postmates was completely lost and the company gives you the run around by asking you for a trace number that you can't provide. It happened the second time today and I had the check stub along with the deposit date and they did it again. During these challenging times it is obvious what they're doing. They are taking hard working Americans money and buying up the stock market. Money is the root of all evil and this company is just that evil",
      "Overall, I love this bank and app. The way in which they cover expenses and goals makes it really easy to understand where my money is, what bills are covered, and where various goals are. using all of the advantages the app provides has really helped my family improve our financial standing. They add features in that are really helpful in planning out finances and I'm excited about future offerings like rules, CDs, etc. So why not 5 stars? Tech support. By and large their support team is great, but when you come across a big problem (like I have) there does not seem to be any way to escalate to Tier 2 or 3 support, you always stay at the same level. If they get that fixed, it is 5 stars all the way.",
      "I've been banking with Simple for 6 years now, and I have ZERO complaints. Their support is always helpful and friendly. I enjoy the fee-FREE banking and easy access and control to my debit card and account. They also have industry-leading savings options and more. LOVE Simple! I recommend it to anyone!",
      "Awesome. App has helped me to save better than ever before. Tracks spending, budget for expenses, and little to no fees. In the short time I've been using this I've probably tripled the money I have in my account by better budgeting",
      "I've used Simple for several years and have had no issues. I can use it in stores and on-line. It connects to Google Pay. Adding money to the account has always been easy. And I really like that you can set up your expenses so you always know what money is safe to spend."

      "Great app! Quapital helps me save unconsciously by letting me set the terms on when to save and how much when I am paid. Without having it done in a way that I don't notice it, I wouldn't typically save very much or anything at all. The support team is also very helpful and quick to respond and resolve any issue or questions. Highly recommend!",
      "Great way to save, I've used for like 7 months and i love how it help in saving money. Then I decided to take break and later on I downloaded the app again I tried to link my bank account again and it kept telling me error. I was so disappointed.",
      "They say they won't charge after you've reached under $100 in your bank account. But they've continuously did it to me. And refuse to take responsibility for it. Maybe they need to upgrade whatever system they're using to check balance before transferring money because of the rules you have in place.",
      "This app has made saving possible for me! I don't even notice the money coming out and it stops if my funds are low. I greatly recommend this!",
      "NO human customer support, STUCK with NO money! - $5648 I CAN'T GET to becuase I'm getting a \"error contact customer support.\" - Send you to an AI messaging support app that is garbage at understanding what you need. - Can't add a different bank because I'm getting a connection error. -Any app dealing with your money should have 24/7 call support. - Charge you a fee for nothing at all. No free option any longer. Thanks for the extremely stressful 4 days, Qapital!"

      "A little tricky to get things set up properly. Needs work to streamline things. \"Lightning speed\" doesn't work with all banks (example: my bank placed a 3 day \"check hold\" on transactions through debit). Once setup is done though, it works really well. Pretty accurate daily logging and cash outs happen exactly when promised. Hands down, it's worlds better than taking out payday loans. If you're in a cycle of payday loan debt, do yourself a favor and try this app. (not a sponsored post).",
      "3/19/2020 - Just wanted to give an update. This app was working great....for a while. But earlier this month it just stopped working. Now I dont know whether it is on their end or something with my bank, but I find certain things funny and annoying. They keep raising my max - yet I cant even withdraw. They cant access my bank info -- but they will gladly take money out even without knowing my balance. This needs to be fixed soon because it is very frustrating. They will cause me to overdraw.",
      "Complete garbage! Used to work well, saved me a few times. I started having bank update/screenshot issues every single time I tried to use the app. Asked for help, at first someone could manually accept my screenshot, fixed my problem quickly, after this happened a few times, they decided to delete my banking info \"to fix the problem on their end\" asked me to redo my banking account info through the app. I have tried 100s of times have cont. to reach out for help and still won't work. Trash app.",
      "It started off great! Then every pay period started experiencing Bank connectivity issue. I spoke to a number of reps about the situation and They keep giving me the same info about the app. I tried restarting it. Tried putting Bank info again. Nothing would allow me to connect. Im 5 days into the NEW pay period. Was able to Cash out once. Still havent gotten back to me about the problem. This app is great at time. But sucks alot more.",
      "This app has helped me more than a few times. Recently it's getting harder to want to use it anymore. I don't mind the tip because it does help, but here recently it's taking longer for the funds to hit, and it is 10:37 Mar 10th and the app still thinks it's Mar 9th. Would just consider it a minor inconvenience but it's all the time now."

      "I loved it so much I bought the Premium version, which says a lot as I never pay for apps! I love the ability to customise categories, the pretty layout. One cool thing is that within a category, you can create subcategories, e.g.\"flights\", \"accomodation\" in \"travel\" - that way, you don't have to type it every time, and you can also see how much is spent on what. There are lots of features that I'm not using, like being able to save your monthly records and print them. 100% 👍!",
      "Nice application with attractive design, simple input and a great widget. However, there are 4 issues. (1) It lacks recurrence end date (2) the transaction has no time (hours & minutes), specially when it is required to sort transactions according to time during the same day (3) it will be great if each transaction shows the total balance along with each input for each account (not from starting & projected balance). (4) refund is reflected in the account not in categories amount or in overview.",
      "Overall, I'm satisfied with the app, although I would like the developers to add a feature with which we can have a description added to the expense, for example the list of groceries, the destination, etc. We are able to add the descriptions, but they are not saved when the app is closed. For the time being I'm giving it four stars because of its functionality. I will give it five stars once the feature has been added. Keep up the good work!",
      "Really really love this cool app! It covers all of my need in terms of tracking expense and salary. Obviously willing to subscribe. Easy to use, cool interface, and the experience fulfill my expectation. Cannot wait to use all of the functions. Great job team, keep going!",
      "Love the flexibility of this app (particularly with the lifetime upgrade which was really inexpensive and totally worth it). I REALLY wish it had a web version so I could pull it up on my computer when I really need to dig into things. My favorite part might be the ability to customize the colors and pictures. It makes budgeting and tracking more enjoyable!"

      "Great app, but my reporting period is 25th to 25th, so month by month doesn't help me. I need to report, especially budget wise, from the 25th to the 25th. I'm sure a lot of users might have similar \"non standard\" reporting periods. Can you guys maybe look at incorporating this as far as budgets are concerned? For example, the majority of my expenses for February will take place from the 26th to the 31st January, but they're allocated to January which skews the reporting.",
      "Bought the lifetime membership and been using it for about 4 years. Their backend service is great as I encountered some hiccups when I switch my phone cos I backup the data with the older version. They are very helpful to send me the file of the previous version in order for me to retrieve my backup data and update the data to the latest version without me losing any of my past data. Keep up the great work! Thanks.",
      "The devs are absent. Been waiting a couple of months for an email I've sent and no answer whatsoever, communication is something I find essential especially for an app that you pay a subscription (or buy the lifetime version since it has the option). The app is good, not great, and definitely not bad, but there are some things that they should work on. And if there is no communication from them it's safe to assume they just moved on and they will no longer respond or will make any mayor updates",
      "The best budget app ever in the app store 👌👍. I found a bit unprofessionalism from the developer. They simply disregard of your expectation from the app. I had the request of adding option of choosing any photo from gallery to be set as custom icon. They simply reject to be satisfied with the built in icons. Another request was to make any account to be excluded from total (there surely has the option but not working actually) so that I might use my office account in parallel but in vain.",
      "The app is beautiful but only in English. With arabic usage, I can't be able to add data as a new entry or new expense. I hope to develop the application in Arabic like the other languages that work in the application correctly."

      "This app is high quality and functions at a professional level. It is the best I have found for quotes, charts, news and broad market overview. I use their app on my android phones and tablets and I use their website counterpart on my desktop computers. So far, all functions are free. The only criticism I have is that I would like to discover if I can pay them for services such as using it as an actual trading platform/broker but this company seems to be too busy to answer my inquiries.",
      "Use this app everyday. Useful for timely news keeping track of my watchlist, and the economy. News for individual stocks could be better, but still a great app. EDIT: The news portion of the app is one of my favourite things. The notifications are so timely and useful. Thank you!!",
      "Very good and useful app. The charts, news and performance overviews are very handy to use. It also includes a multichart function. So a whole portfolio can be charted in once with the help of small charts. I feel better informed with this app.",
      "Latency is a big problem for this app. It has lots of great functions but if you wanna use it for actual trading remember it's always about 1-2 minutes behind. I think your developers need really to work on this issue.",
      "For the most part a good app. Points are off by 1 or 2 but better than most. The constant reminder of something going up or down is annoying. But I think I can change that in settings. Besides that better than most."

      "I love the fact that this app gives you the details though the one thing this app lacks is time ... I would of given 5 stars if it didnt seem to lag a day behind so i miss out to some standpoint but i also know what stocks to look at 4 out of 5 stars legit",
      "This is a very awesome app. Especially if you're mildly a beginner. The first two times I used it it helped me with a lot of info. I end up doubling my money... awesome thanks...",

      "Great card to have if you have established some credit and are trying to build it up more. I like that they give you the first year with no interest so you can buy what you need and have time to pay it off get your credit score to go higher and then be more careful in year two with your spending and paying it off because you'll have interest rates at that time.",
      "It's been a great app, but recently the rewards, credit journey, even feedback pages do not load. The screen remains white. I tried clearing cache, deleting data, but it didn't work. I then tried deleting and reinstalling the app, it worked once, but now it is back to a blank white screen. Please fix your app! And please don't tell me to send a secure message by logging into the site. This is an app problem, period.",
      "Use to love this app, but for the past few months it won't let me log in. It either says \"unable to connect to chase at the moment\" or \"we do not recognize that username or password\". I've uninstalled and reinstalled, still no luck. If I go online on my laptop or desktop, I can log on, but the app won't work. I see lots of other reviews with the same issue. If Chase fixes the issue, I will change my raiting.",
      "This app has been useful until March of 2020 when the Make A Payment page stopped working. Clicking on anything on that page is futile. No keyboard opens up to type in an amount. Payments cannot be made. This app has no purpose if one still must open your website,for a transaction. How do I should give this app negative 5 stars?"

      "Until a recent update in March, which happened right around the market crash, the app was working great. Now, I can not set any of my feed settings. I have set all of the parameters to show nothing, yet nothing changes. I have certain markets I was watching but decided I didn't want to see them every day, and I can't get rid of them now. Very frustrating. It WAS a great app. Now it take more of my time than I prefer.",
      "Very limited in setting up push alerts. As someone who has had their account compromised before, would like to be able to set up push alerts so that any money both in and out of my accounts are pushed to my phone as soon as it is seen. Especially accounts with physical debit cards. As far as I can tell, I can only set up those alerts as email alerts in the web portal, and push alerts are limited to trading...",
      "There are no 'Push Notifications' for Fidelity credit card or debit card or Cash Management transactions. There are no 'Push Notification' settings for these accounts. There used to be, but they are gone. The only notification setting is for trades. This problem has persisted since Version update 3.40. Recent update to 3.46 did not fix. Telephone calls and emails have not resulted in a fix.",
      "My phone just upgraded to Android 10. Once it's upgraded, this app cannot start any more. I uninstalled and reinstalled again. It worked for once in the beginning, and then when launch next time it stopped on the first screen. And freeze there. It seems cannot start anymore. It worked perfectly fine with Android 9 but not after upgrade. I am a heavy user of the app, and need it fixed asap. Thanks.",
      "Great app. I liked it better with the news and market stuff on the front page above account summary. Lot more colorful and interesting. Would be great if it showed daily info for 401k shares too. They seem to have pre loaded pages it fetches based on how good or bad the market is doing, and it seems to change throughout the week for reasons unknown. It can be a pain in the ass and frustrating because it's always changing where I have to look for the info im looking for."

The way everything is worded for you, as well as the examples given, really help you to fully grasp & catch on to what they're saying the first time.

      "Terrible app and online login. I can almost never login to check my balance. Will not use the service again. I want to payoff with the 3 month option they offer but it's always extremely difficult to check balance. Maybe this is a strategy they use to keep ppl on the lease long term so they get double the money. Anyway needs a major upgrade.",
      "The app is amazing and easy to use but I had major issues with the company towards the end where they take money out of my account and then refund the money a couple days later. I got emails telling me my lease was paid in full and then almost a month later saying it actually wasn't. I will never use progressive again.",
      "Not only is the app great but the company itself is absolutely wonderful!! In the time I have been doing business with progressive leasing I have had to call customer service three times to be exact. And all three times I received the absolute best customer service! My third call was today and not only did the gentlemen take care of my request but went even further and was able to help me out even more with my situation! Keep it up! Unfortunately great service like that is very rare !",

      "This app is terrible. Their security is awful. Their response on trouble tickets is even worse. It also leaves you hanging to where you don't know if they even got your message. They can't do anything right. A couple months after I listed the comments above I tried to request funds from somebody and instead venmo sent them funds putting my account in the negative. I can not warn you enough, so not use this app it's terrible.",
      "I like the ease and convenience of using the Venmo app and the Venmo card. I do have a few improvement suggestions: 1) It would be nice to get a notification in the app confirming others received $, similar to when one uses it as a Mastercard (other than the recipient responding if they feel like it.) 2) There needs to be a better was to recall money accidently sent to the wrong person. 3) It takes too many days to transfer money to and from bank accounts.",
      "Needs to have: 1. More than one person should be able to use the same bank account, like a husband and wife with a shared account. 2 An option to verify the identify of the recepient - like sending a real-time ping or something. Last 4 digits of the phone number are okay, but wouldn't a real time ping verification be easier, especially for retail transactions?",
      "This has been a lifesaver more than once, it's particularly a great app if you needed money in your bank account right now it's great!. That was then, this is now.it keeps telling me that my debit card can't be used for instant transfers. it worked fine with Wells Fargo but when I switch to chase now it's giving me misery up the ass.",
      "This is the most useless app I have on my phone. When I first used it, it worked fine, but after the 3rd time of using it, it no longer would transfer my funds. Called card company, no problem there. Called venmo. they say I have to try again later or its a security reason. they cannot tell me what would cause the problem or can not lift the security restriction. STILL AFTER THIS, wanted to give it benifit, so ordered card. Now there's a \"bug\" in the system and cannot activated. Waited a month."

      "Really like this app. It obviously takes more effort than automatic apps linked to your bank account. On the other hand, it's the most secure method second to using excel/physical paper. I have my phone set that if I double tap and swipe it opens toned a new transaction there and then, so I can take a picture of a receipt and enter the transaction as soon as it happens. Could use an interest festure for investment accounts and category icons should be coloured differently",
      "Amazing app with excellent customizability. Normally can't get used to budget apps because I keep feeling like I can't enter transactions like I want to, however, that is absolutely not the case here. I haven't tried the pro version, but I don't feel like it's necessary either because you are given basically everything in the free version already."

      "Never use and/or quit now! Do not trust them with any amount of money. Empower without any notice or explanation froze my account multiple times. At first their only explanation has been that it was accidental. The latest freeze they simply say was a breach of their Terms of Service, without any explanation. Their customer support seems to be outsourced, has no real knowledge of anything, incompetent, and no ability to fix anything. My account was frozen for 4+ months, still with no resolve 👎👎",
      "This started out as a great, high interest bank with attentive customer service that was fast and easy to use. All that has changed. Their interest rates have greatly decreased, their customer service has been outsourced and is not longer available via live chat and there's no number to call. To get a replacement card or dispute transactions is basically impossible.",
      "My husband downloaded this app, set everything up and then he wasnt able to login at all. For a couple of months now random amount charges have came out of his other bank account to this company every other day. One day its 10 next its 40. He has attempted to call and get this matter fixed and there is no one available to speak. This app is stealing money from our family of 6.",
      "It's getting a star as in 1. Why not 5 stars, I've only begun to delve into this app and honestly they're brand new as in they've just been able to get this on the play store they're still working out kinks in the loan portion so I'll actually look at this properly and use it then rewrite this whole thing, good luck Empower I mean that",
      "I LOVE this app! It is so convenient to use and see what I am spending where and what I have left! Also they have many great tools to help you save! I have direct deposit and absolutely love this bank!"

Also, reviews of Betterment that complain about lower than promised savings rates are bogus. Betterment is just as competitive as everyone else online.",
      "I have put money into several different accounts and I liked this idea, but the only thing I don't like is that you can not change the amount of deposits like you can in Acorn. I will keep using, but will only put money into areas of where I can change the deposit amounts. Thanks for getting back to me and I did figured it out after playing with the app for a few hours. Still using and still putting money into it.",
      "\"clear\" button no longer works to clear the suggested amount on 'some' of my accounts when making deposits. I now have to clear the suggested amount via the pop-up keyboard. Annoying. If I had the suggested amount I'd take a 10 week vacation and still have thousands left to invest. Reinstalled, cleared cache, deleted data, restarted, turned around, put my left foot in, put my left foot out and did all the typical tech support stuff.",

      "Best CC app I've ever used. And I would recommend Capital One/CreditWise to anyone trying to rebuild their credit. Don't fall for others charging annual fees. It will hurt you in the long run when you inevitably cancel the card. Who wants to pay annual fees in perpetuity? That's how the others make their money on the backs of people with bad credit, sometimes thru no fault of their own. GL.",
      "I like this app because it shows all my credit reports and updates every 7 days which I think is very great in my book. Also, it tells me what I can do to improve my credit score even more. I just wish that I can pay all my bills at once and then my credit score will be going up the roof😂😉 Anyway, when I get a more secure job I will pay more amounts but definitely when I pay off Capital One off, I will go back to them! Keep up the good work!",
      "Making payments is simple. It alerts me of any impact to my credit score and who and what is making the impact. This app also gives updates on your credit score, tells you when the next credit score update will take place, and gives you stats on areas that impact your credit good or bad. Informs you of ways to improve in areas that are not execellent. I log in with my fingerprint so I've not been having any log in issues like the others have mentioned in their reviews.",
      "I wish there was 0 star ratings! First of all I cant sighn in for several month already even I have never change or sign up with new user name . That's what actually I see when trying to sign in every single time: \"we're sorry, but it looks like you already have enrolled using another account. Please login with that username.W-190-3936 .read above I have never change or enroll with any other accounts!Support is Terrible! I Report this issue Logn time ago. Nothing changed! Have to report to BBB",
      "Love this app it lets me know immediately if something on my credit was ran or used it also helps me keep track of my credit scorealso helps tell you what to do to improve your credit score within the last month and my credit score went up 71 points I was amazed! This app is the best with capital one"

This app is horrible and needs a lot of work...it may be better on computer but for a phone app it is ridiculous like for example the price/share is very inaccurate and takes forever to update, my limit orders NEVER get filled (had to use a market order in order to trade), and TD ameritrade offers 24/5 trading but I havent been able to trade in pre-marker...got no problem paying for trades as long as the app work",

If you run into issues, just uninstall and reinstall it but remember to save your WL to the servers. One major issue is when I place an order, it takes 5-30 seconds for the order to show up in the position tab so I can't update it in a fast moving market. I had to switch to thinkorswim app to update my order as it's faster. Already sent this bug"

      "I've been using Schwab for 5 years now and have recommended it to many people. But lately, I'm getting frustrated with how inconvenient the mobile app for day traders. The account doesn't reflect what's been purchased today until after the market closes, no way to check the updated average, or new stocks etc. Because of how volatile the market is, I want to take advantage of it, but Schwab is holding me back. I'm looking at other options and going to switch soon.",
      "Good for investing, unwieldy for checking. Seems to be designed for the older generation, which is fine, I don't need bubbles and cartoons, but somehow it doesn't flow like any other bank app would (e.g. find the \"transfer\" button and then pick an account, rather than selecting the account and having an option to transfer).",
      "I deposit check electronically every week for 4 year straight. I have always had a hard time depositing the checks using the app. I have the Google Pixel phone which has a very nice camera. I don't know why it takes me sometimes 30 attempts to deposit the checks and sometimes I have to try for 3 to 4 days over and over again.",
      "Interesting how it auto-logs me out everytime i want to view my positions on a day where the Dow is down 250 points. Edit 3/16. After failing to buy at a low price because the app crashed, this app has once again let me down. The app forcequits every time I attempt to view my positions or buy more stock. Absolute pathetic from such a large company. Don't trust them with your money!!!",
      "While setting up an account I hit the back button to change preferences and it made me start over. It did save the account since the username was no longer available for a new account but when trying to sign in it said access denied. I had no option to finish setting up the account or login so screw it, I downloaded a different app."

      "This is a first-rate app, probably the best news app available. I've been reading (and now listening also) for years. The FT's world coverage is excellent and the design is clear and easy on the eye. The only thing is the old logo that still sits at the top of the Android version! Needs updating. Otherwise, hard to fault.",
      "Six months later, still sends notifications even when disabled in the app, must be disabled in system settings. Content is great, subscription costly. Too bad they can't afford to pay developers enough to make an app that doesn't randomly embarrass me in important meetings with notifications. I've confirmed this problem on two different devices now as of 2019-11-15. Also still has ads after you're logged in with your subscription. And you cant click on the widget title to open the app",
      "Financial Times (FT) is a terrific news app. It's the best news app Ive ever used. Kudos! FT is one of the best news organizations in the world. Reading FT in the app is sublime. The app has dark mode support, but I prefer the default sepia background which is easy on the eyes. Navigation within the app is intuitive. The app has many customization settings. Personalizing news content via \"MyFT\" provides a curated, personal news section the user can finetune granularly or broadly.",
      "Very nice app. I give 5 stars but I still would like to see less background refresh like other news apps and the possibility to cancel my subscription directly on the app.",
      "This app is so disappointing. Every time I am using Chrome or Twitter and click on a FT link, it sends me to a sign in page instead of redirecting to the app (where I am obviously logged in)."

      "Works well. Able to quickly look up Stock Ratings.",
      "This application has a lot of varying \"bugs\". The most recent being the inability to delete stocks from watch lists. It has a delete button that doesn't work.",
      "I love IBD been using it for 20 years since It was a newspaper now to see how far it's come to be able to use it on my phone and interact is amazing It's very easy to use and user friendly"
