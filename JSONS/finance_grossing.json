      "I used Turbo tax for the very first time i done my taxes by myself. It was a little harder that i expected but i got it done. Having to wait now because i didnt print them off right away ( i used my cellphone to file instead of computer) , it said it needed some kind of attached voucher when i printed it off. I ended up calling DOR and they gave me a number to put in the memo. Still waiting for my return and that means still waiting to purchase diff vehicle.... :((",
      "The app cost $150 for what I can get everywhere else for less than $20. Plus the app has become cumbersome and deceptive, with adds after every section. I used TurboTax for years but no more. The response I got was a form response and doesn't remove any fees. In fact it only highlighted their deceptive fee practices. I want to be clear that the service I required that took my bill to $150 was the form for my student loan repayment. I used another service and it was free.",
      "I would gladly recommend TurboTax, but not the app. This year I used the app instead of filing on a computer like I normally do. I was not happy with the app. It made the experience much more stressful by randomly saving and forcing you to go back to the beginning of a section and only to click through everything all over again and to add insult to injury, it repeatedly throws an upgrade for some Max service each time it makes you restart. I'll keep using TurboTax, but just not the app.",
      "The real free version is hidden! If you make less then like 60k, you qualify for a truly free version. The app will ask you pay (and not show the IRS free file option) if you have one of the many pretty common tax situations. The IRS free file version through tubo tax is through there web interface ONLY and it's far inferior to the app. You can, however, start on the app and when it tells you to pay, you can convert using the web version and continue with the info you already entered.",
      "This is my 4th year using TurboTax and I have no complaints so far! Its Simple, they help you along the way. They double, triple check at times and they are reasonable on prices for filing electronically. This to me is the cherry on top, or strawberry whatever your preference!!! Its much better than those liberty, H&R etc. Places. The convenience alone is worth it. I don't have to travel to file or receive my money. A+"

      "Great app when it works. But it has bugs. When something goes wrong they have no idea hiw to fix it. I actually had customer service tell me to turn detection off. SERIOUSLY. The canned response to this review was not helpful. I emailed three times, called and nothing. Again, great app when it works. But when it doesn't you can't get much help.",
      "App works well, unfortunately it's not terribly accurate for me. It doesn't offer any controls for when to trigger automated tracking. This means if I'm a passenger in another car, it's creating logs that have to be edited or deleted. I wish they would add the ability to trigger automated tracking when the device connects to Bluetooth. This would give me the ability to more accurately track miles when I'm actually driving my vehicle.",
      "Does not allow you toggle off auto drive detection without constantly giving a notification and attempting to \"open a chat\" if you. The reason this is annoying is the app will constantly try and update your location causing other apps to fail even when you aren't moving. It's also useless for uber since it mixes half your rides together into blobs of random drives. This app needs some work. If you dont drive much this app will work for you fine. Kinda defeats the point though right?",
      "Used to be great, but the past several months, it has trouble detecting my drives so I miss a lot. A competitors app does not have that problem. I reinstalled and followed instructions on fixing this but it doesn't work. Until this is fixed, I won't be subscribing anymore.",
      "This mileage tracker is perfect for small businesses that have travel expenses. I have had this for over 2 years and absolutely swear by it. Sometimes I have to add drives but very rarely. Usually it's because my phone was rebooting or an update shut off my settings. Not often enough to be a bother. I highly recommend for business with travel."

      "I have been using QuickBooks for a year now, it is ok , you can follow your expenses and have all organised when the app is working properly. In my case, recently the transaction function does not record all data from my bank for the last month , is the second time this happens. Also they make it so difficult to get human help , I have to spend half an hour goin through the AI questions to get the help I need. Not really reliable when you have to check expenses continuously.",
      "If you get a new phone you start from ZERO . Unlike other receipt keepers. That's super problematic and makes this make all effectively useless. Glad I changed phones earlier in the year rather than later when I may have had months of receipts to try to categorize. Pass on this app until it figures out a way to be able to transfer business rules, receipt saving and etc across multiple phones for a single email/account",
      "Today my phone (android) has installed the latest update as promissed. Problem is... it has changed all my \"milleage\" tab km to miles on my phone. ALL my logged km have automagically converted to miles eventhough it still shows in km. I cannot even, with some certainty, tell if the conversion is even accurately due to not having a back up log. What's going on with you guys?",
      "I would not suggest this paid app. If I could get my money back I would. The software kept increasing my expected tax payments every time I modified transactions to the point that my expected payment was 3 times my actual income. Pretty poor functionality for the most fundamental of purposes for this app.",
      "Update 3/10/2020 Wish I could get a refund. Customer service is non existent. The assistance they claim to provide me is the same as my last complaint. App is currently not accepting mileage updates when I select personal or business. App still shows wrong bank account information. They still deposit funds into the wrong account and have zero ways of changing the default account, or at least they've not provided me a means to change accounts. They also like to bombard you with TurboTax spam."

      "Not good on my Samsung Galaxy Tablet. The app seems really useful and helpful. I was able to install on my tablet, open an account easily, and plug in the preliminary budget numbers no problem. I was really enjoying it until I closed and reopend the app (on my tablet) and now I cannot get it to open. I sign in and it goes right back to the sign in page. Frustrating.",
      "It's a good app. A little hard to navigate and could benefit from some kind of AI to walk you through the initial set up and maybe stick with you a few months to get you completely lined out. Then maybe greet you again periodically to let you know about updates and give you some tips. Also the plus version is too expensive in my opinion just to link bank accounts and drag and drop feature mostly. Anyway it's what I am using at the moment to supplement my pen and paper budget.",
      "Waste of money. It worked seamlessly for the first month and now it does not sync with my bank unless i sign out, uninstall the app, sign back in, and put in a new security code every time. And now this week, even that doesnt work. The app freezes and stops working. Ive emailed the Ramsey solutions people and they flat out refuse to refund me my money. Update: Still a waste of money! Now my transactions sync again but 3x per one! So I get to manually delete 2/3 of the transactions! Yay me!",
      "Absolutely LOVE Every dollar! I feel so much more in control of my budget. I can easily see where I was spending more money in certain categories than I was aware. I recommend this to everyone of my family and friends whenever the subject of money comes up.",
      "I've been using this off and on to track my budget which helped, but I've never really followed it and didn't enjoy manually entering expenses. I recently upgraded to the plus version which links your bank account. This has been magical! I'm now staying on budget and can look at what is remaining in each category wherever I am. Thankful for this app since it has kept me on track for paying off debt!"

      "It's OK except that every single time you log in online it shows a page where you can sign up to become a paying member and how great a service it would be to be fully protected from scammers and such. The service they offer is minimal and it sends an email when it detects a change in your credit. The FICO score and Credit Report are free so it's not that bad. The app just takes up extra space on your phone and that page (very annoying) still shows up. They should include it in the menu.",
      "I did what this app told me to do. It says I don't have enough credit history and i look risky to lenders. You need 5 credit card types .then it picked out what was best matched for me with my score and how i spend already etc ,etc.. I was denied on the first 2 and my score just dropped 18 points immediately. I didn't even bother trying anymore. I didnt even want too in the first place but was told this would help me out. Yeah right.",
      "I keep having sign in problems. I have had to change my password 3 times. I changed it last night. Got in fine a minute ago, when to log back in after closing out and it's not accepting the SAME password. I have even tried all my other passwords just in case and retyped the known password 3 times. I'm getting very frustrated with this app. I didn't pay 20 bucks a month for a service I can't use.",
      "Since last app update, cannot log in, at all. Password text box won't even accept the cursor. Update 3/17/20: you did it, again! Broke the app. Nothing on the login screen is clickable. Un/reinstalling the app does NOT fix it. 😡 Yes, I already emailed you at the address, below. Still awaiting a reply... Oh, good! Glad to hear you are working on a solution.",
      "How long is the website/App going to keep having \"technical\" issues? For the past 3 weeks I have been trying to verify bills on my account to boost my credit score, but every time I do it; all I get is  \"Uh oh…We had an issue connecting. The team is looking into it. Please try again later\" I may have to uninstall from my phone if it continues like this"

      "After trial: I didn't like that I was forced to use the trial after declining the initial offer. I wanted to look through the app and properly set it up beforehand. Once the trial ran out the milage tracker just about last all functionality. Turned on tracking and went for a trip but it stopped tracking once I stopped. It's like it's programmed to be inconvenient in order to \"encourage\" users to pay for the subscription. I think it's a fairly good app, *if* you have a subscription. Otherwise no.",
      "I bought an annual subscription thinking this app was going to be so helpful in tracking my business mileage and expenses. Big mistake! I have experienced so many bugs and issues with the mileage tracking (having a trip broken into 20 small segments of the trip), not recording all of my trips and having to manually go back and find which trips recorded and which did not. I spend more time double checking Hurdlr records than it would take to manually track the info!",
      "I manage a handful of entrepreneurial endeavors, using slightly fewer bank accounts than I might like. The ability to automatically import, set rules for, and quickly adjust transactions has made reconciliations many times easier. That the mobile app has most of the functionality of the web one, and let's you log time as well as mileage, is an excellent boon. That said, there are times where the categorizations are frustratingly limited or inaccurate , and there's no time tracking widget.",
      "I LOVE this app. The automatic mileage tracker ensures i never miss a deduction and i love the integration of my income and expenses as well. The app is so smart and has figured out that some places I have expenses are always for a certain business so I don't even have to designate them anymore! A must-have for any small business owner or independent contractor, especially if you travel a lot.",
      "I like the features. It can be linked to a checking account then gives prompts whenever a transaction occurs to lable and categorize it. Remembers recurring expenses. Can be set up to categorize multiple businesses to separate income and expenses for each. I haven't used the mileage tracker as efficiently as it probably could be used. The expense and income tracking and year end reports make it worth it for me."

      "2 major flaws... I would never pay $55 to unlock features to an app, much less one that wont even let us view ALL records within an account. All there is is 30 days, weekly, monthly, yearly and that's it. I mean.. no ALL option?!?! Really?!?! That's as simple as they come UPDATE* I emailed them and they responded with \"we are a non technical support team\" regardless if I could find a calendar view.. previous dates is not what I'm looking for... I want to see all data in an account.",
      "In the beginning I was amazed by the functions and graphics and planned to pay unlimited license, but trial changed my mind. The main issue is that sync with bank account happens only manually and takes several minutes :O next, the payments are not categorised well. I can't believe that even payments from global chains or popular shops are not recognized. For example Rohlik.cz always falls in Electronics. After all I need to make a lot of manual corrections and it makes tracking unpleasant. Update: The machine learning, never learns. I would prefer if you apply simple list of shops and categories to fancy machine learning if you don't know how to make it work.+ Banks sometimes don't connect for weeks and nobody repairs this until customer notice. I will definitively not continue with this *** another year. Thanks",
      "Decent enough free version, though there are a few problems. The biggest one for me is that the \"balance forecast\" appears to be counting my planned payments as positives instead of negatives - i.e. my landlord is paying me rent instead of the other way around. As a result the numbers are so wrong that it's almost comical. I have to use an excel sheet for this instead. There are a couple of things I wish were added too, like being able to separate expenses per day by category in reports.",
      "This is clearly the result of a competent team which cared about user experience. One annoying thing is that I \"can't delete record in connected account\". I'm tracking a bank account and two credit cards. It calculates all of the expenses from the credit cards twice - once for each purchase on the credit card statement, and then the monthly billing of the bank account as well. There should be a simple way to exclude a transaction from the statistics.",
      "Five unresolved support requests and counting. The latest being that it imports credit card expenses as an income and payments as an expense. I noticed that this is an issue reported on their feedback portal last year already that remains unresolved. On another note, it's almost a week now since 3 of my bank connections stopped working and removed from the list of supported banks within wallet. Not a single response nor acknowledgement from the wallet support team."

      "Unfortunately you can't use this to trade in Canada, but this is the most well-made app I've ever used for anything. It's the best way to view stocks. It literally has everything. Super, smooth, clean and looks really good especially dark mode. You can name and create your own watch lists, swipe between them, and follow everything super fast.",
      "Overall app is great for charts across globe. Haven't had a real-time trading experience yet. I would like to suggest in fundamental data, kindly include current imp ratios like - debt to equity (D/E), Price to Sales (P/S), EV to EBITDA, Cash Flow per share, Free cash flow, Price to cash flow ratio, and imp growth rations. Including above mentioned ratios can really help traders, investors in taking informed decisions. Thanks for great app.",
      "This is a fantastic intermediate level trading platform. From a technical analyst style of trading, both the desktop version and app allow for user friendly drawing of trend channels, fibonacci tracements, and a plethora of chart indicators. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fantastic trading platform. This just about has it all, an online chat community, paper trading, margin trading, short selling, options trading, and news relating specifically to the ticker all organized fantastically",
      "This app is a joke. I signed up almost a month ago, somehow it took 2 weeks to process my first deposit, then it bounced back had to pay a fee and fund even more to cover the fee. After $75 later and my deposits finally cleared I was hoping it was the end of it. When I went to place a trade somehow my account still has restrictions. I've tried to contact customer support but everytime I message I get an auto-reply. Horrible experience so far, YouTubers getting pay to promote looks like",
      "Perfect mobile trading app.....almost. The user interface is very well thought out, and quite frankly puts many desktop platforms to shame. The downside is their level 2 premium subscription doesn't appear to show the true level 2 quotes, most of the time, when compared in real time to competitor level 2 quotes."

      "So far things are working fairly well with app. Although I find it strange that since I am using the app often,I have been receiving calls from robo-messeges stating my ssn is being \"suspended \" due to suspicious activity and to call a specific number. I call the number and usually receive a voice recording telling me that the mailbox is full and to try again later. If this is true at all, wouldn't it be posted in all this glorious information that you provide to me?",
      "I highly recommend this app. It's not only free, but more importantly, a great educational tool to teach you how to use credit wisely as well as improve your own credit score. And now offering even more updated financial advice to help you wisely get through the Covid-19 pandemic. Love all the new features! Bravo Credit Sesame! 😊",
      "One of the most reliable Apps you could find out there. Compared to other apps that provide similar services, I wished Credit Sesame could keep track of score updates on a more timely fashion. Other than that, it is reliable, and provides best tips towards a healthy credit score.",
      "Quickly showed me my credit score, and negative mark against that I didn't know of. Quickly matched me to banks that I had the best odds of being approved for line of credit to start building my score again. It's been fast and painless. Great job!",
      "Credit Sesame is very good it helps you put your credit back into place. I have told all my friends and I hope they start checking their credit scores that is why I gave you a 5 stars you guys are awesome."

This was easily a 4 star app at the beginning of the day, but about 1 PM it just stopped automatically updating the charts I was following. Please fix this ASAP!!",
      "In the most recent update, it seems you guys tried to fix the alignment of % change (y-axis) such that it aligns with the leftmost bar. It is still messed up. The 0% aligns with the top of the solid bar and the bottom of the hollow bar. It should be the other way around. Please fix it asap. It is nuisance.",
      "The look of the app changed and got slower, so I updated it . Still looks the same, very slow , almost unusable. ..I use this for several hours per day .I had no problems for years , now this....I would be happy how it was 6 monts ago...fix it please...we all are saying the same thing...I have an android phone f.y.i... Update 3/20/20 updated today, all better, fast, seems as good as it was a while ago....thanks",
      "It's a battery hog. That needs to be fixed. There should be options for lower battery consumption mode. Not everyone needs stock updates every 100 milliseconds when app is running in the background. I am following up for the third time. When is this issue going to be fixed? Why should an app consume 25% battery in 4 minutes of use with background disabled? You have a lot of teams and hoops and loops... but this is insane. Let these go directly to the concerned person and fire the middleman.",
      "New version is great. It got rid of the clunkiness and slowness of the old one. Thanks very much. One bug I noticed is a mention of three new posts for a ticker, when in fact nothing has been posted for that ticker in the last 24 hours."

      "the info in the paid service are not impressive enough. at least it should show the 52 week low price. or even let the user, choose to show 2 year low, 3 year low price, or whatever time span. these are info the info service provider could easily provide. that would save much effort to the end users",

Update: still not ad free. I want a refund please. Stop this mambo jumbo about technicalities. This is fraud.",
      "Tried to sign up 8 times with email and I never received a confirmation code. Absolutely useless. Just tried again and still won't send confirmation code by email. I did receive an email, but it would take far too long to fill in the information on their support request than it's worth. Absolutely useless with terrible customer support.",
      "Took hours to get the email verification email. The app had a window asking for the verification code in that email. But by then, that window was long gone. No way to enter the code or reset the password or finish the account registration in any way. Do some basic testing before releasing an app. Not worth my time.",
      "Between the full page ads on every load, and the broken premarket and after hours figures that just disappeared recently this is a strong pass. Many other apps out there with more features, less ads and just as fast with market numbers. This is a great example of a decent app, ruined by developer greed. Uninstall",
      "This app kills itself by deploying full screen ads that completely BLOCK the News Article you've clicked onto read. The ad cannot be removed. You must click back to the previous screen to remove the ad. This renders most of the news feed useless. Stupid."

That's not a huge deal, apps change aesthetically and functionally from time to time. The big problem is that all of my accounts show balances that are wildly out sync with reality. One of my accounts had a (correct) balance of a few hundred dollars last night, but now shows over $90,000. Please send help.",

Then the update happened and all 6 of my accounts, some of which had at least a year of date on it are now completely messed up. I have spent time trying to get the accounts correct again but they are so messed up that it would be easier to start over. At first I was just going to delete everything and start over with the app, but after reading the reviews it appears that a lot of users are having issues after the update. Therefore I have decided to uninstall and find something else. It's terrible that such an incredible app is now essentially useless because of an update.",
      "This was the best checkbook app out there. I have used it for years. The update that happened made it unusable. The app crashes everytime I use it and shows all my accounts in the negative by thousands of dollars. I import the dropbox backup and it makes it correct but the next time I open it goes back to the wrong balances. You have to see all your transactions unless you choose to hide cleared transactions everytime. It doesn't save your preferences. I am actively looking for a new app.",
      "Love it. I'm definitely going to pay for this one to get the ads gone lol. not something I normally do for* apps. Edit: I'm not too keen on the new update. It's not all that bad, but it used to automatically set something as Expense or Income as it was saved previously, now I have to select them. Not a big deal but a mild annoyance.",
      "Been using the app for a while now. Helps keep track of all my expenses. I do have one suggestion, when you go to the recurring payment tab I would add a feature that adds everything together so you can go to it to get a quick glance of how much you have going out every month instead of adding them all together yourself. Just something to help save the user a little time"

      "So far I really like this app. I used Mint for a long time as well as another financial app. The Ads for Mint is so annoying and it's configurable options are limited. The other app had a good UI but a very limited mobile app. Sync with Simplify is seamless and the mobile app is very user friendly. The Web UI makes this a complete financial app. The only part that's lacking is itemization for investments.",
      "This app doubles many of the transactions, making the dashboard a complete nightmare. No easy way to mark duplicates. It's much worse at everything than Mint.",
      "Improving capabilities more and more. Really like the ability to manage recurring bills and income, which helps predict cash flow.",
      "This app could be so good. Lots of potential. It looks great, pretty easy to use. But, There's no customization for the dashboard. I don't want to see my spending year to date I want to see this months spending! It will not let you change anything on the dashboard. Lots of unhelpful information. Plus, my net income is wrong. Idk what is wrong with it but it is missing expenses and all of my accounts are linked to it. A real shame bc the app is very aestheticly pleasing.",
      "This app is very useful, especially if you have lot different banks and saving account to keep track on... im actually was surprise how many useful features, such as making saving goals💵, shows me my top spending graph 😱💸, how to reduce my financial spending and so much more. Plus, the pricing for premium isnt ridiculously expensive, so far its worth it, I really recommend this app."

Please do NOT deter me to uninstalling and reinstalling then restarting my phone. Just fix the app. Now the multiple timeframes pie chart is stuck in the same position. SMH",

      "I am disappointed that this app doesn't not work well enough to charge $40 annually. I have been a customer for 5 years and still can't readily get in touch with customer support. There have been multiple time where the app has synced in correctly, rendering it useless until I get in contact with support. Chat takes several hours. Emails have taken up to a week for a response. Support is an embarrassment and should be expanded. I'm not sure $40 is worth the frustration. Maybe vs 5 will be better",
      "Worst support for a paid service. Canceling my subscription has been a BATTLE since I can't remember my username - can't cancel from the app even if you're logged in (for some reason, even tho I signed up through the app, subs may only be cancelled through the web). Trying to get support to help me find my username has been a mess. I'm now in my 9th hour trying to get through to support. Ticketing system says I'm 54th in line - then 97th. Suddenly 1st, and I miss it for lunch. Just walk away.",
      "This is a scam. I signed up for the 30 day free trial, but you can't actually use your account without fully committing to a subscription and paying them. You can't cancel your account during the 30 day free trial because you do not have access to the account settings that allow you to do that. There is no email contact info for this company anywhere, chat help does not exist. Huge waste of time and now I have to worry that they will charge my credit card without my permission. Good times. 👎",
      "I loved this app before they upgraded and took the main 2 features I used away. The reoccurring transactions and the 2 different balance of my accounts.. current and available. I cancelled the app last year when it happened and haven't found a program since. Thought maybe I'd try this again but those features are the main things I want.. cancelled again but was still charged.. just cancelled again hopefully I wont get charged....",
      "Wouldn't let me create a password so I can't use it... It kept telling me to add special characters, which I did. It still wouldn't accept it Also, it really makes the app seem fishy when the terms of use check box is the same as the email list check box."

      "Worked great at first. Good visuals and easy to navigate and understand. As soon as my payment for the 6 month subscription went through, it stopped syncing to my bank account and displayed the wrong information. It won't re-sync properly and I've sent multiple emails to the support team with no response. Very dissatisfied.",
      "Decent app but the graphs are hugely inaccurate and very annoying. The peaks and troughs are in completely wrong places. Maybe you could have a data point for each day instead of the average type of graph you are doing at the minute? Also, my numbers keep on doubling for some reason. Some times it says my savings accounts are double, sometimes it says the amount I have spent in my budget has doubled e.g. I'm -200 instead of like 400 up.",
      "So far the app has been very helpful. I was able to spot that I was being charged by Amazon Prime incorrectly and could then put a stop to that. The UI is easy to use, if not a bit of an overload sometimes. Also, being able to set budgets for individual categories and having summaries of spending is great!",
      "Great app! I don't have a problem with debt. However what this app has shown, quickly, is that I was quite wasteful. It's described by some as childish, other than the jellybaby I don't see how. It's basic yes. Once you've set up all your direct debits, payments into categories, set your budgets etc. You're all set. You can see where to save in no time. Easy to use, easy to save. No brainer! Highly recommended. Worth spending the time to set up correctly...",
      "Expected way more ; UI : Wonderfull & beautifull. UX : Horrible, not intuitive except for budget. Cash : If you want to track your cash expenses you need pro and even there its not intuitive. Merchant & subscriptions : Really cool and work well, kind of a great idea. Missing sub-category, any analytic chart. Bugs : didn't detect bank fees, my cheking account was merge with my credit card as 1 account. There might be potential for the futur but right now \"Wallet\" from Budgetbakers is way better."

It's a massive waste of time, I may play 15 mins a day or so waiting to grind out 1000 soul (.22 cents) and it's basically going to take you months of daily time to make even $1 dollar in crypto. It's made for kids not adults. I actually saved up 1000 soul took me over a month of daily playing I got to level 27 and Quadrillions of coins. PLEASE Avoid this waste of time really bad game!",

      "Was not sure going in exactly what I was looking for in an app like this but after using for a couple weeks really came to love it. Takes pictures of receipts . Keep tabs of sales taxes for tax returns. Tons of stuff associated for businesses . Graphs. Detailed print outs. With categories of receipts. Reimbursable. Personal or corporate expenses. Etc. Seriously check it out. Great for companies or individuals AND best part is its absolutely free!",
      "Update: With help from the developer I figured out how to add categories!!! 5 STARS!! Does exactly what I want. I like this, it is simple to use. The only thing I wish it had was more categories. I am not using this for business, just a Mom trying to reduce paperword and track expenses and taxes. Outside of the \"meals\" and \"gasoline\" I wish there were things like groceries and items. Or give us the option to name our own categories. Otherwise it is a pretty decent app.",
      "Updated: I've been using this app for over 6 months, it is very accurate at scanning and capturing info from any receipt you put in front of it.. It's frustrating you have to buy scans rather than offer an plan that includes this feature. NOTE: be sure you know how to use the backup facility as the website is only a login portal that you can't view your receipts or track your expenses, this is managed in the app which is a little time consuming, would recommend you email them back to yourself to ensure have copies...",
      "Fairly useful features in one place e.g predictive text based on previous entries, image attached to text entry, reports (folders). Features I like most are the cropping tool, which has a magnifier, to position crop points, and the retake photo function. However, the OCR needs to be much improved and the price of OCR scans is about twice the price I would be happy with. I also like its simplicity.",
      "Slick very easy, love this app takes al the fuss out of expenses, you always have your phone take a photo or upload an image and it complies a very tidy expense report. I also use it to track personal spending and receipts I may need in the future. Very handy app"

I'd pay extra for this feature.",
      "Stock prices have an est 3 min lag. Otherwise would be graded higher. Features are superior to other like apps out there. The lag in live pricing is a huge detriment. The lag is on BITUSD. On weekdays, yes, its a few seconds behind. Maybe 5 to 10 secs. Transactions can also get murkey, esp when many. Maybe put the open and recent trades on top? Box off the closed trades, or paired off transactions? Cleaner trade log to read. There is lots of potential in this app.",
      "I have used it for about a month. Passwords are extremely annoying but if it could be as simple as some other sites such as capital one finger trace of a pattern, I would love to keep my data from the prying eyes such as a lost phone. Very thoughtful and easily learned.",
      "Good app for monitoring and for current news, but needs more options under the transaction tab to change the currency to whatever you like( Price per shares and commissions ). For example, if I purchased RY stocks, I'd like the option to change the price per shares and commissions to Canadian. Thanks.",

Not very intuitive to find previous months spending but not hard either Edit: after months of more use its done quite poorly and is glitchy at pulling in transactions. The support team was consistent and friendly in following up but really did nothing to fix the issue. The features make it a potential 5 star app but they have a lot to fix first",
      "Good for a baseline idea but not easy to keep going. Does not do well with consistent synchronization of income which constantly gives alerts as if ur not paid changing overview report into giving you bad data. Most likely will cancel my premium subscription if this cannot be resolved. Otherwise its pointless to keep using app.",
      "Easy to setup and shows me what I need to see: After bills, how much I can spend that month. I've tried every other budget tool and they are complicated and time consuming to manage. This one is really easy to setup and use and so far I'm loving it.",
      "The ideas behind the app are sound and the simplicity is really nice, but upgrading adds little to no additional features. It took several months to not require manually reconnecting banking information, there was a bug that caused some duplication of transactions (that has yet to be cleaned up) and generally a lack of some basic features make this app little better than a spreadsheet. The main reason I am deleting is due to the horriblely non responsive customer service.",
      "So far, I'm loving this app. I've downloaded and deleted at least 4 other budget apps. All I wanted was a simple, organized look at my bills and spending habits. Every other app complicated the process, so it took me hours just to link my accounts and set up my profile, only to find irreconcilable issues and being at square one again. I haven't had those problems, this app is easy and straightforward, takes you step-by-step through the process so you understand each function."

      "Great app. One suggestion i have is to open a video section & give the pro traders an option to explain things like options. A lot of new people come here & lose their money to more experienced Traders. You could also make money off video ads which I believe pay better and get you more traffic and maybe take some of those ads out of the chat area and it will make it look better. I love your app it's great it should just have more teaching tools to help people learn.",
      "Big fan of the app really great. The only thing that it's missing is a widget for my homescreen. I would love to see a widget that allows me to quickly look at the feed of peoples ideas about stocks without having to open the app. Sometimes I'm busy and I like widgets for that quick easy content. Highly recommend you guys develop one! Keep up the good work! Also make a version thats compatible for tablets!",
      "App takes about 16 to 20 minutes to open, using my Android. Moto Z2, all this took place on their last update. Prior to the up date I had zero problems. I asked ST for help but the only recommendation I received was to delete and reinstall. Did all that to no avail. Also I read quite a few comments and ST has responded to most with the exception of a handful complains such as mine . It has been since December 18 2019 since I was contacted by ST and provided the info and that was that.",
      "Erased my watchlist after an update, now says invalid access token when I try to retype what I remember. I did a lot of research to find those companies and time is money. Should've never trusted an app with something that important. Besides that, it's an ok app to get info from some traders. Beware of traders trying to trick you into buying bad stocks or dumping good ones.",
      "App is terrible. So loaded with ads and bugs it usually doesn't even start, just locks up your phone. Contacted devs, they did nothing but waste more of my time. Avoid this app."

      "Love using this app. It it very user friendly and you can categorize everything to your liking. I chose to pay extra for the \"Plus\" plan which allows more budgets... I like that I can have multiple budgets for different things like bills, vehicle, groceries etc. The notifications it gives me when im getting close to my budget or went over budget helps me keep on track. Wish there was a way to set up something other than a wallet for a credit card for example.",
      "I have started my free trial but have yet to be able to connect to my bank to even give this app a try. Everytime I try it gives me a screen after my password that says \"please select the contact information you want to use to log in\". Then a line, like I'm supposed to know what that is. I've tried entering \"text, \"mobile\" my phone #, \" \"cell\". Until I try a few times & it wont even let me connect again. I'd like to try it but cant even get past the 1st part",
      "Overall - nice but very buggy. I am using Spendee Plus plan and at some point it stopped synchronizing shared wallets. Every new transaction or edit causes an uninformative error message to pop up. Tapping on \"Contact customer support\" offers you to send a message to one of your contacts via any available messenger, the message is \"Need your help\". Seems like the users are supposed to help themselves...",
      "Tried Premium, but it wouldn't reconnect to my bank account with Halifax after the first day of setting up the app. I tried contacting technical support but never got a reply, only loads of spam emails. Can't understand how this is a paid subscription when the app doesn't work and there is no attempt to fix the connection issues. Edit- thanks for the quick response, I sent the email through the help button on your Web app. I also filled in a form sent to me by email about bank connection issues",
      "Best app in market to manage it money 💰 Easy & comfortable UI. Have one suggestion, if the user is able to select two tags that will be amazing. Eg: I can select food tag & travel tag, which means I spent 400 on food and my total travel spend will also be added. And that can be displayed in pie chart as second layer. Hell lot of effort required. But it's a great update."

You will get better results if you just never download this app and just put all of your money in a late L fund or just 100% in the C Fund or better yet, a mix of the C/S/I funds.     If you google \"I subscribed to TSP Tips so I could backtest it. Completely unsurprising results inside.\" you'll see a good analysis on Reddit for the performance of the service.",
      "This app is a good baseline but needs improvement. I rated 5 stars based on the function of it as it should theoretically pay for itself and save me lots of time in research. However, it is very bland with no features.",
      "Absolutely horrible, I was up most of the year managing myself started following once I joined. I have lost $20000 since I started following the advice seems to be a day late and a dollar short. So disappointed even after my friends convinced me to go to it for several years. I will be canceling this week. I should have known when the social media site sucked only 95 people liked it nothing been active on it for 5 years the website is horrible.",

      "This is a good app, I use it to keep track of my monthly budget and how much I'm able to save at the end of each month Had some trouble importing .csv of my banking statement, which aside from being able to copy the budget for each month is the reason I paid for the premium version. Ended up finding a solution by making the .csv just a regular .txt file. Again, had issues with formatting as it was bringing expenses in as income, but upon making a separate column for each and then telling the app to import both as one it finally worked. I'm giving the app 4 stars because it is a good app, but because of the troubles I ran into and having to spend nearly a whole day finding a workaround for functionality that you just expect to work the way they instructed if you've paid for the feature",
      "My experience with this app has been pretty good, more than I expected. For a while I've needed to put myself on a budget. I took my time selecting an app that would fit my schedule and how I wanted to plan the disbursement of my monthly financials to adequately cover my living expenses. This app is extremely easy to use. You can take away, you can add, update your information on your budget effortlessly. I recommend this app.",
      "Awesome feel in organize my home budget. I also need to change theme of the application.make it possible. There is no option to convert it into pdf make it possible. There demand of payment but other apps like day to day expenses provide these features free. So make it free . you get much increase in user of this app.",
      "This app should have an option whereby you can allocate SOME of your income to financial accounts... The option available right now takes all the income gained to the financial accounts if you enter the account name in the add income option.. Also the home pages must show the amount of income you've saved in the financial accounts then the matching concept should take be considered in this situation too... I wish I could send images to explain better",
      "Good app, balance between function and simplicity. I rate 4 but since you guys so kind to open a lot of functionalities for free, it's 5 :). I have some suggestion: - The default value when clicking to budget should be add transaction, since we use it more often. - Add option to transfer the remain of budget to other budget. Sometime we know the budget is done and we can move all of it left fund to other categories. - calculator should show result in realtime"

      "I've always been quite bad at tracking my hours and expenses. This app has made it so simple and straight forward for me. I can plug in my rent and other expenses to get a real reflection of what money I'll have after everything is said and done. Plus, it's as simple as plugging in my clock in and clock out times with my hourly pay rate. I literally have no guess work or opening up my calculator app to do now. I love this app.",
      "Really like what I see but I'd like to see an overview option where I can see the whole calendar with my work days marked in, even a week view would be nice similar to normal calendar apps. That would make it easier to visualize and understand when planning! Push notifications and reminders would be great as well. Thank you and I love this app so far",
      "Loving the app in the amount of time that I've been using it. Pretty easy way for me to track the hours that I've logged, really love the clock in feature. I kinda wish there were ways to customize the app because everytime I open it I think I opened the calendar app instead. They look very similar, as a matter a fact I believe the dev used the Google calendar app as a template.",
      "Wish I could automatically count overtime for any hours over 40 at a job and have the pay rate multiplied by 1.5. I separate punches at different jobs with tags, so it would be fairly easy I think to add a feature like this. I'd also like to be able to add a tag while punched in or choose a tag when I punch in or out, rather than having to go back and enter it after the entry is saved. Everything else is great so far",
      "I used to use a spreadsheet to keep track of hours which got really cumbersome because I had to make sure I remembered to open and edit the sheet on my computer. Using this app has made that a lot easier as I always have my phone on me and it's super simple to open the app and just press a button! Then it gives me an automatic hour calculation and my estimated earning!"

      "I really want to use this app with my partner, its exactly what we've been looking for - the problem is that while my partner, who uses an iphone, can set her envelopes' budget periods to be every two weeks, I dont have the same option on the android version of the app, only monthly and yearly! Its very annoying, and preventing me from using it effectively as my income is fortnightly - are there plans for this option to be added to the android version of the app too?",
      "Best budgeting app I've used by far. Very quick to load data. Doesn't ask for all of my personal information. Doesn't allow all transaction types from the app (income, debt payments, envelope filling) which is a bummer, but I use them infrequently enough that I can use the desktop version. Much better experience than Mint overall.",
      "The desktop website is great. However, the Android app is sorely lacking in features. The app completely ignores envelope groups, unlike the website which groups the envelopes in both the reports and in the envelopes list and allows you to collapse groups you don't want to see temporarily. I wish I could filter the envelopes on groups and filter transactions on accounts in the app. If I click on an envelope in the reports, I wish to see the corresponding transactions in that time range.",
      "Great app but I would like to know how to use it more effectively . I can't seem to tick off what I have paid in monthly expenses . So my income balance always shows a plus amount. It's not a realistic reflection of my money.",
      "Hello, so far I've used and paid for the app for a couple of years now. I would like to make another suggestion. Would it be possible to automatically subtract the amount of the whole summ once I use the split account function? Now I have to calculate it which is a little complicated in the app"

      "Been using this app on my iPhone for a while, wanted to backup and import the data to my android phone but it doesn't seem to locate the backup file properly. Keeps wanting me to log in but I see no reason to if it's supposed to let you use backup files to move data. Backing up and importing shouldn't be this hard.",
      "Im a NYC bartender, Been using Tipsee since 2018. Just recently updated my phone to the Samsung Note 10+ and when I tried to restore my data from the past 2 years it wasn't working. I contacted the support team and after a few attempts they were able to resolve the issue by updating the app.. Fast responses and very attentive to team. would definitely recommend others in the industry to use. Anyone leaving a negative review must be too lazy to contact support!! Thank you Tipsee!!!!",
      "I have used the app religiously for a few years now with very minimal problems; however, when this new update came out claiming that ALL the features will now be free, I cancelled my paid subscription, but now the app has reverted to the free version with none of the features available. Also, all of my previously reported wages have turned to zero's. I'm willing to give 5 stars once the issue is fixed.",
      "This app is amazing and helps you keep track of your cash tips. My favorite feature is how the app breaks down how much money you earned for the hours you worked.",
      "Really have loved this app, have used it in the past, but lost functionality when my phone was considered out of date. Have been using it again since 2017, but just recently it's been getting very buggy. When the new year hit, the graph function didnt work properly, 2020 wasn't available and would take me back to 2013 where there was no data. Today (1/22/20) I tried to see the graph function and it takes me to the apps feedback page. Which then itself doesn't work. Update 2/19/20* Back to 5 star"

      "This is a great little app. Very simple, straight and informative. Quick too. And easy to use graphs and analyse. Mainly intended for US Equity investors, therefore lacking on non-US funds and fixed income. Also it is hard/impossible to compare performance. But small size, speed and speediness beat the small drawbacks.",
      "I love this app. Especially the news feed!! But the only downside is that, i am not getting alerts/notification when there is a new article published against a company. I have to go through all companies in my watchlist from time to time to know the articles published against them. Instead, if i get a push notification when there is a new article for a company being tracked in my watchlist, it would be awesome!!",
      "Free version has a 5-trade limit, and you can only trade each symbol once. Starting a trade and not finishing it also counts as a trade, apparently. Delete and move on. Also, info is slow to load on 4G. Any website loads 10x quicker on the browser. Best feature: does not require logging into anything.",
      "Last updated June 2019, but they charge 1$/month to use without ads. This app needs to be 1$ to remove ads. If you're charging 1$/mth you should have an update every month at least. It's a good app to look at candle charts, zoom in zoom out, make lists... But missing a lot of features. Search isn't the best, some tickers don't show.",
      "a fantastic starting place for quick and dirty ticker data. there may be others, but the resources (on the free side) will have you considering the premium version.. especially if the stock market is part of your finance/billpay strategy! good job guys!"

      "A truly multi-talented money tracker. Eye-catching design that is easy to understand and start using. Very customisable with its look: date, currency, categories etc. I very much recommend, it can be used differently to meet everyone's need. Besides expenses, you can seperately track your income, savings, goals, budgets! It's never slow, innacurate and doesn't take alot of space. And all this about the free version, I have thought about buying premium in the near future because it's worth it.",
      "I loved it so much I bought the Premium version, which says a lot as I never pay for apps! I love the ability to customise categories, the pretty layout. One cool thing is that within a category, you can create subcategories, e.g.\"flights\", \"accomodation\" in \"travel\" - that way, you don't have to type it every time, and you can also see how much is spent on what. There are lots of features that I'm not using, like being able to save your monthly records and print them. 100% 👍!",
      "Nice application with attractive design, simple input and a great widget. However, there are 4 issues. (1) It lacks recurrence end date (2) the transaction has no time (hours & minutes), specially when it is required to sort transactions according to time during the same day (3) it will be great if each transaction shows the total balance along with each input for each account (not from starting & projected balance). (4) refund is reflected in the account not in categories amount or in overview.",
      "Overall, I'm satisfied with the app, although I would like the developers to add a feature with which we can have a description added to the expense, for example the list of groceries, the destination, etc. We are able to add the descriptions, but they are not saved when the app is closed. For the time being I'm giving it four stars because of its functionality. I will give it five stars once the feature has been added. Keep up the good work!",
      "Love the flexibility of this app (particularly with the lifetime upgrade which was really inexpensive and totally worth it). I REALLY wish it had a web version so I could pull it up on my computer when I really need to dig into things. My favorite part might be the ability to customize the colors and pictures. It makes budgeting and tracking more enjoyable!"

      "Fantastic app. Here's why: 1. The stocks he picks go up. It's that simple. Of course, stocks never just go up. They have down days as well. But many of the stocks you see in the top 100 of the app will remain there for a long period of time. This is especially great for market timing, but there are even some options for day traders. 2. In-depth quant analysis of a stock. It's just numbers. There is no emotion, no prediction based off of management, no prediction based off of intuition; it takes the emotion out of the equation with picking stocks. 3. The UI is simple. Obviously, the interface is not the focus of the app. It's a financial tool, not Candy Crush. The UI is no-nonsense and keeps the focus on the stocks. Keep in mind this is a financial tool. This shouldn't be the only arrow in your quiver. You still need to look at charts and do calculations. But this is a very potent combination of momentum and valuation, and it's worth the $10/month to get all 5200+ stocks.",
      "great information burried inside a really crappy UI",
      "A paid subscription does not allow me to log in, and tells me to contact support. But has no support to contact. Dont waste your time or money.",
      "I used this app several years ago when Subscribing was a bit cheaper.  It was ok for what is did for the price. These days, I think the subscription price would be too much for what the app actually does..",
      "i signed up on June of 2015 with Mr. Gunderson(mr,G) with his minimum required to help me to me some money . it tool his over a month to start,when i call to see why he is not doing anything with my account he said \"he is methodical\" it took him another couple of weeks to do any thing.and he started buying high and selling low for several stock,so i sent him an email \" why are you going to make me some money and why you are keep buying those stock and selling them low.\"he got very mad and started insulting and disrespecting and told me to take my account some where else ( i was a paying customer)( i have the email)...... the story is too long ,so with in a month or tow he lost over 6000.00$. of my money. full report later(?) if i have to and more......"

      "Great app, but my reporting period is 25th to 25th, so month by month doesn't help me. I need to report, especially budget wise, from the 25th to the 25th. I'm sure a lot of users might have similar \"non standard\" reporting periods. Can you guys maybe look at incorporating this as far as budgets are concerned? For example, the majority of my expenses for February will take place from the 26th to the 31st January, but they're allocated to January which skews the reporting.",
      "The devs are absent. Been waiting a couple of months for an email I've sent and no answer whatsoever, communication is something I find essential especially for an app that you pay a subscription (or buy the lifetime version since it has the option). The app is good, not great, and definitely not bad, but there are some things that they should work on. And if there is no communication from them it's safe to assume they just moved on and they will no longer respond or will make any mayor updates",
      "The best budget app ever in the app store 👌👍. I found a bit unprofessionalism from the developer. They simply disregard of your expectation from the app. I had the request of adding option of choosing any photo from gallery to be set as custom icon. They simply reject to be satisfied with the built in icons. Another request was to make any account to be excluded from total (there surely has the option but not working actually) so that I might use my office account in parallel but in vain.",
      "The app is beautiful but only in English. With arabic usage, I can't be able to add data as a new entry or new expense. I hope to develop the application in Arabic like the other languages that work in the application correctly.",
      "It has been super helpful and efficent for me using this app..really helps me budget expense and be able to monitor the income vs expenses...the categories also helps guide me on what I spend most on money and gives me idea on how to& where cut back unnecessary expenses to be able to save👍👍"

      "This app is very simple and very well put together. However, I am giving one star due to the fact that when observing your annual savings chart, the app only factors in expenses (non-recurring) and not bills (recurring). This is a big problem due to the fact that a vast portion of everyones monthly expenses stems from bills. If this feature could be implemented, I would gladly return and give this 5 stars.",
      "I typically don't review apps however I found this one especially helpful. It has a good ui/ux and most of the functionality that is needed to quickly track and log expenses. I gave it 4 stars not bc a lack of quality but because I think that it could use abit of tweaking on the yearly/monthly savings overview. It would be nice if it showed a monthly breakdown of expected savings based on the bills/expenses that are recurring minus the recurring income. Other then that, timelybills is fantastic.",
      "I am about 80-90% satisfied with this app. It is the only one I was able to find that does NOT connect to any of my bank or credit card accounts. I am just NOT ready for any apps to have direct contact to any of my personal business as there are a lot of them that does. I rather enter any information manually. The only other thing I would like to see with this app is the ability to see my running balance as to how much I have left to spend on the home screen. This is very important to me!",
      "Very nice and neat app, love it! Paid for the ads-free version on third day of use , totally worth it. Potential enhancements: finger print or facial login, allow to backup at google cloud, after upgrade to ads free version show more features on dashboard, like budget and settings, since there is more screen real estate, also after ads free upgrade push some useful articles on dashboard, such as good money habit.. Bug: top right 3 dots -> settings -> any option -> go back, it goes to main dash",
      "I really like that I don't have to connect this to my bank account. I can get reminders of bills and a view of, say, bills due or anticipated this week. I only would like to be able to see bills and income on the same screen so I know if a certain bill is covered by an upcoming check or not."

      "I am a huge admirer of this app. It is really easy to use and has great reports The only drawback seems to be the ad. They were very distracting. I looked at the purchase price to remove the ads and it was a little steep for someone who doesn't own their own business. I could see this being a great business expense. But not for personal use.",
      "First after using for free for months I get blocked out and see I have to now pay $59. Sobyoubare holding all my info hostage, now when trying to setup on my new phone none of the information synced.... So what exactly is the fee for? This app would be amazing if there was no bait and switch and if it didn't flake. Really how can you charge so much and not transfer the data when the user upgrades their device?",
      "Love this app! It's exactly what I needed for my business and personal needs. The only thing that's missing is the ability to sync with another device. What if you for example have one phone where all your data is on, then you have to switch phones. There is no way of syncing with another device. You would just have to lose all your data or export it. I plan on using this app and hope they upgrade this to be able to sync.",
      "Without warning the recent update removed months worth of receipts. Now they want a subscription, well take a number jerks. There is not indication on the app that if I subscribe that I'll even get my data back. You dont own my data, i should be charging you. All users, go to your internal storage/Android/Data/com.glority.receipt/Files and copy out your receipt images to put into another app, or better yet just put into a spreadsheet. I get wanting me to pay, but where is the human decency?",
      "This app looks good and does a good job of capturing receipt information and has some customizable features, so not bad 👍 for a free use service, but that is all lost when all your receipts folders and information has be wiped without notice..."

With regular news reports and comparisons this is a must have for any level of user.",
      "Almost in line with coinbase prices (exchange I use atm) since there widget is useless and app doesn't give notifications this is a great help setting up alerts that work and track prices roughly in real time. Would be 5 stars if you could sync prices with a certain exchange as i have to open coinbase to double check as it never quite matches but as mentioned does the job. Thanks for the response Dev, I get that and appreciate any future updates.",
      "Very cool interface and features. I was going to pull the trigger on pro. But I've found the price notifications are very delayed. Which is a critical feature for me.",
      "The news articles inside the app use an internal browser that contains no pop up blocker, so anything you read will be quickly replaces by an advertising banner that you cannot remove, except by going back and trying again. The process repeats itself on many different news sites.",
      "This was a great app that I used for an alarm. The alarm has stopped working though... kind of the selling feature for me."

      "Update. It does look like the problem has been remedied for now. The app is very good, and working as usual. I like the new (?) calculator addition🙂 Intrusive ads on the paid version! I bought the app only to find I am continuously being interrupted by intrusive ads while I am trying to enter data. Very disappointed. The app is fine. I didn't know I would be interrupted with ads even after paying for the app. Intrusive.",
      "very easy to enter transactions. only thing I miss from previous app is subcategories eg motor with sub categories for tax fuel insurance mot and maintenance. otherwise best app I've used Ann Sword love the subcategories another enhancement would be balance showing after every transaction which would make balancing easier to bank statement",
      "Excellent app. One question: do you have an option to automatically transfer my unused monthly budget residual to the next month's budget?",
      "I bought this app same day I downloaded it, about a week ago. I use it daily to record my income from 20 different accounts. I record my spending also. The budget feature doesnt seem to work right, or I'm not doing it right. Which is a bummer but I'm really loving this app. Real shame you cant use it on more then one device at a time without subscribing. It would be real nice to be able to delete categories and subcategories.",
      "It's a great app. I wish it was quicker to sync when you have multiple people set up to the same account other wise it's been perfect."

      "After working fine for years, app stopped working. Both portrait and landscape models are frozen. Developer does not respond to email help request. OK... an update here. I found a ”solution” (more like a work-around) from other reviewers. To paraphrase, if the app does not reply to input, turn the phone on its side into landscape mode. Tap ”Menu”, then ”Reset”. That made the app function again but does not excuse the total lack of response from HP. Leaving rating at 2 for that reason.",
      "I have had this app for years and it was useful, just like the physical calculator. It recently stopped working and Uninstall and re-install did not fix the problem. Maybe the October 2019 update broke the app. In any event, it is useless now.",
      "I used to love this app... But now it has stopped working, and it no longer responds to user inputs. The haptic feedback works, but there is no number display, which renders it useless The last update is listed as late October, so I suspect that screwed things up. Let's get on it, HP! Okay - it seems that all I needed to do was to re-set the application, and now it works perfectly. That puts it back up to 5-star territory. There was no better financial calculator & there is no better emulator.",
      "Recently purchased the Galaxy Note 10+ now this app doesn't run on this device. Have uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn't work. Wonder what HP will do about it? I have just discovered if you go into landscape view hit the menu then reset. It started to work.",
      "Stopped working suddenly but a few weeks later after re-installing it worked again. I use this app for work and paid for it, so I expect it to work ALL the time! When it does work, it's great. Just like the old HP-12C."

      "FX Meter +/- recommendations don't correlate to trading opportunities. The challenge with this app is that the information is too old and by the time the app provides its daily updates, there are very few opportunities to make profits. I find the app and system to be a total waste of money. In response to Black Tower, you should really review what your associate Navin from Urban Forex states on his YouTube videos. He discusses in several videos the correlation of the FX Meter to making trades.",

      "Stay on top of your spending with Volkron Checkbook. I love this app and without it I would have a much harder time tracking deposits and withdrawals. I would like to see one simple improvement however that would increase the usability of the app. Instead of long pressing on an entry to duplicate it, I think it would make more sense to long press to remove a line item. Whenever you want to remove an item you have to go into the entry and click the trash icon and then confirm to remove it.",
      "Great alternative to writing on a paper register. All the math is done for you and it' easy to correct wrong entries. I wish there was a setting that didn't allow changes to verified entries. If verified, why would you need to change it? If you're going to allow this, at least change the color so we can easily tell when something has been altered. Access from another device so others could also use it is really a must have for joint accounts.",
      "I love this app. I'm one of those that I have to balance my checkbook to the penny or I freak out. I love that once I tap that a payment has been verified, I see the available balance of what I should have, and the verified balance, of what my bank account shows. So much easier to balance, as the verified amount should be exactly what my bank app shows. Thank you for a simple app that does exactly what I want with no extra bells and whistles that I am required to use. I haven't used any additional features yet, such as the backup, transfer, or statements, just the checkbook register.",
      "This is exactly what I was looking for and I am beyond glad that I took a chance on trying it out. There are no ads to interfere, it's incredibly easy to learn how to use and even easier to use, period. So simple, quick and to the point to use, so easy to check at a glance on exactly where you're at in your bank account. It's so nice to be able to pay for stuff, jot in the amount on your phone at the same time, and always know your balance at any given moment. Love this!!!"

      "Super solid calc, that actually shows all TVM values at the same time! If I'm nitpicking, I'd say the orange and blue alt-function fonts could be a bit larger _before_ toggling them on (LG G6). They're certainly huge _after_ toggling, but then I have to toggle both to read everything. Also some button skeuomorphism would rock. Maybe tint the bottom third of each button, for that HP look? Just a thought. Still, nice work!!",
      "This app is bewildering to me. I got this calculator so i can learn how to manage money. But the buttons have cryptic abbreviations - how can i find out what they all mean? I paid extra so I'd have every option available to me, such as Date calculations. I cant figure out how to use it, and I cant find any help in the app or on their website. This is just one of the many things on the calculator that I cant use because so much of it is unexplained. A manual or built-in help is needed!",

It is simple enouigh to use, but there are many more options that I do not need. A program that looks simple can always be explored for a more complex solution.",

Nothing like a notification of a giant unexpected profit due to a candlestick @ 3am. Keep up the good work devs. I did have a small issue, I e-mailed support and got a response in hours. *Please, read, watch, and educate yourself on what these functions do/how they work. Mistakes can be made*",

      "App is great, except for obnoxiously loud ads. I understand you need ads to make money, and that's fine. But is it really necessary that those ads play at the loudest possible volume when I use the app at my restaurant. It's disturbing guests and getting me in trouble.",
      "I've been using this for a little over 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I'm a server and it's so hard to keep up with exactly how much I make. This makes that's 100% easier. This way I can not only see what I make a month and weekly but also which days tend to be my better days! Definitely worth the download!",
      "Absolutely perfect. Im old school and was very skeptical. I used to track EVERYTHING on paper (Tips, hours, tip out, sales, section, dry cleaning fees etc) and now its all on my phone. This app is hands down the best thing for any tipped position. I love the charts/comparison feature. Thanks for the awesome app!",
      "Does exactly what I want to do. I watch videos for premium because I'm cheap, but the videos aren't intrusive and are very much worth it. Only thing I would like is to be able to tap on a previous day that I've worked on the calendar and see the detailed breakdown and percentage for that day. Overall great app, keep it up devs!",
      "So i'm a full time server. I've had another app to keep up with my tips.. This one was much better. So became a premium member in 3 days using it and its been a week now. Support help was on point on helping me navigate through app. You cand add multiple jobs, different postions with thier different wages so it auto inputs when you select your postion and when putting your hours it auto calculates for you and if the tracks your tip outs."

      "I downloaded it yesterday, It seems like a nice concept but maybe due to some technical glitches I'm unable to fetch the share details (not able to buy, sale, or watch). Thus, I feel I am wasting my much of time for nothing. I look forward for improvement.",
      "Nice app GLITCH FOUND: If I were to buy a share at 90(current price) at 11am and order a sell with limit 120, and restart the app, it will sell the share if the price was higher than 120 even before 11am. SUGGESTION: note a time stamp for sell order and execute order only when share price go higher than limit price after the time stamp of sell order.",
      "I really enjoy this simulator for the fact that it aligns with the market beautifully. The only criticisms I give it is that it doesn't sell options and you can trade when the market closes to take the after hours profits without any risk involved. Overall great app I reccomend using it if you're trying to learn how to invest or just want some practice under your belt before you start really investing into the stock market.",
      "I'm enjoying the app. I wonder if there's a sort of a glossary or index that helps us understand the numbers and tips on what to look for in a stock regarding its performance history and media info that can influence buying and selling. Secondly, it says you can ask for more in app money. I've tried but it's like there's nothing there. Anyway, I'm enjoying it, it's the closest you can be to playing the stock market without loosing your shirt.",
      "This app is a great tool to learn how the stock market works and how to buy/sell stocks. The $5 for premium is extremely affordable and allows you to have the ability to buy/sell unlimited amounts of stocks, without having to watch an ad once you go over the daily amount. I see a lot of complaints in the review section and those people are apparently extremely ignorant and shouldn't even have a smart phone, let alone try to invest in stocks."

One of my favorite things is that it tells me the updated news on each and every individual stock that I list in my watchlist. I no longer have to google each one every morning. This app is just AMAZING! I can tell when my stock is bullish/bearish....undervalued/overvalued.... and where analysts think the price target should be. Kudos to the developers on this app. Very very pleased!!",
      "This is a very good app with lots of useful data. But what really got me to write this review is that this finally is a stock market app with actionable data and minimal ads. Most other finance apps are overloaded with obnoxious ads and ask you to subscribe just to make the experience bearable. Thank you FundSpec for respecting your users and providing a wonderful experience for your free users as well!!",

I stumbled upon this app again and realized it was what I needed at the time. I'm so happy to use it. It helps me consciously understand and be mindful of my money. Thank you for making this app!",
      "great way of tracking what you spend!!",
      "Easy to use and gets the job done. Which is good. However i don't like the idea of everything that happened in 2019 and before to become irrelevant because of their yearly/monthly filters. Would be nice if we can view \"last 6 months\" or last year. To include data from previous months. Also we can only filter one category at a time, which seems an easy fix. Would be nice if we can filter 2 or more categories for a comparison. Etc",
      "Awesome so far. I'm finally getting all my finances in order. While it's amazing what you spend If you keep track it. So far very few ads and the app is running perfectly not a single hitch. So after one month I am deeply impressed. I never a take the time to read an app.. This time I am making an exception. Good job.",

      "The paid version is excellent. No adds, no crashes, accurate information. The paid app is worth it if you're really into penny stock study on the go. One star off bc of the black background interface. You can't change it, seems like. But that's an aesthetic thing. If you like that, consider this a 5-star review.",
      "It works very well, better after I subscribed for 5 bucks. Sometimes it takes a little long to load some searches, but I figure it's the perfect opportunity to gain patience since patience is a critical characteristic to have as a successful trader. Thanks for the app. They do improve gradually.",
      "Good app but when searching and scrolling and after refining your list it will display an ad. After the ad it will reset your list back to square one, aggravating",
      "This is all very new to me. But it is easy to navigate.",
