      "So far cashapp has been a pain in my side it worked well for a week, now I can't send payments receive payments or anything. I have contacted support and asked for a phone call but no! Email only. So, I have emailed them the past few days with the issues and am getting nowhere with them. For some reason my account appears to be locked down, and it will not verify my email, Picture ID, social or anything. I would not recommend this if you just dont feel like dealing with headaches.",
      "The best I use it all the time. So easy. I use it mostly with family. When I need a couple of bucks to hold me over until check day. Your money is added to your cash card in minutes. Oh I forgot to say you can get your own a debit card straight from the app. Pre signed for easier verification. 5* in my book. Now with all the upgrades bitcoin and now stocks options are being added to the app. Awesome!!!. no more trying to figure out on how to buy or even trade stock. #Lovingit!!! #Giveitatry",
      "cash app is good but not great. Very often I get stuck on a page I didn't want to go to and can't get out of. Although payments are quick and easy, sometimes there are glitches and it is difficult to get timely help. Today I bought bitcoin. Easy. I sent it in payment for something. It never arrived. Not only that, but the transaction did not show up in my transaction list so I can't prove it. But the bitcoin certainly DID disappear out of my wallet. The amount missing is $201 USD. I wrote to support but it will take 24 hours to get a response. I am not happy.",
      "Well, this app and I have had our struggles that's for sure. I was the last of the cash first kids to not understand the basics of checking accounts, debts, credit s, etc. But I have always liked this app because of its popular brand recognition and by how hard it is to hack into the account IF you don't know a whole lot about the basics of the weakness of passwords in general. One thing I do not like, is how it isn't clear you need a square account on a separate device",
      "Very convenient, VERY FAST, & very low fees. Way better than Google Pay. Google Pay allows previous money that has been sent months before intentionally, to be credited back to them (even though they were legit transactions). That's allowing fraud, & now they show a negative of thousands. I would highly encourage to use CashApp instead."

Because of that response, I moved it from 3 stars to 2 stars).",
      "This app is terrible. Their security is awful. Their response on trouble tickets is even worse. It also leaves you hanging to where you don't know if they even got your message. They can't do anything right. A couple months after I listed the comments above I tried to request funds from somebody and instead venmo sent them funds putting my account in the negative. I can not warn you enough, so not use this app it's terrible.",
      "*update* Venmo solved my issue quickly. I appreciate their customer service and now I can use Venmo again! Woohoo!!* Tried to install the app but won't let me verify my phone number so I couldn't even get passed the registration part. Kept saying 404 error.",

That was then, this is now.it keeps telling me that my debit card can't be used for instant transfers. it worked fine with Wells Fargo but when I switch to chase now it's giving me misery up the ass."

      "Superb interface - Garbage Stability: This app is by far the most intuitive and beginner friendly option I've encountered. Unfortunately, the stability of the trading system is straight up garbage. Users were locked out of their account for the entire day of March 2nd, 2020; and the first half of March 3rd, 2020; during which the S&P 500 bounced up 8% from it's previous weeklong plummet. Do not trust this company with critical day to day trades, they have no qualms about shutting down the system",
      "So I figured I would give this app a try. Not looking good. It kept telling me it's losing connection, and then its having a server issue. Right after I put ALL my information in. Wont let you look at stocks. Just sends you to a blank page. So far this has been a horrible experience. Not sure I would invest money into this if you cant even navigate the app properly.",
      "So far this app is a major disappointment. The platform is solid. The problem is, it is extremely glitchy during peak hours. Which makes its users lose money. I keep getting server errors and apparently I'm not the only one. I've looked it up and many other users are having trouble with the glitches as well. If it continues I will no doubt pull my money out.",
      "Can't even really get started with the app. I have been trying to link my account. I have tried multiple times over the course of 24 hrs. I keep getting a message \"oops we can not ....\". I have checked the help section and couldn't find anything that directly addressed it (it is not the 1 factor authentication either). I have sent a message to support in 24hrs have only got the immediate auto reply. The app seemed like the best choice after reading various articles but it's useless with the bugs",
      "Decent app for buying/selling but its features are still pretty limited. That said, their customer service is a joke. Tried to cancel a transfer to/from my bank. I had to send an email and was advised a wait time of 1-3 days before someone would get back to me. 3 days later no response, except a new automated message stating my transfer was in process now and I can no longer cancel it. What a joke."

      "Having my PayPal account, and PayPal Cash card has been very convenient and easy to use. I have ran into situations where I was looking to make a purchase and the only form of payment a seller or retailer would accept is PayPal. I love the fact that PayPal insures your transaction. Also everything about using My Card and PayPal account has been smooth and easy. Thanks PayPal!!!",
      "Almost useful apart from stupid login. Enter my password and it sends a code via text, read the text and it's logged you out of the App. Log back in and repeat the same thing again and again. Only way to successfully log in is to have texts open on my PC using Android messages. Even if I open texts on my mobile before logging into the App as soon as I switch to the texts it logs me out again.",
      "Can never use the app, every time after logging in, and entering code for 2FA, it goes to a blank screen with a X in the upper left corner. If I click the X, I have to login again and do 2FA code again, and then back to the blank screen. If I reinstall the app, it works maybe one time before doing the blank page thing again. I can get get into the app. It's been like this for months now. Nothing seems to ever really fix this issue, and many others seeing the same issue. Please fix this!",
      "I use PayPal for direct deposit from work, and I love it more than any bank I've ever been with. I have a card I can use anywhere in person or online, and the balance on the app is immediately updated so i always know exactly what's in my account. I'm also provided with a detailed list of what & when my expenses were. And money can be sent immediately to other paypal users. No waiting or fees. You can even create savings accounts or money pools. This is an incredible app & i adore paypal.🖤",
      "Good App. Works great for family, shopping, and even some bill payments. My only complaint is that funds received notifications have no option to transfer to your bank. Selecting any option from the notification closes the app instead of prompting you to login to continue. This could be streamlined. Maybe leaving the app logged in would remedy that, but that would be a security risk in my opinion. Every other aspect of the app seems awesome. It's a Must have."

      "Amazing App, it goes beyond just telling you what your balance is, it breaks down what you've spent abd where. As well as tells what the recommended weekly budget should be to make your balance last all month. Plus it helps you find work, and provides links to company's that offer you discounts if you are an EBT recipient. Awesome, just awesome! 🤙💯🙌",
      "So I guess it's happening to other ppl also, but I cannot log in to see my balance! Everytime I try it says invalid info! So finally I tried to make a new account, enter new information and it still tells me something is invalid!!! This is so frustrating. I have had this app for a couple years and never had any problems, until now! I have also tried calling to talk to a live person about the problem but can't get ahold of anyone at the#. Please fix this problem! Until recently this app was great",
      "Awesome app!! Been using it for a while now. No more calling the EBT line for balance. Easy, helpful, & informative. Not only does it give your balance, but it helps with teaching you how to stretch your funds to last the whole month. It even lists job openings & other programs for assistant!!",
      "Aside from the quick convenience of accessing your EBT balance and info, this app has a ton of helpful tips and options for people on a tight budget. You can \"clip\" hundreds of coupons from your local grocery store, learn how to get Amazon Prime for 50% off just for having EBT benefits, plus you can access many options for improving job skills (for free), fixing your resume, finding jobs with flexible hours, and more. This app is the cat's pajamas! Glad I found it.",
      "EXCELLENT. JUST EXCELLENT! I love this app to the tenth power. Thank you to the creators of Fresh EBT - Food Stamp App. No more calling the number on the back of the card when you have something left to spend but forgot how much it is. Love it, love it, love it!"

      "I'm so frustrated, I can't get in to my account, it keeps giving me a message saying that something's wrong with my phone number. There's nothing wrong with it; it's the correct number & my online company who I work for will soon be using this app to transfer my money. Right now they're using clearxchange which will soon be Zelle. What to do?! I'm afraid my money will be lost once the company takes over clearxchange. Zelle please help!",
      "I couldn't even sign up for my first ever zelle transaction. Great first impression. Didn't have my bank available, I tried adding my debit card, error popped up to call customer service, no number or link to be found. No I'm not going to spend time looking for the number, I rather write a bad review. I guess I'll never use this app. 👍🏼",
      "Terrible app. My bank never comes up, so I enter the debit card info manually and each time it say \"Uh oh, there's been an error\" proceeds to delete all 2 pages of info I filled out, and the cycle continues. Plus, I know for a fact my bank uses Zelle, because from my bank's app, I can send money using Zelle. Zelle in general is fine; the app is s#!% Use Venmo. It's miles better.",
      "Got an email notice from a friend trying to send me money. To accept, I had to enter my bank. My bank is not listed, so it defaults and tells you to open the app. Unfortunately, the transaction isn' queued up in the app, so you have to request funds from the same person. Now's there's two requests outstanding and no one is getting paid. Zelle needs to close this gap and fix this hole.",
      "I've used this for a long time with no trouble and recently someone sent me money and it says I have to accept it. If I click on the link they have my bank in the list but an error pops up everytime. If I use the app they don't even have my bank and if I enter in my information an error pops up again. The one time I was able to get my account I didn't have any pending activity and can't accept the money."

      "Other than the glitch from 2 or 3 months ago... The app works very well. Chime is pretty cool, and I have used them for over a year now. I would kind of like to know why every few weeks I will get a notification that my card was declined somewhere, even though I have my card with me all the time... Or why occasionally it will randomly notify me that Chime covered me with a Spot Me, even though I never tried to purchase anything that would have taken my account into the negative.",
      "I downloaded this app mainly for the round up to savings feature. Whenever I make a debit card transaction it says pending for 2-3 days, and then it rounds up the money to my savings. If I make a bunch of transactions in one day, I have to remember that. Every other debit card I've had if I use my PIN my money's taken out instantly. At least I get notifications after each transaction.",
      "The app. is so easy to use. I've had Chime for the better part of a year now, and I have no complaints. There's a map to find ATMs, and place that will give cash back. As long as I plan it ahead of time, I can easily send out a check. Adding to my savings is super easy, too. My one complaint is that the APY for my savings account has dropped drastically.",
      "Greatest banking app I have used to date. No over drafts fees, option to over draft up to $100. Waives my ATM fees. Easy direct deposit, get paid 2 sometimes 3 days sooner. Great and fast customer service. I have not had one issue with the card. User friendly app with literally no bugs, up to date balance, and daily balance. The change to roll over change into your savings and collect interest! Love.. love...love chime! Oh, and the $50 refer a friend rocks too!",
      "I've had this bank for a few years, it's awesome. You don't have to worry about overdrafts (because you can't). Although now it has an option to let you overdraft up to $100 with no fees. And the debit card design is very sleek, it's all white. Works with apple pay and Google pay. Chime is dope af! I just wish there was a dark theme option, white backgrounds are so gross!"

      "Great tool to rebuild credit. Was hit by a bad financial situation years back. The app gives you access to a general estimate of your credit score which you would otherwise have to pay for at no impact. This helps you determine if and when you should apply for a new loan. It also gives you tips on how to raise your score. At first I thought the sponsored credit cards were a scam. Fees and high interest. But I wasn't getting access to credit another way so think of it as an investment.",
      "This app has really helped me improve my credit. I have used it to dispute several items on my credit report AND QON. I have used the suggestion that it gave to improve and my score has improved. It's only been less than 2 months and I have seen improvements. I will continue using this app but I will also be using this app for my daughter. I want her to know her score and keep up with her information.",
      "I never new I needed this app but it is amazing and I love it, easy to use, teaches you and helps you with raising your credit. I'm close to excellent credit! It feels amazing, if I'd had known sooner about how important credit is and how to manage it I would have download the app sooner. It would have helped me immensely.",
      "I absolutely LOVE Credit Karma!!! It is so easy to use, and it tells me EVERYTHING that I need to know about my credit. It notifies me when there is any change at all to my report. Also, it provides numerous credit card offers and odds for approval... as well as personal loans, and more. It's PERFECT!!! Thank you so much for this app!!! ❤️🙏",
      "Very helpful app. Provides you with your credit scores, tells you how to improve them, helps dispute marks on your credit report if needed, and alerts you to any suspicious or so fraudulent activity on any of your accounts. Also provides links for new cards and personal loans that may be within your credit range if you're looking to pay off high interest rate cards."

      "For the past (almost) year I've been trying to update my personal info on the app and it hasn't let me due to it having errors. Even called in for customer support and they were minimal help. And I often lose access to the capability of checking the update of my credit score. Was able to check it a week (or so) ago but can't see it again for some strange reason. I've checked the app store to see of this app needs an update and there aren't any updates required for it. Completely dissatisfied.",
      "This app is very easy to use! This is my first credit card as I was raised not to buy anything if you can't pay for it in cash, but quickly learning that credit is more important than I was taught! I'm not confident that the credit score they say is mine, is accurate. I want to pay with a debit card but they won't allow it. Also my score dropped 60 points in one week because I used this card for $100, TO BUILD CREDIT! If I get penalized for using this to build credit again I will cancel it!!!!!",
      "Great app and easy to use. I greatly appreciate the functionality of this app, and how I cannot only make payments, but can temporarily suspend my card when I cant find it, or shut it down completely if need be. Moreover, everything is current concerning my balances and when my next payment is due. Also, I feel secure with my pers. info. on my device knowing that you log me out of the app automatically when I havet been active within a few minutes.Great app Capital One I really mean that.",
      "In general, app works well. My biggest complaint is regarding mobile deposits, which require photo of front and back of check, and input of memo, but app does not provide the photos or memo when reviewing activity (nor desktop website). This has created problems for us when 2 deposits of same amount on same day were made and only 1 shows up in activity. We can't tell which one we need to resubmit. Furthermore, the chat never works and no other means of questioning the deposit is provided.",
      "Perfect app! Charges post instantly,,even those pending process; my bank should take note. You can also turn any card (as well as cards given to authorized users) off & then on again w/out going through the mess following the use of \"report lost/stolen card\" feature. Chose that, you end up having to set up an entire new card, wait to receive in mail, etc. CapOne's feature allows you to switch it off (in the event you've misplaced it), then use the app to allow usage again once found. Perfect!!"

You need 5 credit card types .then it picked out what was best matched for me with my score and how i spend already etc ,etc..

      "I used Turbo tax for the very first time i done my taxes by myself. It was a little harder that i expected but i got it done. Having to wait now because i didnt print them off right away ( i used my cellphone to file instead of computer) , it said it needed some kind of attached voucher when i printed it off. I ended up calling DOR and they gave me a number to put in the memo. Still waiting for my return and that means still waiting to purchase diff vehicle.... :((",
      "The app cost $150 for what I can get everywhere else for less than $20. Plus the app has become cumbersome and deceptive, with adds after every section. I used TurboTax for years but no more. The response I got was a form response and doesn't remove any fees. In fact it only highlighted their deceptive fee practices. I want to be clear that the service I required that took my bill to $150 was the form for my student loan repayment. I used another service and it was free.",
      "I would gladly recommend TurboTax, but not the app. This year I used the app instead of filing on a computer like I normally do. I was not happy with the app. It made the experience much more stressful by randomly saving and forcing you to go back to the beginning of a section and only to click through everything all over again and to add insult to injury, it repeatedly throws an upgrade for some Max service each time it makes you restart. I'll keep using TurboTax, but just not the app.",
      "The real free version is hidden! If you make less then like 60k, you qualify for a truly free version. The app will ask you pay (and not show the IRS free file option) if you have one of the many pretty common tax situations. The IRS free file version through tubo tax is through there web interface ONLY and it's far inferior to the app. You can, however, start on the app and when it tells you to pay, you can convert using the web version and continue with the info you already entered.",
      "This is my 4th year using TurboTax and I have no complaints so far! Its Simple, they help you along the way. They double, triple check at times and they are reasonable on prices for filing electronically. This to me is the cherry on top, or strawberry whatever your preference!!! Its much better than those liberty, H&R etc. Places. The convenience alone is worth it. I don't have to travel to file or receive my money. A+"

      "Almost every time I try to sign in the screen does nothing. So I push the button again, and nothing happens again. I close the app down and try to sign in again nothing happens.then by the time I've turned my phone off and turned it back on the app says that I've logged into many times and my account is locked. so I do the same thing with my husband's social. And the exact same thing happens. What's the point of the app if it just locks me out when I try to use it?",
      "This app is trash, I've been checking it daily since the end of January and it continues to tell me the same the \"information does not match, please re enter your information.\" I know I'm putting the correct information in but still gives me the same result every day.",
      "It worked great last year. I was able to use it one time this year now i have an incorrect information message when i put in the same info as i did the first time... Not sure how that works. 😒 waste of time and space. Fix it my rating may go up but this is unacceptable. And for all of the people calling people stupid, can you explain why it worked once and now wont work at all? I didnt start checking until the first of February, more than 24 hours after i filed and im having issues. Soooo???",
      "Hopefully this helps, i filled my taxes on the 29th of January. Every single day, i checked on here or Turbo Tax( the service i used to fill my taxes) they didn't have an estimate on how long until i had my return or this app said error or wrong info. Until i check my debit card with turbotax today. It had my full tax return. Maybe y'all have it and just don't know it yet.",
      "App does not work this year. Maybe it's the IRS bc they dont want to pay out, maybe it's just this app. Getting \"error\" or \"information does not match\", or \"no information at this time, wait 24 hours until your refund has been recieved\", which was last week. This app worked fine last year. Even the \"wheres my refund\" on google is not helpful this year."

      "I am a founder of stash. I joined as soon as I researched this new app and it's potential. Now after using it for over a year I can honestly say this is a GREAT tool for building wealth and saving is never a bad thing. This app walks you through step by step and educates you as you go. It also allows you to purchase fractional shares, offers great stockback and cashback promos. One acct for every financial need for a low fee. Very user friendly and good for beginners or pros. It's a win win!",
      "Frequency of direct deposit pop ups, uncertainty of at what price stock will be bought, and long transfer time make this app very frustrating. And this is just the average experience, what happened to me is insane: Soon after opening by debit account and depositing $500, Stash inexplicably blocked it. For 2 weeks I've been requesting support to have the account unlocked and get my money back. After uploading all the additional files they requested, including ID and bank statements, they answered I should call Green Dot Corporation. In the call they said this block comes from Loss prevention so there is nothing they can do. If I want my money back, I can try contacting my bank from where the funds came and request canceling that transaction. I never though something like this could be possible. All I wanted was to try investing with this app and now I'm spending all this time trying to get my money back.",
      "Awesome app. Great for beginners wanting to learn about investing as well as seasoned vets. Their FB page group is one of the most respectful and helpful bunch of ppl I've met online thus far. The only reason I didn't rate five stars is there are still some small glitches myself and others are experiencing from time to time. So there is a little room for improvement, but these are minor compared to the extensive and expansive options this app offer's, along with a strong support FB group.",
      "DON'T GET STASH!! They locked my already-existing account months ago for no reason. Made me jump through hoops to unlock it (uploading docs). The upload page didn't work. Support is awful; once they hung up on me. I was told to email the docs. I did. Nothing. When I call, they say they need more docs or more time to review them. (Why?) I just sent my ss card and they're saying the res is bad, but higher res won't email. Excuses! I still have no access to my portfolio at all and no recourse.",
      "I do like the round up features and simplicity of everything. Really can't stand the hard push for the debit card and other ads though. Also, it's a paid service, but there's ads.., does that make sense? If you want to learn about investing and plug extra cash into investments on a small scale to start, then this is a decent app. *With some brokerages not charging fees Stash gets kinda expensive in comparison if you fancy yourself serious.*"

      "It does everything I need except it won't allow screen shots for \"security policy\" reasons. This prevents having proof of scheduled payments or terms of an agreement when making a payment commitment. Means I have to type confirmation numbers etc instead of taking a picture of the final screen. It's just a picture of the agreement! - NO security or account data is shown. Should be MY choice not Wells Fargo's. And no explanation is available. I'm forced to research other banks online banking now.",
      "It's a problem when I'm in the middle of using the app and it then says that my session has expired even though I haven't left it alone for even 10 seconds. It's also annoying that when I login to the app it says \"Welcome back, here's when you last logged in\" and I then have to tap to get to my account. My previous bank app after login would take me straight to my account to see my balance, I sometimes just need to know my balance and don't have the time to wait for it to load an extra screen.",
      "My experience was absolutely AAA rating. The young lady explained how to deposit my check by taking a photo of it which I've never done before & I'm a 63 year old lady and always come into the bank to deposit my check. I don't put it thru the ATM because I don't trust it, but because of coronavirus I am on quarantine & my daughter tried to deposit it thru the ATM and it wouldn't accept. Because I need my money but I did not want to go against my quarantine she helped me tremendously. Thx's 👍",
      "This app is so frustrating trying to find information. You cant even get customer service using this app. I tried finding my routing number on my app cause i wasn't home so i had to call customer service just for that information. You guys need to make your app more user friendly and have more information so that we don't have to waste our time and your employees time with the small things like a routing number.",

      "Changes to the budget/spending is horrible. Where once there were more categories to track spending, now there are fewer. This section is very confusing. Before, I could view the transactions under each category and each category amount were totaled. Now, the changes made have only created confusion, frustration and now lacks the information I need to access in a simple, concise way. Please return to the previous version of Spending/Budget. This one stinks",
      "Great app. I use it a lot, especially for depositing checks. However I noticed a bug introduced not too long ago. When depositing a check, right after I take a photo of the check, there is a pretty high chance that the app will either restart or going back to login screen again. I am not 100% sure if this has anything to do with the automatic orientation change as I am using a phone (Samsung S5 with OS 6.0.1)",
      "It's nice to have, keeps me updated on my accounts is not pushy like other apps, was and still some time difficult to figure out, the AI does help but is limited on the assistance available it has improved since I first started using the app. Thank you BfA Update: The app has improved quite a bit since the last time I posted a comment. The AI is better with the assistance. It's still some learning but easier then in the past.",
      "Very frustrated with this app. Was charged multiple return check fees because my new bank account number wasn't correctly recorded one time. Tried to fix via phone, made the correction and resubmitted payment and was assured my information was updated online. Then, received a late fee, again. When I requested it be removed, was informed that \"the systems aren't linked.\" Despite being told multiple times that my information would be updated and that I wouldn't be charged a fee again.",
      "Great app but still can correct a major flaw. The issue has been ongoing and I'm surprised it hasn't been addressed since it's a serious one. Notifications of withdrawals, deposits, etc, are coming in two hours after the fact. I have done everything to try to correct it but it still persists. Two of my friends that also have the app are experiencing the flaw. This isn't good in the event your account is tampered with. I have a credit one app that notifies me as soon as card is used."

      "I absolutely love banking with Chase through their mobile app. The nearest Chase bank is about 223 miles away, so I bank completely online. It was a hassle at first finding what ATMs I could use. Currently with the job I have, I deposit my check through their mobile app. Within minutes or possibly an hour, the check may be available for bills or personal use. I can not guarantee that someone would have the same experience I did, yet I enjoy banking with chase.",
      "This makes so much easier than calling and checking acct over the phone. And to send funds to my partner using zelle. So much easier. But difficult to get back in using another device. But eventually was able to get back into my account. And getting the alerts an notifications right on my phone. And esp. Not able to go to the nearest bank for assistants.",
      "App doesn't send money and shuts down!!🤬😡 Don't know what you've done with the latest update however when I try to send that money the app automatically closes. If I try to transfer money the app closes. this app used to work beautifully I have uninstalled / reinstalled and I'm still getting the same issues. If I need to send money I simply cannot do it. I have to wait until I get home to my computer to send money which sucks. It's not as reliable as a fuse to be",
      "The app is good and resourceful. My suggestion to the developers is work on the sign-in section for multiple sign-in accounts. Currently, it is time consuming. It would not allow you to use biometrics for more than one account. Maybe check other apps that do well here, such as Instagram and Capital One.",
      "It's been a great app, but recently the rewards, credit journey, even feedback pages do not load. The screen remains white. I tried clearing cache, deleting data, but it didn't work. I then tried deleting and reinstalling the app, it worked once, but now it is back to a blank white screen. Please fix your app! And please don't tell me to send a secure message by logging into the site. This is an app problem, period."

So most people who have Android phones already have a Google smelt so it's really easy to send or receive money. Also there aren't any weird fees where they take a percentage of your money like most of these apps.",

Now the only thing I wish is that paying friends through Google Pay was easier cause it literally took me 30 mins to figure out how to. And I still am not fully grasp on the idea. But otherwise, AWESOME!",
      "Thanks for adding an option for loyalty cards storage. Could you please add editable fields for the cards like Notes or something where you would be able to save PIN-codes and other info about your cards (yes, sometimes loyalty cards have PINs). Also most cards look the same (except for well-known global brands like Adidas). Hope they will have the desing of physical ones in the future. Or at least add an option to change colors.",
      "Yes it works, I can use it to pay. But its security system doesn't work. I have tried multiple times to setup a pin/password/fingerprint security and it never worked. So does it work? I guess so. But does it work as a secure payment system/tool? No, it's a big fat NOOOO!",
      "Great app when it's working. I have 2 different cards set up in my Google pay app, both are contactless cards. Without any sort of logic, they both disappear from my profile after a couple of days and I have to go through the whole process of adding them and setting up contactless payments. Very inconvenient when you try to make a payment and when you get your phone to the terminal a message shows up \"set up contactless\""

      "I've been using it from over an year and it's the most user-friendly app available right now for money transfer and gives the best conversion rate most of the time. The best part is that I've been getting instant transfers from the last 5 months without an extra fee for which you get charged on other similar apps. It has become my go to app for the transfers. Love it!!",
      "It seems like there's always a problem. It either says that my address doesn't match or it wants me to enter another card. Calling \"C.S.\" doesn't help. I don't like waiting for 45 minutes to an hour for someone who doesn't speak clear English. I'm very tired of WU garbage. It's time to look for a better way to send cash. I guess my friend and her family can go without rice/food until the quarantine is over. That's only a month. Thanks Western Union you really suck!!!",
      "I found international transfers difficult and confusing at first. But now, having established regular friendships and having their info in this app? It is so easy to send them funds, and easy for them to pick up...And with the World in crisis now? I am so glad I can help them. Every little bit helps!!",
      "This app says that you can have money sent to your bank account and offered a promo code. But, the app itself did not have recieving money as an option not did it have transferring money to your bank account an option either. Also, when I wanted to put in verification to pick up money, it kept saying there were \"Technical issues. Try again later \".",
      "The app is exceptional I have never had a problem with it and if I have any questions customer support is always there for meI highly recommend it to anyone that is going to send money anywhere in the US or overseas the only thing that I don't like about it is when they make that long speech about getting ripped off other than that it's a great app"

They do ask that you put back at least $1 for what they call a rainy day fund which is withdrawn from your account attached monthly as well. I have not however used the Gold feature of the app, which actually asks that you expend more money to interact with that and I don't need that feature anyway.",

      "Im so upset. I tryed this app thinking it was lime dave and it is really not! They charge you right from the start. They wont let you get to the main menu untill you pay. They take money from your real account and put it into their own account. So they can take my money and are all in my bank and i cant get out of it or cancle it in anyway. I feel like i just got scammed and now they wont answer me.. Someone please help me."

I suggest that if you're going to have their insurance coverage you use the app. Save-A-Lot on paperwork saves a lot of hassle for the customer service people. And if you have to use customer service it's no big deal they're some of the most amazing people on Earth anyways.",
      "The EASIEST app for all of your insurance needs! I had to make a claim a few months ago and was able to do it completely through the app in minutes. Also I needed to postpone this weeks payment and literally had it done after 3 taps on the screen! Great job, Geico!",
      "I've had GEICO insurance for almost 30 years. I didn't switch to USAA after joining the military and I won't switch to any other insurer when I retire soon (Yay!). The reason is, no other insurer could give me full coverage including a rental if needed plus towing if needed for the same price or less, than GEICO. With GEICO I get more coverage for less money. Other insurers offered me less coverage for more money.",
      "This app stops responding more often than it actually returns any data when you click something. I'm often putting my phone down for it to lock before the app actually loads anything. Either it's an issue with the app or geicos api. Either way, nearly unusable.",
      "Old version was infinitely better. In this version there's no telling if what you click on will get you stuck in an endless loading loop. What are your developers doing? Did none of this show up in QA testing??"

This app is horrible and needs a lot of work...it may be better on computer but for a phone app it is ridiculous like for example the price/share is very inaccurate and takes forever to update, my limit orders NEVER get filled (had to use a market order in order to trade), and TD ameritrade offers 24/5 trading but I havent been able to trade in pre-marker...got no problem paying for trades as long as the app work",

      "Awful lagging app. It takes forever to update figures, keeps saying I don't have enough buying power when and I do, and my limit orders seem to just hang in the wind. Moreover, it processes order limits as a duplicate request, doubling the amount of shares you're ordering. Awful.",
      "App is generally stable and does what it's intended. Currently saved contingent trade is impossible to locate, among some other less important features. App desperately needs a dark theme.",
      "Huge improvement since I last wrote a review 3 months ago. The dashboard is a huge plus and works smoothly compared to the initial release in November. If you run into issues, just uninstall and reinstall it but remember to save your WL to the servers. One major issue is when I place an order, it takes 5-30 seconds for the order to show up in the position tab so I can't update it in a fast moving market. I had to switch to thinkorswim app to update my order as it's faster. Already sent this bug"

      "Great banking experience, No overdrafts. I get paid 2 days earlier than my coworkers. Their an FDIC bank. Easy online site to navigate. The downside is their isn't a way to get a new card without calling. And they have a $9.95 monthly fee. Which I can live with, since their is no overdrafts. All my coworkers are changing their direct deposit now too.",
      "The app claims to have 24/7 live chat support. I've tried to connect to live support many times at all different hours only to get the \"not available at this time\" message every single time. I used auto fill to sign up, they effed up my address. The app won't let me correct it. Green dot claims you can do a mobile check deposit, but the app won't let me. Perhaps if I could connect to live chat these issues could be resolved. Oh well. Totally worthless app.",
      "I keep getting an error after I log in & do the verification code that's says, “You need to login to your account to check balance!” Which is extremely frustrating because I can't use my card online because of this. I would not recommend this card to anyone. The fees are ridiculous & they lie. To check my balance at an atm, I have to pay 50 cents, which is bullsh*t, it didn't say anything about that!!!",
      "Great, reliable, intuitive. I love the option to make deposits with no transaction fee, simply using a bar code at select locations. Evidently this so cutting-edge that some cashiers don't know how to do it yet, and a manager had to come figure it out. Walmart is the only company I know of that can deposit not only cash, but also from another debit card. You can keep your account locked in your device, but set the app to key you guess your balance without signing in, for quick access.",
      "Bloody awful. You cannot talk to a live person, so don't expect any customer support. Further, the chat feature on the app never works. I bought a card two weeks ago, and I can't even load it. This company is dealing with UOUR money, and they have zero customer support. It is surreal. They never fail to take their monthly fees though."

      "Their support team is the worst. I'm a registered user for many months and have had to go through the verification process countless times because, although the app and website say I am fully verified, they apparently messed something up and I'm not, for some weird reason. They don't solve it, they simply stop responding... I've sent multiple tickets and they respond once or twice with pre-written stuff and then just ignore you. Very, very disappointed.",
      "I dont know why but for some reason the app will just flash but closes. I have no idea why? I have tried everything from unistalling to clearing cache, and force stop etc. This has never happened before. I called customer service and they said that it has too do with the API on coinbase but thay didn't work, so when i tried contacting them the person got mad, and asked me for my email 5 times, and my phone number over and over. Still not fixed when my wife downloaded the app she had no issues?",
      "Even after multiple attempts I never got the sms to confirm signup. They now have an email address, a phone number and a password. If I now move on to another wallet someone there might use that data to take over the new wallet I use. Not saying this will definitely happen but that is now possible where before it wasn't. Obviously I'll use another password but we all know some people won't. They deal with people's money and can't even get security right? Dangerous app. Stay away!",
      "Update: you advertise all sorts of free money if you sign up and learn about the different currency's. However, most are ended. And those still going out you on a wait list that can take years. How is this not false advertising? App works well enough. However, coinbase fees are high and it takes way to long to process a transaction. As in days!!! I am unable to do any trading due to pending transaction.",
      "The app is sub par and they have absolutely horrible support. I have opened three separate tickets with their support staff and my issue isn't even fixed yet. Every time I opened a new ticket they gave me some blanket response that does NOT resolve my issue. Then they close the ticket without checking if my issue was resolved. The worst experience I have had with any crypto company by far. If you aren't on coinbase pro they couldn't care less."

      "Uni stalling because it never works. The past month every time I try to log on it tells me I need to reset my password. Go through the whole process only to get the \"temporarily delays\" message trying to change my pass. Not even going to bother with this app until it gets fixed. I literally can't use the app so no need to keep it on my phone",
      "Terrible app. Continue to receive (temporary delays) message on my Android mobile device. Will not let me log in. A reputable financial institution such as Citibank should have their act together. I have deleted the app and will consider other Banks for my finances should this problem not be resolved soon. This has been an ongoing issue. Have spoken with customer service and was told they are aware of the situation yet nothing has been done about it.",
      "When I first downloaded the app, I had a terrible time trying to log in. And the automated customer service hot line was not helpful at all. However, once I was contacted by Citi's actual customer service people, my issues were solved promptly, and the app has performed flawlessly ever since. Many handy features, I highly recommend.",
      "Still not logging in. For a major bank to have such an underwhelming, buggy, limited functionality app, that speaks volumes. I can't remember the last time this fingerprint log in worked. Frequently even typing the password doesn't work, frequently it forgets that it logged in from my device 5 min ago and needs to send a text. Frequently it gets stuck on the log on screen forever. Standard reply, send us an email.. I have a flagship Samsung device, latest OS and app updates. No excuse!",
      "App isn't bad when it works, unfortunately that's only about once a year. Most of the time the app won't let you sign in with error messages like \"Having trouble? Try again.\" and \"Temporary Delays.\" There's not much choice in managing Citi credit cards, just don't depend on this app to give you any access/information - especially when you need it."

      "Unfortunately you can't use this to trade in Canada, but this is the most well-made app I've ever used for anything. It's the best way to view stocks. It literally has everything. Super, smooth, clean and looks really good especially dark mode. You can name and create your own watch lists, swipe between them, and follow everything super fast.",
      "Overall app is great for charts across globe. Haven't had a real-time trading experience yet. I would like to suggest in fundamental data, kindly include current imp ratios like - debt to equity (D/E), Price to Sales (P/S), EV to EBITDA, Cash Flow per share, Free cash flow, Price to cash flow ratio, and imp growth rations. Including above mentioned ratios can really help traders, investors in taking informed decisions. Thanks for great app.",
      "This is a fantastic intermediate level trading platform. From a technical analyst style of trading, both the desktop version and app allow for user friendly drawing of trend channels, fibonacci tracements, and a plethora of chart indicators. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fantastic trading platform. This just about has it all, an online chat community, paper trading, margin trading, short selling, options trading, and news relating specifically to the ticker all organized fantastically",
      "This app is a joke. I signed up almost a month ago, somehow it took 2 weeks to process my first deposit, then it bounced back had to pay a fee and fund even more to cover the fee. After $75 later and my deposits finally cleared I was hoping it was the end of it. When I went to place a trade somehow my account still has restrictions. I've tried to contact customer support but everytime I message I get an auto-reply. Horrible experience so far, YouTubers getting pay to promote looks like",
      "Perfect mobile trading app.....almost. The user interface is very well thought out, and quite frankly puts many desktop platforms to shame. The downside is their level 2 premium subscription doesn't appear to show the true level 2 quotes, most of the time, when compared in real time to competitor level 2 quotes."

      "It's easy to use. They're a little behind but definitely improving consistently. But there's a few features that I'm not 100% in love with. Like the payment stuff. Only saving one bank account to make payments. And it's slow to make them. I do like it overall, though. Definitely have experienced way worse. And anything they lack here has been made up with on the phone customer service in my experiences. Thanks, guys!",
      "I had to uninstall this several times, I have nothing but problems with this app it used to work until my last update. I don't remember what date that was but I haven't used this app for several months now,I install it again and it's telling me my password or username is incorrect, I can use it online and everything is correct, but the app won't work. with this coronavirus scare tactic I am not able to get in touch with anyone by phone it's long wait times. 🤔🤷",
      "Thank goodness for apps such as these that make payments easy! Credit One is the only company who took a chance on me, due to my not having any credit history except hospital bills that are illegally on my report (I'm disputing them) because they've been on there over a decade and should've been removed from my report years ago. Now, I pay each full balance of my credit card off before the minimum payment is even due just to show CO they took a chance on the right person!! Thank you Credit One!",
      "I really like using the app more so than logging onto site via computer, laptop, etc. It makes it a lot easier for me, because I suffer from some serious PTSD, which @ times gets my anxiety ratcheted up for no logical reason 😔😔. It's also great to be able to get notifications of statements so I can schedule my payments way in advance because with FMS &PTSD, my brain no longer has some serious issues with time and not realizing how much time has passed. 👍👍 for this app AND company!! ♥️♥️",
      "The app always gives you an error message stating that i do not have internet service even on wifi. Other apps work on my phone as well as rhe internet. Customer service was a waste of time. 2 hour phone call for nothing...the outsourced customer service reps are the worst. They are very unhelpful and rude. The only way to get anything done is to get a rep in the U.S. otherwise it will be a frustrating experiance. Save time amd frustration and get a card with another financial institution."

      "App worked great when I could actually log in. Problem is that I have to enter my VIP token, a separate app, and when I switch back from the VIP app, my user name and password disappear. So no copying and pasting. And since the token expires after 30 seconds (vs 60 like every other token) , there is not enough time for me to reenter the information before it expires. Hence the app is now quite useless.",
      "Nothing but problems right now!!! Everytime I launch the App I get an error message that states none of my data loaded. I cannot see any of my account, can do nothing! Obviously other users are having the same issue. I cannot understand how a major financial company like E*Trade cannot keep there app running. Super frustrating!",
      "Its not user-friendly. The app is complicated and busy and it looks designed by someone in finance. Being someone that doesn't trade a lot at all and kinda just messing around. I downloaded a couple of the apps and was extremely disappointed by this one when some of the others offer very well put together designs with next to no difference in fees.",
      "This app is beyond broken. It crashes every time you open the \"Help\" menu, it takes almost two weeks for money to transfer from yoyr bank account to the trading account, what money you do transfer over will randomly disappear, and the layout of the app itself is beyond inept, which requires needing to use the \"Help\" menu, thus causing the cycle of frustration to begin anew. Nothing makes sense, and if you are a first-time investor like myself I would absolutely NOT recommend. 0/10",
      "5 stars if one tech issue is resolved. App offers every mobile tool an investor needs for a live account. However, error notifications are displayed for any Watch List that has a cash balance. I like to configure stock watch lists with a dedicated cash purchase amount. The app will not display these accounts which defeats the whole purpose."

      "So far things are working fairly well with app. Although I find it strange that since I am using the app often,I have been receiving calls from robo-messeges stating my ssn is being \"suspended \" due to suspicious activity and to call a specific number. I call the number and usually receive a voice recording telling me that the mailbox is full and to try again later. If this is true at all, wouldn't it be posted in all this glorious information that you provide to me?",
      "I highly recommend this app. It's not only free, but more importantly, a great educational tool to teach you how to use credit wisely as well as improve your own credit score. And now offering even more updated financial advice to help you wisely get through the Covid-19 pandemic. Love all the new features! Bravo Credit Sesame! 😊",
      "One of the most reliable Apps you could find out there. Compared to other apps that provide similar services, I wished Credit Sesame could keep track of score updates on a more timely fashion. Other than that, it is reliable, and provides best tips towards a healthy credit score.",
      "Quickly showed me my credit score, and negative mark against that I didn't know of. Quickly matched me to banks that I had the best odds of being approved for line of credit to start building my score again. It's been fast and painless. Great job!",
      "Credit Sesame is very good it helps you put your credit back into place. I have told all my friends and I hope they start checking their credit scores that is why I gave you a 5 stars you guys are awesome."

Hopefully I won't need roadside assistance soon, but this is good to know. Thanks. Original review: App is getting better/easier to use but one big improvement that could be made to roadside assistance would be to allow the option of typing in an address rather than tap the destination on a map. If I break down in an unfamiliar city and need a tow to a place where I've never been, it might be difficult to locate the destination on a map.",
      "App is almost as bad as there service. No feature works properly. Doesnt save anything correctly. The features they choose to implement wouldn't be that helpful even if they worked properly. Not to mention there service is abhorrent and actively tries to screw you out of what you paid for.",

Supposed to help prevent overdrafts, but only if you're gonna overdraft within eleven days of payday, and if you overdraft before then, it considers you a 'risky investment' and won't even loan you $20 so I've been able to use it once and apparently that's all she wrote because it's only good for the end of the month. if you get paid monthly instead of bi weekly you're basically screwed. Edit: now it's only $5 instead of $20....",
      "It's nice and all that a quick $50 or $100 shows up when you need it. Like when your gas tank is too close to low and too far from payday, or you racked up a high dinner bill, that money shows up pretty quick. It also let's you know that you are too risky or broke so restricts the amount. I appreciate that the most since other payday loans will just rob you.",
      "During this time of unstability you can't get an advance is crazy. A rule is if your card expires in 2 or 3 months you can't get an advance which is crazy because the banks don't send out cards months in advance. So now we're stuck for the next 2 months. But good app. Has helped me last until a payday if i need it. Much easier to use then other apps like it. Much more giving to people that get money any many different ways unlike other apps being strict with their acceptance of certain incomes.",
      "Only complaint I have is that once you automatically pay back what you owe you have to wait until the next business day before you can use it again. Definitely not a reason to not use by any means as you can have a negative balance and they will still deposit in your account. I've used other payday services like branch and moneylion, and they all let you take money out the same day you pay back. Overall I give 5 out of 5 though and am currently on the waiting list for the $100 advance.",
      "it was nice to get the cash advance right away after signing up, but I felt a little bit like I was tricked into leaving a tip, which I didn't feel comfortable doing yet the first time around, especially because the whole reason I got the app was since money has been tight. By default 15% tip was selected, and then hitting the thank-you button submitted my choices tipping that amountand there was no obvious way to select no tip. I think what you have to do is actually just close the application"

      "Pretty Good for online Banking. My only issue with Varo is the fact that if you lose your card, your only option is to wait until you get a new one in the the mail which can take up to 14 business day, before you can access your money. Over the counter Cash withdrawal are available at 3rd party vendors/ Banks, but you must have or card.. Which brings me to the point above. Varo savings do offer pretty high yielding APR's on its customers.. Which is cool, , LOANS, loans I say is what I want.",
      "To me this app is very convenient because I never have to go to a bank, I didn't need any money to open the account, It was very simple to set up and it has already helped me get a credit card. My freinds find this hard to believe but its true. I plan on using this app alot.",
      "Best bank I've ever used. Period. I was reluctant to get this because I'd been getting F'd in the A by ridiculous fees from Wells Fargo for years, and didnt want that again. My employers convinced me to go with a bank for efficiency. So I gave this a shot. Not only is it by far the simplest easiest to use bank ive ever encountered, it doesnt buttrape you with fees EVER, and it gets the job done. This app is a breath of fresh air for anyone who's struggled with predatory banks in the past like me",
      "No fees so far, very easy to navigate and transfer money to other accounts!",
      "This is a great way to get paid earlier and as of right now I have not had any issues. I like the fact you can save your change with the round up feature of the debit card. This is one of the easiest to use banking apps I have seen if you a tired of bug banks keeping your money for 2 days on your paycheck deposit to make money from the interest then you need to switch I did and I love it."

However, now its either website are slow or you have to wait 5 days before transaction will be completed.. If its going to be like this , might as well use western union or other money remitance If I have to wait that long!",
      "Be careful and make sure your not over paying. No longer using this app unless of an emergency. They keep about 800 pesos after charging me a 5 dollars for fee. 800 pesos is about 40 dollars at the time. So they try to fool costumers thinking it was inexpensive. But at the end of the day they are taking a 45 dollar fee. Very expensive. Other than that for me the app was very easy to use and very handy.",
      "Very slow - a simple 100 EUR transfer from PayPal balance within SEPA took 3 working days to complete. The process feels dated, competing services provide ID verification to speed up transfers setup and often complete transactions within the same day. Fees and exchange rates do not stand out either.",
      "Useless system. They allow you to start a transaction, deduct the funds from your account and then make demands for documents to prove that you actually have the funds in your account before they authorize your transaction. Wasted over 12 hours trying to send money but eventually had to cancel because of their illogical demands. Avoid at all cost."

      "I have been with Netspend for 4 years. And for the most part been happy. But I gave 1 star due to my experience today. I got a bigger sized credit from a refund we got and all of a sudden I can't use my card or my account. Then we try to call it says the info we put in is wrong so we can't even talk to anyone. App and online pulls up and everything looks fine. This is a nightmare. All the money I have is in that account and I can't touch it. Thanks a lot! Hope ya'll get it fixed soon!",
      "Its a great app. Especially if use the flash pay . money is sent from one card to another instantly no charge but only to other cards whose bank that NetSpend supports. This card has saved me numerous times when I needed money transferred immediately to me. Customer service was excellent handling an issue with monthly fees",
      "I have to at least like this app since I use their prepaid card, but the \"Mobile Check Load\" is horrible. It's problem is that it's Autocapture doesn't capture at all. It complains that it's too dark to take a picture. Despite using a dark background, and trying to keep the phone still, and trying to find a light or nonshade to use to brighten the check, I usually have to manually take the picture. Why can't I manually take the picture to begin with? I could before the last update. Trying to use it today, I had to manually take the picture 13 times to get it accepted at all. Look, if I could afford Hollywood lighting to take a picture of a check, I probably wouldn't need a prepaid card, right? Ingo Money Inc. is very bad.",
      "I have been with netspend for almost 3 years but most recently I can't sign into the mobile app no matter what I do I have had the same username and password forever!!! It's really frustrating and disappointing at times... other then this recent issue it's great!! Hope netspend fixes this ASAP!!!!",
      "Just like other preload Visa's that can be used internationally. Except that sites will suddenly stop accepting and you gotta buy another one. They charge $1.50 a transaction unless u shell out $10 a month. They also have maintenance fees. I don't recommend unless no other choice. If u use with any frequency I'm sure your getting gouged in the long run."

      "Just horrible. I had this app and I was trying to cancel my subscription and it doesnt even let me. I know others have this issue as well. It says I need to withdraw all my later money before unsubscribing and it doesnt let me withdraw because I have less than 5 on my account. I had this issue for over months now and it just keeps billing me every month $2. I didnt take it seriously but those 2 dollars add up. On top of that I never made a cent of a gain and I just lost. Horrible app",
      "I love this app and everything it could be. Let Acorns invest for you from one of several different strategy profiles. My only issue with this app currently is the UI is a little complicated. It feels like running around a messy room. Finding a specific place can be a huge run around. This app is a must if you want to invest but not be bogged down with having to complicated financial strategy.",
      "I use Acorns as my main checking account. Infinitely better than the bank I had before (Chase). I like that it immediately subtracts spent funds from your account so you don't end up in the negative when a transaction takes a while to go through. You can choose how aggressive you want your investment portfolio to be and how much you want your round ups to be. Anytime I've had to call them, they answer almost immediately and support is knowledgeable and helpful. I definitely recommend them.",
      "The only thing thus far I don't like is the now 3 dollar a month subscription. It was 1 dollar at first now it's 3 dollars. I didn't request for the increase. This may affect my decision to stay ... Also there's no option to change your bank at will, you have to contact someone to detach your account but not to enter it, this is suspect to me. If this does not change. I'm gone. Thank you for the opportunity ...",
      "They won't let me link my debt card. I have notified them several times. They say it is my fault because of an old version. So I unloaded and reloaded the app. I was told to do it off of my computer, and that didn't work. It is just too bad they do not have a good enough tech team to fix problems. They were supposed to give me $5.00 for each person I got to sign up. That didn't happen and I was there when my friends signed up. Closing my account has become extremely hard. I have emailed acorn!!"

      "This is my first use for this app and so far came through with flying colors! I usually read reviews to assess a company, I came across some very negative ones about this company and was wary about using but I took a chance. Customer service and speed was great! I was using two well known services but dropped them! The \"invasive\" questions was for my protection which was okay with me due to the many scams. I needed to send a relative funds right away and they came through! For now 5 stars!",
      "Excellent service and the best app to send money. Been using for almost 2 years now. I've tried a couple others, but always come back to Remitly. They finally added ACH and debit cards to receive money. Best customer service. Chat is often available and the reps are always helpful. I can basically manage my own transactions; cancel etc on my own. Rates are a little delayed and the Android widget doesn't have an option for different update increments. As close to perfect as it can be.",
      "USER BEWARE! Transfers stay in limbo for days, every time you call their help desk they ask you more private, personal information, and even though they make you stay on the line for over 2 hours and supposedly have cleared your transfer, next day it still hasn't made it through. Now even their phones are down! This app should be reported as a scam",
      "I read the positive reviews after getting a bad experience with other sending apps. I am happy with the service money reflected same time and it is easy to use and it let's you know on the status of the transaction. I will delete all the apps for sending money and use Remitly only! ❤",
      "For the main reason that it was developed and provided by anyone or possibly an Indian or Pakistani, this will never be safe to have. Good luck on having your money taken or mistakenly overcharge. I wish you all the best of luck and will never use this app again. Use a tracert program and you'll be able to find out where it goes."

The 0% aligns with the top of the solid bar and the bottom of the hollow bar. It should be the other way around. Please fix it asap. It is nuisance.",

Update 3/20/20 updated today, all better, fast, seems as good as it was a while ago....thanks",
      "It's a battery hog. That needs to be fixed. There should be options for lower battery consumption mode. Not everyone needs stock updates every 100 milliseconds when app is running in the background. I am following up for the third time. When is this issue going to be fixed? Why should an app consume 25% battery in 4 minutes of use with background disabled? You have a lot of teams and hoops and loops... but this is insane. Let these go directly to the concerned person and fire the middleman.",

      "Works great, in all honesty, I'm glad I'm able to contact loved ones inside prison. I've encountered no issues with being able to contact them, or get a reply. Only thing that I could say would need improvement, is the time it takes to verify a safe message, but that doesnt come directly from the app, so I won't remove a star for that :)",
      "All of a sudden it doesn't work anymore. I was logged out for some unknown reason then I logged back in and it makes me set it up all over again then when it gets to the part where I add the innate it says hes already added thennn there is no other option. If you hit back it logs you right back out. Thennn when you restart the app it just stays on the loading screen. Thennnn when you uninstall then re install it, it is the same damn process all over again...",
      "This app used to work. Now, after the 20.1 update, it does not work. Trying to roll back to an earlier version also does not work. The usual troubleshooting does not work. This is a jpay server issue. Uninstalling and reinstalling does not fix, calling customer service does not fix. Guess their IT guy went on vacation or something. I'm expecting to get a cut and paste response to this rather than actual results, but we'll see.",
      "My original rating was 3 stars because the email function isn't working properly. The app developer responded suggesting I call an 800 number or email support. I did both. During my call the agent explained that the email function didn't work because I needed to purchase stamps, so I purchased stamps.JPay still will not let me send an email. Same problem as before. The field does not auto fill with the recipient name as it should. Please help.",
      "I am barely receiving any emails at all until a few days after they are sent & absolutely nothing at all during the weekends. Even if the facility flagged one or more of my emails I seriously doubt the system would be lagging as bad as it is. Something is seriously wrong with the overall speed of this app. Perhaps your IT department should run some type of diagnostic test to determine the overall issues. I pay money(my money that I earn) to buy stamps in order to send emails to my Loved One."

There used to be, but they are gone. The only notification setting is for trades. This problem has persisted since Version update 3.40. Recent update to 3.46 did not fix. Telephone calls and emails have not resulted in a fix.",
      "My phone just upgraded to Android 10. Once it's upgraded, this app cannot start any more. I uninstalled and reinstalled again. It worked for once in the beginning, and then when launch next time it stopped on the first screen. And freeze there. It seems cannot start anymore. It worked perfectly fine with Android 9 but not after upgrade. I am a heavy user of the app, and need it fixed asap. Thanks.",
      "The mobile app is not user friendly. I would like quick easy snapshots of investments. Desperately needs easier method if making and adding watchlist! I'd like to see my stocks and watch list's current, last open/close rates easily all together in one easy to see page. And why in the world are the watchlist from the website NOT SUPPORTED ON THE APP!?",
      "Until a recent update in March, which happened right around the market crash, the app was working great. Now, I can not set any of my feed settings. I have set all of the parameters to show nothing, yet nothing changes. I have certain markets I was watching but decided I didn't want to see them every day, and I can't get rid of them now. Very frustrating. It WAS a great app. Now it take more of my time than I prefer.",
      "Great app. I liked it better with the news and market stuff on the front page above account summary. Lot more colorful and interesting. Would be great if it showed daily info for 401k shares too. They seem to have pre loaded pages it fetches based on how good or bad the market is doing, and it seems to change throughout the week for reasons unknown. It can be a pain in the ass and frustrating because it's always changing where I have to look for the info im looking for."

It won't let me log in giving \"technical difficulties\" error message, or \"temporarily unavailable, and that they are working on it\". I know my log in is correct, but neither system let's me in. It must be a server problem... DEVELOPER, THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED!!! THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FROM DISCOVER CARD.",
      "It was working fine and then there are errors. I waited for the error to be fixed but it still doesn't take my payments and I couldn't message help on the app. And I am currently abroad now. Also, I changed my password twice and I still cant login to get in my credit card account like I normally did before;I have to reset and reverify over.. If this not get fixed, I may have to consider canceling Discover.",
      "Doscover is just always there through any crisis. This card is really the only card I feel safe using. The representatives are always courteous, helpful and they want to make sure the company is working for their customers. I have been with Discover since 1974. I hope I never have to eat and swallow these words, but I really trust Discover Card.",
      "Terrible, I just want to check my statements and this app takes forever to login with fingerprint every single time. When connected to high speed wifi it takes long enough, about 30+ long seconds, but when cell service drops to 3 bars of 4G or less forget about it, won't even load. Funny, Capital One app doesn't have this issue at all lol. Fix this issue and I'll fix my review to be better too."

      "So, I've been an advocate for Current since I had heard good things about its features. However, when you lose access to logging in because of a phone number change?? makes you glad that you only put in $40… but I kinda need my money that I saved for a rainy day (hmm maybe 'pandemic' day)?? Now my app is trying to make me apply for a new card… Get your coder tested. I think they're sick!!",
      "First of all the only thing I have liked about this card is my check was deposited early. The fact that I did not want the premium account and wanted to read the fine print about it, because I hit the button and signed up for the 4.99 a month. Then you deactivate the old card before I received a new one is just ludicrous to me. Next, I go to transfer my funds from the account and the system is down. Let's just say you have lost a customer. I immediately stopped my check from being deposited.",
      "They can get better. Need to fix current to current pay sometimes doesn't work you gotta send an email and wait like 7 days for a reply. And they need to stop putting accounts under review for over 6 days while holding your money is ridiculous. Also the chat team is not very skill. You ask them a simple question and they answer like a robot. 3 out of 5 times they don't understand or don't care what you're going through.",
      "My Current card is excellent. My direct deposit arrived in 4 days. I am also excited about how my new current Card has an option button to either continue to keep the card \"active\" or to turn off the \"active\" function, when your current Card has been lost or stolen and perhaps compromised. I highly recommend the current Card to those wanting a more saver and secure card. I give the Max rating of \"All Stars\" to the creator of the current app & card.",
      "I created an account. Waited the time and received my card. Between those i got a new phone and number. Still have the same email. It's been at least two weeks that current has said my account is under review. Well, current now you're under review and it's not looking good. I'm not so sure i want an account with you anymore. The customer service is terrible. After two emails to you about this nothing has been done."

      "I've used them for years. For the most part everything works fine. However, when things don't go well there is no mechanism for contacting customer support other than sending an email...which may or may not be answered in a timely manner. It is frustrating to lose access to your wallet and then not be able to reach them for any help. It makes me very uncomfortable to use them for anything other than very small transactions.",
      "Great wallet. Simple and easy to use. Fantastic customer support. Replied straight away to my email and fixed my problem. Very happy",
      "I have sent money to my BRD account and it hasn't shown up yet! I have no idea where it went.",
      "Love it. And a nice and safe way to send money anywhere in th world.",
      "After days of jumping through all your hoops, sending down all your documents, seven full days later, my deposit was finally approved...now, it seems to be stuck there. I can't move it to a merchant. There's no hotline for help, and it takes you hours to respond to my emails. I received no concrete help with steps to fix the problem. You guys have been no help at all. Really disappointed."

      "Update, March 2020: The app has become unusable. I mostly use it to deposit checks and every time I try to photograph a check it photographs the front over and over and over. Then after 4 or 5 times the app crashes and reboots. For the past 2 weeks it was similar but not as bad. It would photograph the front numerous times and then finally let me photograph the back. But in between there I had to dismiss a bunch of warning screens. It took about 15 minutes to deposit each check.",
      "EDIT: I had to reduce my rating due to a bug. The check-scanning software asks for a front photo twice, then, instead of prompting for the back photo, exits, but puts the last photo taken of the two in both spots. This was very confusing. Fortunately I was still able to complete my deposit by tapping the back-of-check button and similarly taking two pictures. - The app works pretty well, with the features you'd expect like mobile check deposit, external payments etc. Good on ya guys.",
      "The requirement to provide & verify my cell number to receive a verification code which needs to be inputted each and EVERY time I log into the app is a serious pain in the ass. I do not use the app because of this. Well, tried the app again 3 months later, still requires my device to be verified with an additional code via text every time I log in, even after inputing my password and selecting the \"remember me\" option. Deleted once again.",
      "Loaded it fine. Sign in took several tries. Depositing a check is too hard. 3 photos of each side! I don't know if I made 1 or 3 deposits. Signs me out after a couple of minutes of non-activity (how is it non-activity if I'm trying to deposit a check), not 5 like it claims. I'll try to work with it, but it's rough.",
      "I just downloaded this app and have tried to deposit a check. After I choose the account to deposit to & enter the amount, I can't find a way to take the picture of the check. I have tried calling the bank numerous times for help and always get a 15 or 30 minute wait. Gave up till later I guess. I am one of the high risk seniors with COPD/not supposed to get out. I am going to delete app and download again. PLEASE HELP!"

Anytime i have had an issue with a transaction, they fixed it immediately. I always recommend this card over all other pre paid cards. Its easy to use online also. If you cant understand it then you may need to use a rush card or something.",
      "It doesn't work! Update: I have uninstalled and reinstalled this app a number of times on my cell phone and it still won't accept my user name and password! I've tried everything I can think of and can't get it to work! It appears I'm the only one having this issue so there would be no reason so it to be updated or fixed! Very frustrating that I can't check my balance when I'm away from my laptop!",
      "Have very few problems with this card. I've read the other reviews, most are user error. Not the card. I've had it over 2 years. I dont have my apps on auto update so I have to go in an update myself. If I wait to long Walmart Card will send me an email just to remind me. I use the lock feature all the time, and live it. Only issue I've had is poor internet will make the app fail to load properly or not allow for me to unlock my money. And again this is not the app's fault that the internet where I am is slow or down.",
      "I have had this app for years, and an account even longer. All of a sudden recently I moved and called the bank to have them update my info. The next one time I tried to use the app after that, it started making me verify by sending a code that my email or phone number. Well I the bank never updated my phone number, and the app is not sending the code to my email. I have yet to speak to a supervisor or anyone that could help. I'm changing to Chime. Hire ppl that can be understood on the phone.",
      "The in app 24/7 chat support never works. Always looks like it's connecting then say sorry unavailable try again later. I've been trying since I downloaded the app and it still hasn't worked. Also the P2P isn't working on my end. I'm able to send money, but never receive it. Customer service hasn't been able to help with this either. I'm gonna go back to my regular greendot card which worked better and with no problems."

    "description":"The Self credit app (formerly known as Self Lender) is a way to build credit history while you save*. Build credit with Self, even if you have a low credit score (or no credit score!)\r\n\r\nOver 500,000 people have used Self’s Credit Builder Account to build credit and save more than $300 million. With the Self Visa® Secured Credit Card, you have even more opportunities to build credit after you get started.\r\n\r\nHow does it work? Think of it as a plan that builds credit while you save, starting at $25** per month.\r\n\r\n1. Apply for a Credit Builder Account. Your money is safe and secure in a bank account.***\r\n2. Pay off your Credit Builder Account in 12-24 months.** You can choose the payment term and dollar amount that best fits your budget.\r\n3. Each on-time monthly payment builds credit history and adds to your savings*. Your monthly payments are reported to all three credit bureaus while the principal gets saved in a bank account.***\r\n4. Unlock your savings. Once you’ve paid off your Credit Builder Account, your money unlocks and comes back to you (minus fees and interest).\r\n\r\nBUILD CREDIT. SAVE MONEY*\r\nWith an active Credit Builder Account, your payments are reported to all three credit bureaus.\r\n \r\nCREDIT SCORE MONITORING INCLUDED****\r\nWith the Self credit app, you can check your credit score at no cost. The mobile credit tracker!\r\n \r\nNO HARD CREDIT PULL\r\nSelf does not do a “hard pull” credit check when you create an account. In fact, no credit score is required at all!\r\n \r\nSECURE ACCOUNTS\r\nAll accounts use two-factor authentication, 256-bit encryption, and fraud detection to protect your money and private information.\r\n \r\nUNLOCK THE SELF VISA® SECURED CREDIT CARD\r\nHave an active Credit Builder Account in good standing, make at least 3 credit builder account monthly payments in full and have $100 or more in savings progress and you could unlock access to a secured credit card – no extra deposit and no hard credit check needed.\r\n \r\nWHY PEOPLE LOVE SELF\r\n“Love love love this program and this app! In eight months my credit went up a hundred and nine points Super happy and can't wait to renew once the first year is up” - customer Debbie G. Individual results may vary.\r\n \r\nFeatured on ABC News, USA Today, Newsweek, TechCrunch and NerdWallet\r\n \r\nTERMS\r\nWhen you download and use Self, you agree to the Terms of Service at: https://www.self.inc/terms-of-service\r\n\r\nPRIVACY POLICY\r\nYou may review Self’s privacy policy at: https://www.self.inc/privacy-policy\r\n \r\n*Savings are minus fees and interest. Results are not guaranteed. Improvement in your credit score is dependent on your specific situation and financial behavior. Failure to make monthly minimum payments by the payment due date each month may result in delinquent payment reporting to credit bureaus which may negatively impact your credit score. This product will not remove negative credit history from your credit report.\r\n \r\n**Sample products are $25 monthly loan payment at a $520 loan amount with a $9 administration fee, 24 month term and 15.92% Annual Percentage Rate; $150 monthly loan payment at a $1663 loan amount with a $9 administration fee, 12 month term and 15.91% Annual Percentage Rate.

      "Awesome app. Definitely helps that stupid loophole of \" to have good credit, you have to have credit already in order to build credit\". This app and many others alike help young people like me get started on building credit out of nothing. Very happy with it. The credit card though, is there anyway to increase the credit without paying off the balance just yet? The whole point is keep paying over the year or two to build said credit, but a higher credit limit would be nice.",
      "This is the most amazing app ever for anyone who needs to build/rebuild their credit. I had filled ch. 7 bankruptcy and been discharged about a year ago now. Needless to say, my credit was looking rough. Now, after 2 months of payments, credit is up 136 points! I don't know how it works, but it works and that's all I care about. Amazing service being provided here with equal opportunities for all.",
      "Since I was already working on my credit prior to getting the CD (Dec 19) and CC (Feb 20) thru them, I can't say for sure which did what or anything at all but my credit has gone up at the minimum 50 points already! But the app is very useful and user friendly. Has an answer for pretty much everything I had a question regarding. I have the $150 12 month loan!",
      "My credit went up a couple points after opening account. The thing that i do not like is the daily withdrawls that come out if my account. It is only pennies daily but after a year this will add up. I am sure it is some kind of interest or fees. I will finish off the term of the loan and will most likely be done with it but anything can happen. I have only had this account for two months. So a little early to tell",
      "Excellent service. I was skeptical as there are a lot of \"fake\" or misleading services that exploit people with no/low or bad credit, especially of lower incomes. If used responsibly, this WILL build your credit, and build a bit of savings that can be used to also get a secured VISA credit card that compliments the main account. It WILL hurt your credit if payments are missed, etc... but if you are trying to build/fix your credit but are on a fixed or lower income it's still manageable $25/mo."

If you can't manage the small business owner with one phone user story, maybe the constant request for phone setup isn't a feature. Maybe the error message could be less vague.",

Next time, do not tell me it's my fault and that there have been no complaints when so many of the reviews state otherwise. - - - - - I have loved this app in the past.

I wish I could use Zelle alone. 2 years on Zelle and never had a problem. One DAY fooling around with PNC and I can't get anything done.",

I do not recommend.",
      "I thought the app would be great to shave money off my insurance as I only drive to and from work. I just don't see how this will work when not all my trips get recorded, or it only records a mile of a 18-mile trip. This app is very faulty and, now I'm not able to use the app at all. The beacon refuses to pair accurately with the app. I am on the 3rd beacon in as many weeks. This is ridiculous. I really despise Drive Safe and Save. This app has been extremely annoying and severely unreliable.",
      "The way that this app registers phone usage is fundamentally flawed, and the devs will just copy and paste a generic response to every review that is pointing out this issue. The detection of being \"movement and screen on\" captures false positives for a plethora of different situations. It's silly to implement a half-baked feature like this. I get dinged for every trip when using my phone once I've PARKED AT MY DESTINATION. It's silly that your algorithm doesn't remove these.",

Shows erratic driving while in construction zones. Said I was speeding I am about ready to say the hell with my discount and send it back. I turn the bluetooth off and the app keeps telling me it cant record my trip when I am sitting at home. The damn thing beeps all damn night. I uninstalled and reinstalled several times.",

I was always been 96% and 99% for the first 6 months I had the app, and now I am sitting at 91%, and it feels like I'm getting points taken off on like half my trips. I used to be able to go a week or more and 20+ trips without losing any points."

The watchlist section loads very quickly, easy to navigate, very straight forward to set up multiple watchlists. Top grades for this app. I also use it with tabldt and phone, all synched. Thanks!",
      "All the news you get is great, you just cant share. Changed to s10+ from s8 and the complete action screen has usless choices no texting just email, continue on pc, bluetooth. Had Verizon look in my phone and found they couldn't do anything about it. That it must be the app not the interface of the phone which they suspected at first.... update..still nothing. Have reset the phone & reinstalled the app Nobody interested in communicating. Just there proprietary news I guess or they would fix it",
      "I do not like the home page what so ever. The website gives you news every 5 mins and on the app, it does not relay the same news. The same articles will come 30 mins or even an hour or more after. Please fix this and I'll give a better rating. It needs to be as good as/better than the website.",
      "Excellent app that is easy to use. Even a novice, like myself, can easily be guided to set up a watchlist. The app has good clarity, provides lastest news & gives you the ability to watch \"on the go\" literally. This is my \"go-to\" app first thing on a weekday morning to check important market news that would relate to any investing.",
      "Very easy to use. I use this App to track my stocks in multiple watchlists, and track the markets and the futures. Also, the news. As a new user, I am sure I am not using all the advanced features. But, I am hoping to get there soon. Thanks."

Unless this is resolved I will not be able to use this app as much as I would like to be able to. I have seen it work on a friend's phone without issues, not sure why I (like many others here) am unable to log in.",
      "This app is very simple and intuitive in its format but many things are full of glitches and it is very limited in what it offers. I cannot figure out how to transfer my funds to a different bank account. I have a prepaid card for plasma donation at Grifols and they used to use Wirecard before they switched to BoA. I preferred Wirecard infinitely more.",
      "Be PATIENT! The \"fingerprint\" login WORKS just fine. When you get the \"fingerprint recognized\" message - if you wait just a moment - you will be rewarded with your account balance and other click-able settings & information. Believe me, please... The biometric login WORKS!",
      "App works as it should. Quick to update transactions. The only downfall (which isn't a huge deal) is the fingerprint access doesn't work. I set it up, it recognizes fingerprint, but when I go to log in the next time it doesn't work. All my other banking apps have no issue.",
      "Worst banking app. From day one months ago I made a account. Have never been able to log in. Ive try many of times to reset password never ever ever has it emailed me any type of link with a code to do so. Never. Huge pain in the ass have to call every time. And at the least why cant i just send a txt to see balance so i dont have to even bother with the app."

      "Best CC app I've ever used. And I would recommend Capital One/CreditWise to anyone trying to rebuild their credit. Don't fall for others charging annual fees. It will hurt you in the long run when you inevitably cancel the card. Who wants to pay annual fees in perpetuity? That's how the others make their money on the backs of people with bad credit, sometimes thru no fault of their own. GL.",
      "Let's me know if my email address was found on the dark web, so I changed my password and installed additional authentication to be able to access my email, as well as additional security on other personal items. It also alerts me when inquiries are made, and new accounts opened. This is 100 times better than just checking your credit once or twice a year. You are alerted, you can check for accuracy to make sure you- not someone inquired/opened the account so you take appropriate actions.",
      "I like this app because it shows all my credit reports and updates every 7 days which I think is very great in my book. Also, it tells me what I can do to improve my credit score even more. I just wish that I can pay all my bills at once and then my credit score will be going up the roof😂😉 Anyway, when I get a more secure job I will pay more amounts but definitely when I pay off Capital One off, I will go back to them! Keep up the good work!",
      "Making payments is simple. It alerts me of any impact to my credit score and who and what is making the impact. This app also gives updates on your credit score, tells you when the next credit score update will take place, and gives you stats on areas that impact your credit good or bad. Informs you of ways to improve in areas that are not execellent. I log in with my fingerprint so I've not been having any log in issues like the others have mentioned in their reviews.",
      "Love the app, it's easy to use and understand. But I would like if there could be more details. Like dates of past inquiries, what company opened the inquires, things like this. Like credit karma."

      "I have been using QuickBooks for a year now, it is ok , you can follow your expenses and have all organised when the app is working properly. In my case, recently the transaction function does not record all data from my bank for the last month , is the second time this happens. Also they make it so difficult to get human help , I have to spend half an hour goin through the AI questions to get the help I need. Not really reliable when you have to check expenses continuously.",
      "If you get a new phone you start from ZERO . Unlike other receipt keepers. That's super problematic and makes this make all effectively useless. Glad I changed phones earlier in the year rather than later when I may have had months of receipts to try to categorize. Pass on this app until it figures out a way to be able to transfer business rules, receipt saving and etc across multiple phones for a single email/account",
      "Today my phone (android) has installed the latest update as promissed. Problem is... it has changed all my \"milleage\" tab km to miles on my phone. ALL my logged km have automagically converted to miles eventhough it still shows in km. I cannot even, with some certainty, tell if the conversion is even accurately due to not having a back up log. What's going on with you guys?",
      "I would not suggest this paid app. If I could get my money back I would. The software kept increasing my expected tax payments every time I modified transactions to the point that my expected payment was 3 times my actual income. Pretty poor functionality for the most fundamental of purposes for this app.",
      "Update 3/10/2020 Wish I could get a refund. Customer service is non existent. The assistance they claim to provide me is the same as my last complaint. App is currently not accepting mileage updates when I select personal or business. App still shows wrong bank account information. They still deposit funds into the wrong account and have zero ways of changing the default account, or at least they've not provided me a means to change accounts. They also like to bombard you with TurboTax spam."

Some of the locations I've been to ask for ID which I understand but I've had a few places not letting me add cash money to my card maybe because it was above 500 dollars but then again I guess it depends on the place some locations are more knowledgeable than others I guess.",
      "I'm not one to complain but I did my return Feb 23rd, my return said I got it March 11th but I never received the card. I try accessing my account but you need the card to even login. I want to talk to a specialist but I've been on the phone for 40min. I want a direct contact to talk about my card and when it's coming in, not an automatic message.",
      "Have not recieved card with tax return yet it has been since february 11 when I filed Balance shows on card but still don't have the card Have been calling number to report missing and have yet to get anyone to answer phone and send it App is only good for use when you have card not still waiting for it to arrive Help!!!!!!!!! This wait to get someone to send card is deadly",
      "So I set everything up on the card after we got it. I was able to set up what I wanted and check my accounts etc. Today I try to get into my account, using the same info saved on my tablet to sign in. All of a sudden it is telling me we don't have an account. I go through resetting the log in info. It let me reset it but now it is telling me there is a problem with my log in info.....so I tried resetting the sign in stuff again thinking I might have messed up. No success. Will not use again.....",
      "I did my taxes on February 26th 2020 and it gave me the option of getting the turbo card and that it would arrive between 5-10 days and it is now march 11th 2020 and i still have not received my card and i was told i was supposed to have a temporary card information but i did not get it and i cant get to the money in my account and I have Bill's that I need to pay so I called them the lady was rude as hell and she told me that I would get my card faster at no cost but they still took the money."

      "I have had no problems with the driving test but weird how I did perfect on my test but my rate went up not down so I'm a bit skeptical and feel like a bait and switch is at hand . I'm not sure as to why the rate went up either . No explanation was offered that I could plainly see . But it maybe that i didn't look closely.",
      "Root has been absolutely awesome. I know that most of us are just looking for the cheapest monthly payment, and honestly this is it. If you're not a crappy driver, you're probably gonna save money with root. Besides that, the app is great, and they let you push payments back. What more could you want?",
      "Drains half the battery on a brand new s10+ This is totally unacceptable. The app CAN NOT tell the difference between you driving and being a passenger the GPS in your phone is only accurate to around 1-3 feet (huge discrepancy) with a metal roof over your head. I'll be cancelling soon, I spend more time worrying about this stupid app, yes even in the car, then I ever would have paying the little bit per month it saved me (less then 10$). Get it together your app is killing your business!",
      "Yes it is convenient and quick getting a quote, sign up and do everything through the app however even if you complete the 30-day test drive with a PERFECT 10/10 result, your rate will still go up anyway!! They claim it is still lower than most competitors which may be true. However, the initial discount offered is misleading and can never be actually achieved, no matter how safe you drive. Be aware!!",
      "App is great. I was excited initially and recommended Root to everyone I knew because I got such a great rate. Then 6 months later my policy is up for renewal, and my rate is literally going to DOUBLE, from $90 to over $180 a MONTH. Nothing has changed on my end, not my vehicle or driving record, I haven't gotten any tickets or had any accidents at all. They have no explanation. I have no idea what happened but I will be cancelling my policy with Root."

      "The Investing portion is good for long term investments, but delayed price updates make it bad for day trading. The bank account is pretty good with a lot of benefits, but the interest rate keeps dropping and is no longer one of them. The Relay product is somewhat lackluster but is always improving. Can't speak to their personal loans as they keep rejecting me. No student loans to refinance so no review on that either. All in all, I really like this company, just as long as it keeps improving.",
      "App is worse, have to re-login everytime I use the app. Swap to another app for 2 seconds? Login is required. Also, I still get the application being reviewed notification when I try to look at my account. I am able to get around it by going back to the main page, then back to the money section. But this has not been fixed since July (when I initially emailed Sofi about it) The mobile app is by far the worst thing about Sofi. Which sucks, because everything else about Sofi is great.",
      "The app refuses to remember my log in email address, despite checking the remember me checkbox. I guess the remember me check box only makes it so that the SMS code doesn't have to be entered again. In addition, there's no support for finger print authentication. This adds friction to getting into the app each time I go to use it.",
      "\"Get your Money Right\" slogan appeals to me as I have been struggling to budget for years! Right now I'm looking at the money management tools like their \"Vaults\" which reminds me of envelope system to save for specific goals in virtual fold which I like and I'm researching their stocks that pay dividends in the invest part of App but the most important feature that sold me is the free ATMs worldwide because I just got my passport and want explore!",
      "I love this app. I cash out one of my survey apps straight to it and the other to PayPal and cash PayPal out to my sofi card. The app keeps track of my credit score for free and makes me sign in Everytime I use it so noone else can get into it."

      "App is decent. Compared to the website it is really lacking. Provides very little information in comparison to it's website. Anyone who is thinking of using this app. Please use their website first then compare it to the app. The notifications are great, but if it's similar to the site it would be better",
      "I feel the data is a bit unorganized. I also get notifications for stories that do not appear when I click on the notification. Other than that, it's a pretty good app. I should be no more than two clicks away from any market. BigCharts should be implemented. Nobody can do a technical analysis of this market with a three-year time frame. Obviously, we should be able to set the range beyond 3 years.",
      "Frequently updated head lines. Many articles from other sources that you might need to have a subscription for, are available in full length on this app. Always worth taking a look at the beginning of the day if you are into markets and economic news.",
      "Could be a fantastic app if they'd not let their personal biases against Trump influence the way articles are written. Just report, don't use antagonistic tones and rhetoric which overshadows the financial and economic articles. This would be a five star app, but I can't justify it due to political biases againt Trump.",
      "Allows me to check topical as well as more in depth market specific news easily in on place. Also using My Watchlist allows me to monitor stocks and funds activity throughout the day as needed. Easy to navigate and use all parts of the app. Very easy and convenient."

I did receive an email, but it would take far too long to fill in the information on their support request than it's worth. Absolutely useless with terrible customer support.",
      "Took hours to get the email verification email. The app had a window asking for the verification code in that email. But by then, that window was long gone. No way to enter the code or reset the password or finish the account registration in any way. Do some basic testing before releasing an app. Not worth my time.",

      "Easy to use and so convenient! My kids love the personalized cards and the fact that keeping up with their money is so easy! Greenlight Gifts is also a great way to get your kids money for birthdays and holidays without having to worry about it getting lost before it can't ever be used. We love our Greenlight cards!!!!",
      "Horrible! You can't delete the old cards once you order a custom card, you have to call customer service and then they end up deleting the wrong card, then you're on the phone forever trying to get it all straightened out, which doesn't happen because they can't see the pictures on the cards to know which one to delete. You also have to call to update phone numbers, addresses, basically everything instead of just doing it on the app. I wish I had never gotten it.",
      "At first I was very unhappy with the app on my android (Samsung S7) it loaded slow and ran slow. However! I registered my complaint and the next thing I know I'm talking to some of their folks and damned if they didn't trace my problem, find the cause, and release an update to the play store that fixed my problem, all withing 48 hours! Very impressed with their ability to figure it out and correct it. App runs great now and so far I'm pleased with how the whole system works. This was the first time I've ever encountered a software issue that was actually acknowledged and fixed by a company.",
      "Overall, it's a great idea. BUT there is no indication anywhere on this app store that there are in-app purchases such as a $4.99/month membership. (The fee isn't the problem just the principle.) Unpleasant surprise. Then, as I understand it, my child needs a phone to use this. I'm not sure how I feel about all this, so I'll probably look elsewhere for a solution.",
      "Love Greenlight. I personally love all the security mechanisms. I did have to call when trying to add another funding source but it's for my security and customer service was efficient in assisting me. We have kids living in two households so it makes it so much easier to provide for them immediately if a need pops up. They are using the saving function, and learning to budget. I also love that the children's info is on the backside of the card, so no worry about strangers getting their name"

I kept going around and round fix delete fix delete! Then i went to help chat. Wait time 10 minutes , ok then app timed out kicked me out of spot inline, tried again sorry problem with live chat over and over again! Finally agreed to 49.99 then during checkout extra 45 for state so free means 94.95 u suck hr block!",
      "Easy to use with no hidden fees until the end like other tax apps, it discusses prices upfront and is completely free if you choose the right options unlike other apps that you click free and end up paying $150 when its all said and done. The app is very helpful and has answers for any question you may have on the spot instantly for you to access, plus they help you get every deduction possible. I highly reccomend this app to EVERYONE. Its definetly everything needed and more!",
      "This was the first time I filed my taxes by myself. I was really nervous. But they made it so easy. Plus they have extra services to make sure you didn't make a mistake or to protect you if you did make a mistake for pretty cheap. I'm really glad i got this app.",
      "Easy to use, my first filing myself and felt at ease. In some sections, I wish there were more options to file mileage and some other items. Other than that, my experience was great."

      "Fantastic. The platform gives me visibility into 15 different financial accounts at a quick glance. Really great tool to keep track of everything happening in your financial life. A few bugs once and a while but eventually the developers sort that out. I never experience any long-term issues with bugs or errors. Highly recommend for anyone looking to get a grasp on their financial life. Also, comes packed with budgeting tools if you are looking for that.",
      "I used Mint for a long time then it stopped syncing to my bank account in spite of numerous attempts to fix it. I'm sad that I will be looking for an alternative app if these problems continue much longer. Who has time to devote to figuring out the help system maze via Facebook or Twitter? Not me. I'm obviously not the only one experiencing this either.",
      "I like using the app so I can check my finances in real time. It works pretty well. Here are some things I'd like to be able to do. - rules carry-over from desktop version to app - ability to assign categories to pending transactions (otherwise, the app miscategorizes and we get a notification of over-spending) - modified: adding a new merchant is possible! Up'd my review to 4 stars.",
      "VERY useful 👍 but not customizable 👎 I can see where my money goes, I can link accounts (so I don't have to manually enter transactions), and there are lots of useful tools (budgets, spending trends/charts, 'hiding' transactions from spending trends for more accurate budgeting, bill tracker, credit score, etc). But I cannot: customize categories at all (adding new/editing existing), which also translates into not being able to customize budget items or rearrange the list of items in my budget.",
      "App used to be great. But it's been almost a year since it's worked well and the way it is supposed to. I have multiple accounts that it can't connect to or stay connected with, which leaves me with out bill and finance tracking or notifications. I have contacted customer service and chatted with them about this issue a few times and nothing has improved. Update for developer: This link is the same thing that all of the chats have gone over. There is something wrong one your end. Please fix!"

      "I've been using Schwab for 5 years now and have recommended it to many people. But lately, I'm getting frustrated with how inconvenient the mobile app for day traders. The account doesn't reflect what's been purchased today until after the market closes, no way to check the updated average, or new stocks etc. Because of how volatile the market is, I want to take advantage of it, but Schwab is holding me back. I'm looking at other options and going to switch soon.",
      "Interesting how it auto-logs me out everytime i want to view my positions on a day where the Dow is down 250 points. Edit 3/16. After failing to buy at a low price because the app crashed, this app has once again let me down. The app forcequits every time I attempt to view my positions or buy more stock. Absolute pathetic from such a large company. Don't trust them with your money!!!",
      "While setting up an account I hit the back button to change preferences and it made me start over. It did save the account since the username was no longer available for a new account but when trying to sign in it said access denied. I had no option to finish setting up the account or login so screw it, I downloaded a different app.",
      "Easy to use, easy to understand, cheap and reliable. I was confused the first few days using it when my account was restricted. Turns out they just needed to confirm my identity. Friendly and great customer service on the phone. And btw phone service is 24/7. Beginner investor and glad I'm using Charles schawb.",
      "This App use to be great... Now the charts disappear. One day you have all that's necessary to trade the stocks, and another day I find that I have only part of the stock charts- (that disappears on me) This is horribe when it happens right in the middle of my tradding. Right now I have to reinstall the C.S. App again and again, in order to have the App work for me. Hello?? This is getting old. Grr Tech. Please fix this problem."

      "Love the app and they fact they help build your credit and it has worked for me but I hate when anyone lies to me and this app is full of lies especially when they say you can pay off bigger chunks of a loan than the weekly fee (you can't btw) then they say pay off in full with a debit card instead of a bank account and it's instantly paid of which is a lie cause as soon as you press send it tells you 3-5 business days for payment to clear. If thats the case fine just don't lie",
      "Concept is great. However, execution is horrible. Fees are high and Customer Service is non-existent. Called the CS phone number during normal business hours. It resulted in being disconnected, as the automated response said the office was closed. Tried updating my address, twice and was once again disappointed. Fail.",
      "Customer Service is worthless but overall the app is good but in the same sense it's also bad. Won't let me add or update my credit/ debit card same card number just a different expiration date and security code. It says that the card has been added, but it never shows it. But other than that I'm somewhat satisfied with it. I wish they'd go back to the $1 a day login reward. Now I can't even switch banks, I wish you could just use a routing number and account number to add or setup a new bank.",
      "Extremely stupid app, with even stupider customer service. My bank account got hacked so I had to update it, and it's been several weeks now, and their lame customer service hasn't been able to do it. They literally can't update a f'ing bank account. This is their business! Bank accounts! At this point, I'm not so certain they're not the reason I got hacked in the first place. Edit2: I tried doing the phone call thing, and no one ever called me. Even that doesn't apparently work.",
      "Keep getting errors...says I need to link my bank for instacash but bank is linked...tried to sign up for credit builder and keep getting same msg that it's my internet...also everytime I try to connect my bank (although my bank is connected in my accounts) it knocks out the other connections to my other financial apps such as Dave and brigit...very strange...tried several times..always the same thing each time...guess it's a sign to stay away.."

The app does work for viewing banking and doing transfers and simple tasks you would expect, however when it comes to getting policy documents that's a whole other story.

It has some basic saving features, but its clear that whoever made this app didn't put much thought into it.

May I suggest you just add features to the app and maybe reprogram it? The issue so far is definitely not on my end, your reply didn't help either.",

Its a lot like my wife because it tries to control my money but when i touch it i get nothing. Needs lots of fixing. So does the app. Oh and one other thing. The sms doesnt tell me my remaining amount on my card after use. Another thing my wife and it has in common.",
      "Having nothing but problems. Can never log in to the app. The adp use to text me my balance and what was being use as soon as I used it. All I have had is problems with this new way. I also think if it continues to be like this I'll also go to direct deposit if I can't get into my app at all or get the texts like I use to.",
      "I liked it better when it was in the main ADP app. Not only did it take up less space in our overcrowded lives, but it also showed pending payments in a way that made sense and told us our remaining balance in the same text message as the one that alerts us to the card being used. Wisely doesn't do any of that. The other annoying thing about the company in general is the fact that they clearly don't view which areas use their product. There are 0 fee-free ATMs within about 300 miles.",
      "Literally can't log in. I had trouble with the adp solutions app as well. I thought this one looked nicer and would work better. But I click log in and nothing happens. I already signed up with card email and username... I'll change this review once the app actually works. I'm glad I activated texts or I would have to call my card to check the balance... EDIT: So I reinstalled and now I can log in. Keeping the previous text there to help anyone else app works and looks very nice"

      "Never again. Locked my account to verify funds on a check deposit. Why not do what every bank does and show the deposit as pending and unavailable until funds are verified. No, they prevent access to ALL the funds in the account. They'll also send emails telling me I have notifications and I should logon to view them. I can't login to view them because they blocked online and app access to the account, it's completely locked. Did they commissioned the Jr high swim team to start a bank w/ an app?",
      "Used to love it, now I cannot access the app or website via VPN as of late Feb 2020. I've also had issues with the mobile check deposit failing after having no issues for years. I frequently connect to unsecured networks at coffee shops, offices, etc, so no VPN support is a dealbreaker. If this continues I'll take my banking elsewhere.",
      "The trading app is absolutely riddled with bugs. Every time I blink I have to re-log my. It will log me out mid trade. The bid/ask prices are different depending on the screen you are on. On the trade screen, I will see two seperate tiles of the same stock, with different prices. If you lose connection for more than a few seconds, the app piles on errors that all stack. I have had to click ok on no less than 30 errors before I cleared them. Then it makes me re-log. Ally ruined the Tradeking app.",
      "On the snapshot the information that is supposed to be useful (lightbulb between total balance and individual account balances) is not. It is telling me I have transferred money. It says the amount and number of supposed transfers but that is it. I have not transferred any money recently and the lack of context on what transactions it thinks are transfers is quite annoying. I do not find this helpful at all how it is. Please fix things with 3rd party financial monitoring services too.",

You can go through all the steps necessary to make a trade and just before you push the buy button, please reenter your password.

It fails to open most of the time and when it finally does open, it will freeze for about 5 seconds and then a message will pop up saying the \"app has stopped working.\" I uninstalled and reinstalled the app plus restarted my phone, but the same issues with the app. Why update the app if it was working fine with no issues ??",
      "It would be a ZERO if I could. All of the sudden I can't access my account through the app when I need it most. The app was great until now. Absolute trash app if I cannot reach what I need when I need it and without explanation. Haven't seen my account in a week and counting. I'm quite certain that I will get some BS excuse for the failures of the app and \"assured\" it is \"being handled\". If the app being down all the time wasn't an issue beforehand, this review wouldn't be so bad. 3+ times/wk.",
      "This app crashes consistently and has repeatable instances of failure. Every time I need to deposit a check I have to reinstall the app. If I have the app remember this device I am unable to login again because the username text box is removed from the login screen. Making a payment to my credit card also crashes the app once I do reinstall and login. When handling money and debts it is frustrating knowing that an electronic interface is force closing itself in the middle of transactions.",

This is really the only reason I have the app. I notified the developers a long time ago and they pushed a new update without fixing it. The check deposit function saves me over an hour of driving to my nearest branch. Without it, I would be better off switching banks - which I don't want to do, but will if this isn't fixed."

Lastly, it always takes forever to pull up a stock when I type it into the search bar. Sometimes it just hangs there with the icon. These are some things that needs to be addressed",
      "TOS is great for giving you a lot of data. But the app does not make it easy to use, constantly has connection issues even though you have a good connection. It only allows for 1 attempt at getting your fingerprint correctly before then asking for your password which is extremely annoying. It should allow for at least 3 attempts prior to asking for passwords. When looking through home page, it is cumbersome to use. When going thru your positions and then clicking it, you then have to click the menu button and click \"view xxx details\" before being able to see the chart for that ticker. Switching between Paper money and live trading glitches the app and only putting the phone into airplane mode and then back fixes it.",
      "I thought it was just time for a new phone and maybe it still is but on my pixel 3a there's always a message that there's no network connection and it stays stuck like that for a while. But yet I'm still able to surf the web and log onto other apps that use the web. Only if I restart my phone or disconnect and reconnect to my wifi would it let me actually log in. I can't keep doing that especially in the market of today, 3/17/2020.",
      "Connectivity issues. I wasn't about to leave a review, but I decided I must when I saw dozens of similar complaints to my issue that have obviously gone unaddressed. I can't access this app, which itself cites connectivity problems when literally no other apps share this problem. My internet access is working fine. ToS, however, is leaving me out to dry.",
      "I have a solid signal. I can log in to my Schwab account, surf web using mobile fine. Try to log on using the app get message, no network connections detected. What a joke. The futures charts and quotes having major lag issues today is 12 March 2020 getting worse. Nothing but problems with this junk app. Solid internet connection can use multiple other apps and search, this app tells me no internet available. What a joke TOS!"

It always says that there was an error and if it was processed that I would receive an email. There is an extra word in my address on my profile. It won't let me edit my information. Also it doesn't let me know when I get a message. I have to go completely into the app messages to see if I have any messages.",

Now if I tap the app, onscreen is the message: Unfortunately Connect Network GTL has stopped. I can't get the app to open. I tried clearing its data and cache, but it has no improvement.The staff has tried to help me, but still did no good. It should be simple to operate!!!",
      "Will NOT ACCEPT my payment... Ever since I got a new debit card with the same account number different expiration date different CVC code it will not accept my payments. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. I have deleted payment options from the online account. Re-added saved payment methods. Still have to go online every time using a laptop. It's extremely inconvenient. And annoying. When will this be Fixed? Accept my payment amount from the internet browser no problem.",
      "There are occasional issues, adding funds has been the most recent issue. For awhile credits would disappear. If you use a pin/passcode to open app if your screen goes off for any reason like a call coming in it will erase whole messages when it should automatically be saved to drafts. I can not delete phone numbers I no longer use, I can not delete inmates off the messaging although I can block them but sometimes I do not feel blocking is necessary but have no need to see their names listed",
      "2/ 12/20The app has stopped letting me do deposit. It is very frustrating. But if it helps others if you log in online and not thru the app you can put money on the accounts that way. Still doesn't let me do the deposit on accounts. Only can do it online. This app is useless and needs to be reprogrammed. I would give 0 stars if possible. ** UPDATE- YOUR APP IS STILL NOT WORKING!! WOULD YOU PLEASE FIX IT!!! 0 STARS**"

      "Tried setting up an account. Gave them all my information and waited over a month for my transfer to be completed. In the end had to cancel my transfer because it looked like nothing would happen. Switched over to TransferWise. I got verified and already did my first transfer without any problems.",
      "I have been using this since last year and it was all good but it has been horrible now. My fiancee transferred money wallet to wallet,but after I withdrew on my wallet, it only says waiting authorization(even after 24hours).Went to the place for cash pickup but I was told,there was nothing in their system.After talking to W.R. support for more than 5times they all said they're having tech. difficulty and cant process OUR money! 2 days later, still having trouble??WHERE IS OUR MONEY??",
      "I made my first transaction about two weeks ago and have since made a couple more. For being able to send money internationally, I've not used a better app than this. I'm able to direct deposit or mobile cash or pickup. What I like most of all is the ability to track and that I'm also notified when the money is picked-up. My first transaction had a problem but they worked with me through it all. We corrected the error and completed the transaction. AWESOME SAUCE!!! Keep it up!!!",
      "Needs improvement. I had a problem with trying to pick up a transaction, made 4 trips to the place, emailed and called tech support a few times, and spoke with the local partner and could not get a resolution. Ended up cancelling the transaction and I didn't get a reply to my inquiry on the website. Probably won't use their service again if they don't reach out. Wasted my time and $$$",
      "I tried sending a simple mobile transfer from UK to GCash ewallet in Philippines. Offer described largely in many company online pages as something awesome. Online I did not even find the mobile sending option; I opened account in app: here not even Philippines or UK were in the country list! The help support was not available in chat; by email they sent me instructions just to resend the same inquiry - \"ask the sender\", when the enquiry email was from me, sender. I've time to fix scams. Follow."

      "A little tricky to get things set up properly. Needs work to streamline things. \"Lightning speed\" doesn't work with all banks (example: my bank placed a 3 day \"check hold\" on transactions through debit). Once setup is done though, it works really well. Pretty accurate daily logging and cash outs happen exactly when promised. Hands down, it's worlds better than taking out payday loans. If you're in a cycle of payday loan debt, do yourself a favor and try this app. (not a sponsored post).",
      "3/19/2020 - Just wanted to give an update. This app was working great....for a while. But earlier this month it just stopped working. Now I dont know whether it is on their end or something with my bank, but I find certain things funny and annoying. They keep raising my max - yet I cant even withdraw. They cant access my bank info -- but they will gladly take money out even without knowing my balance. This needs to be fixed soon because it is very frustrating. They will cause me to overdraw.",
      "It started off great! Then every pay period started experiencing Bank connectivity issue. I spoke to a number of reps about the situation and They keep giving me the same info about the app. I tried restarting it. Tried putting Bank info again. Nothing would allow me to connect. Im 5 days into the NEW pay period. Was able to Cash out once. Still havent gotten back to me about the problem. This app is great at time. But sucks alot more.",
      "It worked fine for two weeks. For the past 2 pay periods it keeps telling me my account is negative, I had to send screenshots of my deposits and balances and it still did not update. I entered and reentered my bank information at least 9 times, nothing. I tried to chat about it but kept getting the same generic response to choose my bank again and.... I'm waiting to see what happens before I uninstall. UPDATE: I decided to keep it, it really works!Keep doing what you're doing Earnin. 👍",
      "I think this is a great app that helps you out when you need the money after paying bills...however as a warning don't too excited and cash out too much when your max goes up. Just like anything else a budget must be in place, otherwise when they debit your paycheck you may think to yourself \"ouch\". Its a wonderful app, just be responsible"

      "Ok, but when I say find nearest church it can't find my church when I'm sitting in the pew. Also, it would be nice to remember my church from week to week rather than having to search all over again for it. The app seems to assume I'm more likely to give to a new church every week.",
      "Very handy. Sadly, I had not paid tithes faithfully since I got direct deposit years ago. This app single-handedly got me back on track. I would give five stars if you could EDIT a recurring payment. However, you just have to delete and redo as of summer 2019. Also, I wish I could schedule a future payment.",
      "My wife set up an account, it was great for the first time. I had to switch bank account information, forgot my password, it sent a reset link, but when I reset my password, all my info was gone. It told me I had to set up a new account. As I input the info asked for, I realized it wanted me to set up a church for others to give to. That was June 1, 2019, it's the 11th, tried again. Went to my church, I asked for help..they were stumped as well. So I have erased the app. will use checks now.",
      "This app works fine but touch ID feature, doesn't work on Android, or at least, not my pixel 3a...",
      "Wöw!!! What An Awesome App.. Tithe.ly has changed my world when it comes to giving at church. I don't like caring cash... I don't have to worry about filling out a tithe envelope, look for an ink pen nor lick the envelope any more...It's as easy as 123. Once your home church has established Tithe.ly account for the church, You can too ENJOY the Modern Day Technique in GIVING! We Have Gotten to Keep Up With The Times..   The only thing I had to do was download the app, follow the prompts, & pick the church of my choice that I wanted to give to. So Upon pay day, I Simply, Tap the Tithe App. This also Encourage me to pay Tithes before I Accidently see something I want instead of I Need... 🤔😉 Soooo, All in saying to get my tithe out of the way before the temptation of shopping or etc. I can now pay my  tithes from my car, home or etc.  It also sends your confirmation to your email as well as keep all money you have paid accountable for. I've been paying Through Tithe.ly over 6 Months & It's been a PLEASURE!!! HALLELUJAH!!! God Has Answered Another One of My Prayers.. An Exceptional Way of Given."

      "Personalized Debit Card options are by far the best I have ever used . Each deposit , cash upload and all my transactions are instantly updated , and there are plenty of upload and deposit locations in my area. However .... The $10 Monthly maintnence fee is way to extreme for a pre-paid card. Also... The Instant Check Deposit feature has not worked one time for me , I have tried 3 different checks in which they all were on different days as well. I rate this pre-paid debit card a 8 out of 10.",
      "It's a good card to use with kids teaching how to budget and understandings of living within your means. With the fees you are paying every time you touch it. The moment you pull it out your wallet=fee, just thinking about an online purchase=it fee, actual purchase swipe =fee, calling for balance=fee. Using this card will definitely help you get a real bank account that's not in the face mugging you. Banks fees are tact on by overdrafts not.",
      "I LOVE this card!! I have several others but mainly use this one!! And the card has SO MANY dif picture options that are AWESOME!! I LOVE WOLVES & I swear, there are between 12,18, 24 or MORE wolf pics to have on your card!! And I've never had ANY issues using my card whether I'm using it on-line, in store or on phone!! You WILL LOVE all the options you have!! I know I do!!",
      "Perfect way to get your paycheck a couple days early with direct deposit (no $9.95 fee if you direct deposit $1000.00 or more a month) , transfer money from your bank account , you can take a picture of a check in the App to add it to your account balance , you can receive multiple cards , I have mine added to my G pay account to pay with my phone or smart watch ( make sure your phone or watch is NFC capable in the settings menu of your device ). Install the App and check out the many options!!!",
      "Just started using this and next month I'll be having direct deposit and using this more. Looking forward on using my card and getting my money two days sooner . I know I'll like it more and can't wait to start using it. I also do a lot of online shopping so this will help me too."

      "I'm impressed, I didn't expect to qualify and did immediately despite having a low credit score which I'm trying to improve thanks to Possible. My only minor complaint is the 4 payment option is really 2 because 2 of the payments are scheduled for the same day. Still one of if not the best loan apps available. Helps in a pinch and builds credit, thus far I'm absolutely satisfied. Great customer service too. Thanks for the opportunity!",
      "Thank you! Amazing app that makes me feel confident using. I was sick with longterm illness so my credit took a hit with medical bills & drop in income for few years. My wife has been trying to help get it up a bit & this app is definitely a Plus for both building credit & helping out when in a tight spot. To top it off? I found out the headquarters is in my state. Awesomely Awesome! Credit score is climbing!",
      "Beware. Seems good to have access to borrow money with a reasonable bad credit interest rate. Unfortunately, when you have an issue they don't have a working customer service number and only email you back. The emails are somewhat generic; which happens often when you aren't talking directly to someone. I've wanted to pay off my defaulted loan for months now. I get emails telling me to do so in app and the suggestions aren't working.Don't deal with any company that doesn't have a customer serv#",
      "It was great for awhile. Then when i decided to switch banks and made sure they put my new account as the primary payment account. But then they still pulled out from my old account again!! Causing my old bank account to go -$300! Ive reached out but now im left paying that back for their mistakes. Its a great app for building credit but just becareful.",
      "I had issues with the app sending the money after the loan was approved. I emailed over the course of several days but didnt hear anything except the automated email. After I left a negative review, the issue was addressed same day. Other then that experience Im very happy with possible finance."

      "Once I have gotten set up, it appears that the app is working fine. But, my God, the process of getting to that point was an absolute nightmare. In fact, it took me three days of trying and constantly having to endure the app crashing. Plus, everytime I got a message stating that my bank account was set up, it made me go through the process five more times! It would appear that the app was launched prematurely, without ensuring the product is fully operative. Am I correct? Be honest, please.",
      "Update: Finally was able to receive advance Update: After submitting a ticket now my issue I my deposits. (Funny) My payday can no longer be detected. (Wow) My account was finally verified. I meet all the requirements except one. My debit card does not meet the requirements. Which not true. I use my card at least 5 times a day. How much activity do I need?",
      "At first this App was great. I took out a loan like 2 times. The first time it only allowed me to take out $25. I payed it back on time, and then the next time I went to take out a loan it allowed me to take out $50. I payed back on time, but now it's only giving me the option to take out a loan for $25. This makes no since. Why would I be allowed to take out $50 pay back on time, them lower my amount to $25… I'm very upset because I really needed to take out $50 to buy some grocery's especially",
      "I started using Branch three or four weeks ago and it has yet to let me down at all whatsoever a single time. It's been very convenient and satisfying to receive the amount that I qualify for an order to get a Pay advance to begin with. It's been on point every single week and I love this app!! 💯",
      "Total crock of steaming BS!! I was placed o the waitlist for the debit card, and continued to use the cash advance service provided. Last time i received a cash advance was two weeks ago. When i reveived the debit card, i activated it, and set up direct deposit for my payroll. Now i am being told that my account has been locked due to \"suspicious activity\" when there has been no activity with my card since it was received, and it's going to take up to three business days for them to fix . . ."

      "GREAT APP!!! I Actually read the reviews and was skeptical about downloading and wasting my time, but i downloaded it anyway and registered on the app, added my card info, and just like that it works great!!! It gives current balance and transaction history.. Just so you guys know, you have to create a new user ID and password, i think that's where people are going wrong 😘",
      "The poorest excuse for an app i've seen in my life. Continually losing my info, username wrong, password wrong, losses my account nnumber. The page to enter the card number is missing the next or enter button completely. Customer service is nonexistent. A 1 is way to high a rating! Spent over a month trying to get in, hundreds of hrs, hundreds of attempts. Should be pulled as an available app..",
      "This app is HORRIBLE as far as trying to log in. I am being forced every couple of weeks to change my password, even though I opt to use my fingerprint to log in. It happens even though I log in regularly and is not only completely FRUSTRATING, but just as UNNECESSARY and TIME CONSUMING. There's no way to get an itemization on purchased goods, just lump sum amounts. Honestly, the entire app is horrible. The help center is even more worthless. You can't even contact anyone if you have questions.",
      "Edit: Jan 4 2020, still have to create an account to just check the balance. Manager: Hey what's the best part of our app? App dev: Being able to simply check a balance. Manager: How about we have people create accounts, so we can track transactions, then sell the info to advertisers. Too much info needed from user for simple balance. Stops just shy of dna testing, maybe next update. Gotta mail off a spit swab and wait two months for the balance.",
      "Who do I contact. Been using the same password for month's never no problems, but today when I login there's a problem and my account gets locked. The link that was sent isn't even working."

      "This app is decent but unfortunately lacks basic functionality such as the ability to filter receipts based on date, merchant, or category and the ability to search for a receipt based on different parameters. Unlimited smart scanning is $5 per month. Just wish I could get my $5 back. Plenty of other much better apps out there for this.",
      "We have had employees use the app and so far there's no complaints!!! The reason for the neutral rating is due to the expensify cards they push on you. We have been testing them in the last week with confusing and negative results. Just tried to reach out to concierge but have ended that conversation being more confused. We will stay with Expensify but we will be searching for a different provider to replace the cards.",
      "Overall a pretty good app, small UI improvements would go a very long way, keeping this app from 5 stars. For example I had no password and just a Gmail login and it and that is not an option on the mobile login page. Also, some pages are too big to fit in the screen and you have to scroll down to see status text (with no indication that this text exists) such as connecting your bank account.",
      "Just hate this app. Not easy to use and I end up not claiming half of my expenses because I know I have to spend tons of time with it. (A trip overseas is easily 1.5hrs of work with the app). Things were 100 times easier when you could just dump your receipts at accountancy...",
      "This app is the best of all apps and so easy to use. It's made it so much easier for tracking costs. It's a real burst time saver, AND it's not an arduous tasks that everyone dreads. I'm not sure how it will go as expense records with Australia tax returns, but I sure hope it's ok to use as an official record. Sure there's some bug's and some ways to make manual receipt entry easier. eg. Many receipts are emails pdf files or actually within an email txt. So a pdf receipt would be good."

      "App crashes a lot or just won't allow me to sign in. Has caused my payment to be late once now because of not being able to get into the app, not because I didn't know my information, but because the app was having problems. Freezes when trying to sign in, especially with finger print varification. This seems to be a customer wide issue that need to be fixed.",
      "Love the app because I do everything on my phone. When I need to use this app, however, it seldom opens. It will eventually open, but I have to try over and over until it does. Normally takes about 6 or 7 tries resulting in 30 minutes of continuous frustration before I can use this. If they can ever get this fixed, I'll update to 5 stars, but until then it just angers me for the 1st half hour because i have to waist so much time in attempts before actually using.",
      "The app is honestly the worst app I have ever used. It freezes up everytime I try to login - That's if I can even get past a blank white screen - and when I attempt to close out it freezes my entire phone (it's a S10+, so it's not the phone). It's actual garbage and if I could give it zero stars, I would.",
      "This app used to work really well. Not perfect, but decent. Then it started freezing and hanging up during log in a while back. Now, it won't let you log in at all. Use the website if you need to access your account, cause this app won't work 🤷‍♂️",
      "Update.. Still a great easy to use app!! However using this card you should be aware how your payment is applied.. Tried to pay off 70$ deferred balance that ends April 2020 and was told that it would cost 118$ to pay it off because the first 48$ I pay a month is applied to another deferred balance that has pay off date for November 2021 then anything over the 48$ is applied to the 70$ balance so 118$ is required to pay off a 70$ balance before interest is applied"

      "I had no problems using this app for some time and was up to 110 bucks that was tremendous to use lately with my hubs out of work. Sign on tonight to see that my amount to borrow has changed to 50 for no reason. I have still got the same income and have paid back without any issue whatsoever. In reality, the 110 was less than I should have been allowed to borrow given my income is min 900 weekly after taxes, but 50 dollars is barely a gas tank. I really need this fixed.",
      "Update number 6. 8 months later. March 15th, 2020 Update:: After being told it was being added shortly back in December it still hasn't. Do not use this crappy app. There's so many better alternatives. and after successfully adding my account it still says that the app doesn't support that bank. If it takes them this long and they still don't know what you're talking about this app isn't worth it. Go to earnin.",
      "My husbands review-> Has been great. Never had any issues. Would've been 5 stars until now... Have been getting 180-200 for months... Until this last pay period, they offered to add my debit card to receive my deposits in seconds which really didn't matter but i went ahead and did it. MISTAKE... As SOON as i did, they reduced my advance from 200 to 60!! I've never missed a payment and follows the rules. For 60 bucks and the 9.99 fee, i probably will not continue to use this service...",
      "It is easy to activate the safety net, and I like that it automatically comes out on my next payday. I guess it would be considered a payday loan but they don't lend alot at one time and there is no interest or late fees. You can extend the payment date if you need too. The service is not free, it's 9.99 a month I think that's kind of high and I don't like surprises, I didn't see anywhere that stated a monthly fee until I activated the safety net. I took off 2 stars otherwise it's really good.",
      "It's a decent app if you have one of the major banks like Chase, Wells Fargo, or Bank of America. Otherwise don't waste your time setting it up. The money comes in a decent time if you chose express for a few bucks. They also let you extend your due date too. I just wish the balance could update more frequent."

      "This app is just perfect! I have been using it for months now and I love it. No invasive ads. No trouble, disputes, discrepancies, or anything. Besides, the money comes so fast. I don't know how long this app will be available, or free to use, but it has saved me countless times and I use it very often.",
      "I had this app for quite some time. I love it. The only thing is I have never got an update on how much I can request and I'm pretty sure that by now with on-time payments and my requests I should get an update. And my paydays sometimes are off so they try to pull too early but with the date change option, it can be avoided.",
      "The app was working fine but after the update, I enjoyed it even more. It works faster and no problem to log in. No complaints. Also, the customer support is really on top of it, makes life less stressful when things work as intended. thanks a lot, if I need money, I will deal with you again.",
      "This app has such cool features, so I decided to leave my feedback here. The first time I heard about this app from my colleague, she used it some time ago. Yes, I was amazed by how easily can I receive money. Instead of waiting for bank decisions, I just fulfilled the form and received my money in the day.",
      "Nice design and interface. I needed to fix a bike but the problem was money. I had tried several apps but it wasn’t a good experience. Somehow, I found this app and it saved me! Everything is clear. Money is real; it isn’t a lie or affair. It’s super useful stuff for everyone. No complaints here!"

      "The app is fine but the card has got to be the worse one I've ever had. I have a measly 400 dollar limit with Premier. I used it to pay for something before payday. Then I paid it off on payday but because it wasn't done processing by the end of the day, The card was declined at WALMART. Super embarrassing. Oh and the amount was 91 dollars and some change not even close to the amount of available credit and it might take a week to post to your card once they've pulled it from your bank.",
      "Not up to par with other banking Apps. You can't have more than one checking account added without replacing the other. So if you try to add a second checking account, it will replace the first one you have. Other than that, the Mobile Banking App is mediocre at best. Allow us to leave a travel notice when travelling or to lock our Cards for when they're not in use. Please do regular updates and add new features either weekly or monthly. A lot of missing features. I hope to see some updates.",
      "It used to be a good app but now I cant get it to open. I click on the app and I get a blank white screen and it stays that way until I close all apps on my phone, then it just goes to my home screen. Its fully updated, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, still isn't working.",
      "This is rediculace I just got the card 1 month ago and I'm sure it's a good card but ever since the recent update, the app permanently crashed and will not open. Therefore I cannot log in to check or pay anything. I also went to mobile app support and the first premier bank web site and I see they have my log in info, but do not recognize me and will not connect with me and again I have no access. It makes no sense. I have never seen such a bad system set up.",
      "Horrible new version. App brings me to a website and i have to select the app version. Less options, can not access account info like before. go back to the old version. If i could have selected 0 stars i would have"

      "It's a good app that I use daily. I do however find it slightly buggy and therefore should probably still be classes as BETA. It is also a bit frustrating that you can funds to their exchange through the app, but you can't draw it out through the app. The exchange is still in BETA, but I would like to see this feature soon.",
      "Have come to like this app due to it's versatility and convenience in converting cryptocurrency into cash for immediate access using debit card. Transfer of funds to/from other exchanges was quick and easy. MCO rewards are a plus. I've easily paid bills with debit card and withdrawn funds via ATM. My one issue, which was my error, was quickly resolved and fixed by a professional customer service team. An explanation of my error and assurance they could fix it was above and beyond.",
      "Good, but not ready for prime time. Security issue: whitelisting addresses is instant -- there should be a 48-72hr waiting period. Can't withdraw some crypto like XTZ. The fees for withdrawing USDC were $1, where even Coinbase does it for free. No instant dividends- Coinbase pays 5% dividends on XTZ for just keeping it there without you having to do anything extra, unlike cryptocom",
      "Loved the app at first all was great really liked the security they provide and all a sudden they close my account saying they were revamping ect not exact words but something along those lines but not before i had set up a deposit of about $240 in USD. They assured me the deposit would not go threw and be sent back to bank of sender.... wrong i get an email informing me the deposit was in my crypto account cant log in want re me to do the varification process again!?!??! I JUST WANT MY MONEY!",
      "Difficult to get your money back. You can transfer as little as you want, depending on the minimum amount to purchase, but you have to have a certain amount to withdraw the money back to your bank account, if you can figure that ish out. I only got thia account for a high prize in another app and neither company knows what they're doing so I'm out the prize and my money. It's only $20 but still. Stay away. Stay Far away."

      "I'm amazed by the other app ratings. Although this app has not crashed, it is so lazily built. All links redirect to website pages that are not at all optimized for mobile. Feels like I'm on a desktop browser crunched into a tiny screen. Terrible experience. The only point of this app is that it's easier to sign in, with fingerprint for example, than in a browser.",
      "This app does not allow me to do anything of value but see my balance. Every time I need to do something it goes out of mobile mode and goes to desktop mode where I can barely read anything. It also has frequent bouts of cannot view this page at this time. The whole reason I wanted the mobile app was so I could do a direct reimbursement after I have to pay an expense up front but this app does not allow that. It simply functions to tell me how much I have. Poor functionality. I may uninstall.",
      "I love the app! Great and frightening at the same time. The app is easy to use and easy to understand, great. I thought being involved would be cool, yes and a resounding no! I like being able to check the status I just need to curb my impulse to check every day. A watched pot never boils....or something like that.",
      "I love how easy the information is to access. Plus the convenient buttons to alter contributions. It tracks all accounts, HSAs, 529Cs, 401Ks and even stock options. There are also great videos on money management and investment planning. Plus it shows you how you are tracking on your retirement, including assumptions for your company's traditional pension models (if your corporate supports this function).",
      "Great app. It helps you see everything that is happening with your 401k. A little bid more detailed description of the different types of contributions would be helpful. I dont really understand the stock investment section either."

However, you aren't yet able to connect to my Capital One bank account because \"their software might be old\"? This is unbelievably annoying. Capital One is a major bank and provider, and I don't have any other banks, so to find out I can't connect my bank is extremely dissatisfying. Fix this ASAP.",

However my card balance doesnt ever refresh and I constantly have to refresh my bank connection because my transactions are never up to date.",

After multiple calls and emails, I am still unable to send money to my children in Uganda and SendWave refuses to approve the transaction. This all was supposed to be simple. Going back to a confirmed business like Western Union.",
      "The convenience is five stars, however you have to be alert with current exchange rate, my rates on my app kept dropping which made me suspicious, checked the rate online and found wave rate to be a bit low. I decided to use my other phone with the same account and the rate was a little higher than my regular phone I used for transactions, I was about to send an amount that would cost $25 motre to send that same amount. Please open your eyes, it's about bottom line for businesses.",
      "I really loved this app, until they send my money after they say to text me when system is up & running again. I went and use different money transfer because I never got text from sendwave! I ended up double sending! When I called them to stop the transaction, they didn't even acknowledge it was fault on their part! Two star for not owning up to your errors!",
      "A friend introduced me to this app, but signing up has been hell for me. The app would not allow me into input my confirmation code to conclude the sign up. This is a no-no for me, especially knowing I'll be entrusting my money to them. I'll go back to my Worldremit.",
      "I am not sure if this app works in the United states..... Two problems... first, I tried to log into my first account and entered the correct logins but required me to validate the three numbers on the back of my Credit Card which I actually lost it.... so I wasn't able to log in... Secondly, I tried to open a new account but it keep asking me to disable VPN/Proxy which I never used in the first place..... Last time I wanted to use this app had service to Tanzania interrupted."

      "The app is great! I've only had 1 problem with it though, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. The app has said that my bill is \"due soon,\" rather than due now or past due causing a late charge. This is something that I hope will soon be corrected. Possibly even getting a refund of said late charges? Anyway, I'm also curious as to why only 2 of my 3 Synchrony accounts are accessible through the Synchrony app?",
      "Synchrony Sucks. Synchrony Bank is the worst. When I got the alert of the change I had a feeling it was not going to be good. My limit was increase about 3 or 4 months ago fast forward to today, they decreased my credit limit to my balance amount. Keep in mind my accounts are up to date. I pay on time, been with hsn for years. I don't like the fact that they increase your limit one month then 2 or 3 months later they decrease it. That affects your credit . Just wrong, once I pay it off I'm out",
      "Absolutely worthless app. I have been trying to get signed in and register my card for months. I can access my info online just fine. I finally just paid off the card and will be closing it tomorrow because it takes a good 5 minutes to get logged in to even check my balance.",
      "The app works fine for what it is. I had the other app and made my payments through there but when they switch everything to this app, I didn't receive any notice. So when I went to make my normal payment it wouldn't go through which made me late and charged me a late fee",
      "Synchrony owns so many store cards I can't keep all the passwords straight for all the accounts. They need one account to log into, listing all the cards. Going to pay off the store cards, and use just MC/Visa at the stores, to end the constant frustration."

      "It'll take getting used to. I decided to go online and log in first before doing the app. The online process was easy allowing me to reset my pw and asked security questions. Once on the page it was a lot more detailed and a bit confusing at first but I played around with it and it got better. Once I logged off online I went to the app and uninstalled the old app and restarted my phone reinstalling the new app. Make sure to use the new pw set online on the app on the 1st login. Hope this helps.",
      "This used to be a decent app but since the new mobile banking, can't log into the app even after creating a new password. Such a pain =( and the Dev's response is \"make sure your password contains only allowed special characters or you'll receive an error\" 😒 This is a case of \"least effort possible\" without even addressing the problem that the app is useless at this point because YOU CANNOT LOG IN.",
      "I've tried logging in online, it verifies and has me set a new password but then a network error occurs. I've tried through the app and the same thing. I've tried through my laptop and same thing. I've called customer service like asked but that didn't help. Before you implement a new system make sure it runs smoothly.",
      "After waiting two days for an updated app I thought it would be better but it's not. Cannot log into the app even after entering verification codes via text and uninstalling then reinstalling the app. Can only log on online. The update wasn't needed and the last version was much simpler and easy to manage.",
      "I must agree the old app was more user friendly. Someone at AllSouth really needs to look at the current messages that users get when trying to old into the old app. You need to delete the old app and reinstall the new app. The new mobile app does work but that is not what the user interface says."
