      "Super solid calc, that actually shows all TVM values at the same time! If I'm nitpicking, I'd say the orange and blue alt-function fonts could be a bit larger _before_ toggling them on (LG G6). They're certainly huge _after_ toggling, but then I have to toggle both to read everything. Also some button skeuomorphism would rock. Maybe tint the bottom third of each button, for that HP look? Just a thought. Still, nice work!!",
      "This app is bewildering to me. I got this calculator so i can learn how to manage money. But the buttons have cryptic abbreviations - how can i find out what they all mean? I paid extra so I'd have every option available to me, such as Date calculations. I cant figure out how to use it, and I cant find any help in the app or on their website. This is just one of the many things on the calculator that I cant use because so much of it is unexplained. A manual or built-in help is needed!",
      "I purchased this app and it always crashes on me. Im wondering why? I then try to reinstall the app and it takes forever to install? Does anyone have an idea why this happens??",

      "not possible to choose whether I want to keep the screen on or not while the calculator is open. when the calculator is on the screen, the screen will remain on until it drains the battery. this app is a battery drainer... I don't like an app that drains my cell's battery with no option for me to decide how i want to use the app. I bought instead the 10BA PRO from \"seritiga.pro\" which has the option."

Thanks for all of your hard work so far!",

      "I really enjoy this app, but only the premium version. I understand keeping some features locked to encourage payment, but I didn't feel like I was gaining anything with the free version. that being said, the premium version is a very reasonable price considering what other apps charge. the only thing I really wish is that pulling up a saved customer's profile was easier to access once it loads their number/address, since I keep gate codes, requests, and reminders in the customer notes",
      "I can't believe how perfect this app is!!! The creater had to have worked as a delivery driver for quite a while... It's virtually impossible that someone who hasn't done this kind of work would know EXACTLY what someone in this field wants and needs. Anyway, no matter how perfect an app is, if it's NOT easy to use, literally on-the-fly, it would be WORTHLESS!! What makes it GENIUS is how easy it is to enter data. I tried the free version first, and immediately realized that $2.99 is a steal!!!",
      "Stellar app! I am so incredibly impressed with this app! It keeps everything I need for all my deliveries right here! There is a small learning curve but once you get used to using this app you will wonder how you EVER got by without it. It's so organized, streamlined and keeps everything you need right at your fingertips. I love how I can see my nightly breakdown in several ways. I can go back and see how someone paid to make sure my numbers are correct. Thank you for creating this amazing app",
      "I absolutely love this app, it keeps track of basically everything I need. My only gripe is that I can't store an order number with each delievery. It would be really helpful to be able to glance back at an order and know what order number belonged to it.",
      "Fantastic app. Definitely worth the bucks. Highly recommend this for anyone wanting to organize their deliveries and gain a statistical perspective as well, provided all information is accurate."

I found a ”solution” (more like a work-around) from other reviewers. To paraphrase, if the app does not reply to input, turn the phone on its side into landscape mode. Tap ”Menu”, then ”Reset”. That made the app function again but does not excuse the total lack of response from HP. Leaving rating at 2 for that reason.",
      "I have had this app for years and it was useful, just like the physical calculator. It recently stopped working and Uninstall and re-install did not fix the problem. Maybe the October 2019 update broke the app. In any event, it is useless now.",
      "I used to love this app... But now it has stopped working, and it no longer responds to user inputs. The haptic feedback works, but there is no number display, which renders it useless The last update is listed as late October, so I suspect that screwed things up. Let's get on it, HP! Okay - it seems that all I needed to do was to re-set the application, and now it works perfectly. That puts it back up to 5-star territory. There was no better financial calculator & there is no better emulator.",
      "Recently purchased the Galaxy Note 10+ now this app doesn't run on this device. Have uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn't work. Wonder what HP will do about it? I have just discovered if you go into landscape view hit the menu then reset. It started to work.",

      "Simple layout and easy to use. Needs some work to make a full personal customisation, but once there, it works very well. Requires a little bit of tweaking to integrate credit cards...sort of. Expense and income categories needs some better sorting, but can be edited for personal use. 20 years ago I used Quicken a lot. This comes very close it.",
      "Been using this for years. The thing I like most is that it doesn't embed invasive tracking into my financial routine and its very customisable. Some people seem to prefer handing over all their financial data to a third party in exchange for some very simple budgeting tools (categorise expenses etc). This requires more work but in the process forces me to be mindful about what I'm actually doing and planning.",
      "I've been using this app for a while and it's been amazing. I made it to my 40s not realizing how helpful budgeting can really be. This app is well worth the money and not needing to log in or subscribe is a big plus. I've never been able to save money like I do now until budgeting \"clicked\" for me while using this app. It has been and still is absolutely perfect for me. Thank you!",
      "I was looking for something I could purchase once and use offline, ad-free, and I decided on this app. It was easy to set up, has useful features, and adding transactions is quick. Overall it's a great value.",
      "Amazing app, been using it for so long and it have never failed me. Alot of features and regular updates. I like the fact that is all offline so there it is not intrusive like other apps that will need accounts and internet connection."

      "Good app for financial tracking and family sync is great. Downfall is that the budget feature shows the current spend for categories but does not compare this to progression of the budget period so you can't see if you are on track to meet budget. I thought this would be a critical feature to assist tracking and meeting budget. I have requested the feature from developer more than a year ago.",
      "Seamless sync. Love it. Neat interface. However, it would be great if there is a dashboard for all transactions including transfers, expenditures, and income for the month. It would be easy to keep track of my cash flow instead of having to open each screen (income/expense/accounts) to check the entries.",
      "Very good app to keep track of expenses and accounts. Can keep a budget and check the expenses against it. Allows to create different accounts and payee for bills. Also has facility to log recurring payments and transfers. Awesome app. Worth buying and using it. Helps to keep track of the expenses well.",
      "There is problem with this app. They only keep track the data for 3 years and the rest which I have been using it went missing from the app. Pls solve this problem.",
      "This app is complete enough to provide a massive amount of options and conveniences. Yet it is simple enough to use without trouble. Furthermore, it has a great presentation and the sync option with other family members is much better than I thought and then I read from some people's review. Just try it out for yourself and don't read the comments, I made my own opinion and it's a total success. The only thing I haven't yet found at this point is the Samsung Watch Android app to see and enter data from my watch ;-), this would make this app the best ever!"

Just found out today i can add widgets, i have date, and weather. I hope the developer makes a million. What a fantastic effort!!!",
      "I like it very much, the included faces aren't really that good but the fact that it gives the complication is the most important part. That being said, it would be VERY nice and worth an extra star if users could modify the update time interval, as the current 5 minutes or so is just too long for the crazy crypto markets! Please add this, 5 seconds minimum would be nice, obviously not great for battery life but leave it up to the user. edit: no real reason to not have five stars!",
      "I am using a Fossil Sport, The app is polished and works well enough in the features and purpose, I only have one problem and it isn't even an issue, some of the Icon files are not transparent when using, if you could update the small thumbs to be high res transparent pngs would make the 5*.",
      "Functionally excellent but, artistically extremely limited. Could really do with some more face designs. Also, please add some faces that show not just time but also date (format as per device) ...I never realised how often I looked at my watch for date, until it wasn't there!",
      "this is a must have for any one trading or investing in cryptocurrencies. great job by the developer, no app on the Play Store can compare at this time. Thank you very much for putting this together."

      "I've been using this app across the apple platform for years and it's been great. As with all money apps it depends on your discipline in entry. Now I have an android phone I'm also using it across platform. Syncbits works really well to keep everything sync'd across all devices. I've not really used too many other money apps but of thise I've used this has been the best.",
      "A dream come true app. It is very robust yet very user friendly and flexible to adapt to your liking. SyncBits is amazingly fast and accurate. Last but not least,appreciate the personal touch of developers to answer specific queries promptly. I use the same login on 3 devices Windows PC , spouse iPhone and my Samsung Android phone..no issues.",
      "This is easy to use with multiple accounts and syncs easily between multiple devices including iOS and Android. I don't use the online banking sync that's offered by moneywiz. Highly recommended",
      "This is the only version currently that doesn't require a subscription which makes it free to use and they do do have quick customer service. I highly recommend this version of you need something to keep track of your money and bills works great and can be synched across devices and supports iOS and Android",
      "I tried using the premium version but when I put my bank details in, it kept saying \"unexpected variations, please try again in a few days\". I've now wasted the entire free trial period due to this error, and I will not be continuing with this app. This is a real shame as I liked what the app had to offer, but unfortunately it just didn't work."

      "I have purchased and used expensive and complicated budget software and it has served me well, but my wife found it a little daunting. With Budget Calendar I can keep track of my finances just as well as the expensive software with a much simpler and easy to use interface. My wife likes it as well.",
      "After over 5 yrs using YNAB I finally dropped them, they used to have a similar desktop app that links to smartphone app, but now it's only a web online that links to smartphone with limited capabilities. I do have a question, what is the best way to sync this thru Google Drive. I have both the Budget Calendar Software and the Android App. Desktop Version, I have to end up saving to a local file then uploading to Google Drive, there is no sync option on the desktop version. Then on Android, I look for the file from google drive, sometimes it doesn't appear so I end up downloading from google drive to the phone's local storage and load from there, vice versa on both after I make changes, I save to local and upload to google, only to be downloaded. Where is the sync option on both Desktop and Android versions? I will also post this question on the Desktop Software website... Please help....",

      "I've been using this for years now and it's been instrumental in my day to day budgeting. Once you get used to the interface, how to add and remove items etc it's easy to use and a solid performer.",
      "I have been using this product since 2010 when it was only available as computer software and I'm beyond thrilled that it now has an app! I have tried dozens of other budgeting apps trying to get one with similar features on my phone only to be let down. This calendar-based budgeting system has saved me untold amounts in bank fees because I can look ahead and know what my balance will be on any particular day in the future. It takes into consideration that payments are due on different days throughout the month and allows you to plan accordingly. And now I don't have to even open my laptop to get to it! I'm so excited!! Also, I've had to contact the developer a couple times when I upgraded to a new computer and the customer service has been top notch each time. Thank you so much for the past 8 years of budget help and hopefully many more in the future!"

You can add, change any entry especially if you made a mistake. Multiple categories for different entries and you can customize your own categories. The reports pie graphs are just ok...they are hard to read even on my Galaxy note 8, needs improvement. Also in the future I would develop a way I could sync with my computer."

      "Absolutely essential. A RPN calculator is a must have. If you've never used one before, take the time to learn how it works : you will never again use a \"regular-type\" calculator in your life again. Thanks so much to the developper for making such a fantastic app.",
      "This is an outstanding app that I have used nearly every day since 2011.  It was quite beneficial when I first started to use it, and it has been improved over the years. The developer has responded quickly and effectively to requests and suggestions.The functionality is now richer than the iconoclastic device on which it is modeled, and with modern processors it also calculates much faster.  This app allow me to carry one fewer device and brings an end to frequent battery replacement on the calculator. I can also use it under low light conditions. If you use financial calculations and enjoy the RPN entry method, this is a true no-brainer. I give RpnCalc Financial Calculator my highest recommendation. .",
      "Absolutely love this calculator app.  My favorite calculator has always been my embarrassingly old HP 12C, so it's wonderful to have an app that functions like it with the benefit of not having to deal with distracting ads for a reasonable price.  I love that I can lock it into portrait layout so I don't have to turn my phone to use.  The aesthetics are perfect.  It's wonderful to have its functionality in the convenience of my phone, which I always have handy, instead of having to make the choice of using a crappy calculator app or getting up to track down my HP 12C.  LOVE IT!",
      "If you use or have used a 12C calculator, this will be instantly familiar. It's fast, accurate, & actually has more functions than the old 12C. The developer responded quickly when I had trouble with getting updates, and solved the problem for me. Only wish is for a more easily readable display. Larger or heavier font for both the keys and the display would be helpful for those of us with aging vision. Otherwise, it's a great app, and one that I use daily.",
      "Little pissed I had to rebuy the app. I used the other version for years though and figured it was only right to kick the dev some more cash because the app is great and even paying twice it is still better than buying the hp12c version. Not going to lie, if it happens again, I'll simply grab the apk from a more nefarious source. If you're going to change apps like that give old users an upgrade path. Thanks for making a great product."

      "This app is a helpful way of keeping track of credit cards! It is great being able to see all you cards in one place and to be aware of spending. The labels are easy to follow, too! Maybe it's inevitable, the only downside though is plugging in info manually.",
      "A solid app to keep things clean. I use it only to keep track of what cards I have, and limits on them. I was looking for an app just to keep track of cards without displaying or entering card numbers. This is it.",
      "Does what I need it to would give 5 stars but would like it to be able to set a recurring payment and a payoff calculator prediction",
      "Goodjob to developer. Worth it keeping up monitor my spending for my credit cards accurately.",
      "Hi... 2 thoughts 1) It would be good if this app could also track debit cards as well and have the option to see both credit and debit cards together or see just credit cards or debit cards. It could also use a widget. 2. Some of my credit cards have 23 or 25 or 28 day grace periods. Does the app figure that out or could there be a way to input that? Lastly could it keep track of which card to use to have the longest grace period and to maintain a certain percent utilization on each card? I'd pay more to have all those features"

      "I looked at and tried about 20 different banking apps, and this one suited my needs best! I had been using Banktivity with a MacBook, but since switching to ChromeBook I needed to find a different option. Expense Manager met all the criteria I was looking for. And the developer was very helpful in the beginning as I was figuring out how to set my information up and learn a different way of logging my expenses. Very pleased!",
      "My first time reviewing an app on Play Store. I've been using this app for more than 5 years now. I must say, I like the versatility and freedom provided to me, the user, in terms of the kinds of information I would like captured. Some new cool features: Parsing SMS messages to create expense records (I'm trying this out). Useful when you set SMS alert triggers when you spend something on your credit card. Exporting to excel: Useful for my own charting Moving to Pro to support developer",
      "This is a great app, easy to use, good visuals and reporting filters, good export format. Only drawback is that the synch to Dropbox is at file level not transaction level: if you use 2 devices at the same time(sharing with family) , the one you exit last overwrites changes from the other device.",
      "I had the free version of this but upgraded because I'd rather support the developer directly than have free apps supported by advertising. I've worked in finance for a national charity, so I'm used to banking capital via segmented income streams and running tailored database queries on income sources and expenditure. I could literally have done my last job using only this app and a budget Android, rather than a clunky database and desktop P.C. I currently use it for personal finance.",
      "Been using the free version for over 5 years, but only recently bought the pro version to support the devs for such an excellent and useful app. Simple to use and sync between devices, it is easy to record and keep track of expenditure and income. Highly recommended."

I can use this app to keep track of how much money I have left including both cash and credit. User friendly and a great tool to stay on track!",
      "I have tested a lot of budget apps. This one just does exactly what it says it does and it does it VERY well. No unessesary fluff by trying to be too clever, no mining of your spending habits data like pocketbook, no ongoing subscription (this was an essential feature for me). I use this with my husband and it syncs with no issues. Tech support was also responsive when I needed it. Thank you for building and maintaining something that just works like German engineering.",
      "Hello, Would it be possible to add a savings account that would not show up in expenses and remaining money total? I.e. have an option to deliver money into savings account that you can no longer touch? Also would be graat to show how much your savings grew over the year etc.",
      "App has been great for keeping family's finances on track. Intuitive and comfotable layout/interface. I like that I have to input all data to give me full control. Many other finance apps want to have you link your bank account to it. The synchronization function is excellent and works perfectly between myself and my wife using Google Drive. Definitely the most complete of the finance tracking apps I've worked with. I'd recommend this app to anyone in a heartbeat.",
