It will notify u when your getting close to your budget limit. Splendid!",

      "This app is very simple and intuitive in its format but many things are full of glitches and it is very limited in what it offers. I cannot figure out how to transfer my funds to a different bank account. I have a prepaid card for plasma donation at Grifols and they used to use Wirecard before they switched to BoA. I preferred Wirecard infinitely more.",
      "Be PATIENT! The \"fingerprint\" login WORKS just fine. When you get the \"fingerprint recognized\" message - if you wait just a moment - you will be rewarded with your account balance and other click-able settings & information. Believe me, please... The biometric login WORKS!",
      "App works as it should. Quick to update transactions. The only downfall (which isn't a huge deal) is the fingerprint access doesn't work. I set it up, it recognizes fingerprint, but when I go to log in the next time it doesn't work. All my other banking apps have no issue.",
      "Worst banking app. From day one months ago I made a account. Have never been able to log in. Ive try many of times to reset password never ever ever has it emailed me any type of link with a code to do so. Never. Huge pain in the ass have to call every time. And at the least why cant i just send a txt to see balance so i dont have to even bother with the app."

      "So far things are working fairly well with app. Although I find it strange that since I am using the app often,I have been receiving calls from robo-messeges stating my ssn is being \"suspended \" due to suspicious activity and to call a specific number. I call the number and usually receive a voice recording telling me that the mailbox is full and to try again later. If this is true at all, wouldn't it be posted in all this glorious information that you provide to me?",
      "I highly recommend this app. It's not only free, but more importantly, a great educational tool to teach you how to use credit wisely as well as improve your own credit score. And now offering even more updated financial advice to help you wisely get through the Covid-19 pandemic. Love all the new features! Bravo Credit Sesame! 😊",
      "One of the most reliable Apps you could find out there. Compared to other apps that provide similar services, I wished Credit Sesame could keep track of score updates on a more timely fashion. Other than that, it is reliable, and provides best tips towards a healthy credit score.",
      "Quickly showed me my credit score, and negative mark against that I didn't know of. Quickly matched me to banks that I had the best odds of being approved for line of credit to start building my score again. It's been fast and painless. Great job!",
      "Credit Sesame is very good it helps you put your credit back into place. I have told all my friends and I hope they start checking their credit scores that is why I gave you a 5 stars you guys are awesome."

      "It's easy to use. They're a little behind but definitely improving consistently. But there's a few features that I'm not 100% in love with. Like the payment stuff. Only saving one bank account to make payments. And it's slow to make them. I do like it overall, though. Definitely have experienced way worse. And anything they lack here has been made up with on the phone customer service in my experiences. Thanks, guys!",
      "I had to uninstall this several times, I have nothing but problems with this app it used to work until my last update. I don't remember what date that was but I haven't used this app for several months now,I install it again and it's telling me my password or username is incorrect, I can use it online and everything is correct, but the app won't work. with this coronavirus scare tactic I am not able to get in touch with anyone by phone it's long wait times. 🤔🤷",
      "Thank goodness for apps such as these that make payments easy! Credit One is the only company who took a chance on me, due to my not having any credit history except hospital bills that are illegally on my report (I'm disputing them) because they've been on there over a decade and should've been removed from my report years ago. Now, I pay each full balance of my credit card off before the minimum payment is even due just to show CO they took a chance on the right person!! Thank you Credit One!",
      "I really like using the app more so than logging onto site via computer, laptop, etc. It makes it a lot easier for me, because I suffer from some serious PTSD, which @ times gets my anxiety ratcheted up for no logical reason 😔😔. It's also great to be able to get notifications of statements so I can schedule my payments way in advance because with FMS &PTSD, my brain no longer has some serious issues with time and not realizing how much time has passed. 👍👍 for this app AND company!! ♥️♥️",
      "The app always gives you an error message stating that i do not have internet service even on wifi. Other apps work on my phone as well as rhe internet. Customer service was a waste of time. 2 hour phone call for nothing...the outsourced customer service reps are the worst. They are very unhelpful and rude. The only way to get anything done is to get a rep in the U.S. otherwise it will be a frustrating experiance. Save time amd frustration and get a card with another financial institution."

      "So far, so good! I've received my advanced after being asked a bunch of questions including asking your SSN just letting you know. They do ask that you put back at least $1 for what they call a rainy day fund which is withdrawn from your account attached monthly as well. I have not however used the Gold feature of the app, which actually asks that you expend more money to interact with that and I don't need that feature anyway.",
      "Bank balance updates are a little slow but I love having all my accounts monitored in one place. I keep track of my student loans and credit cards. Also the investing portion has been working out well. It's simple, easy and great for me to get some experience playing around in the stock market.",
      "Loving it already. Day one and I've already switched my car insurance because of the app's insurance comparing tool. I have a clear idea of what I spend on (bills/non essentials) and where I can save. I feel productive and set up for success.",
      "Just give me the money on my prepaid debit cards until I get an actual bank debit card. I will spend as I want to spend. But this app could keep track of it all in a cute funny way. Lol good like better for me. I want to have my money already in my ears in my eyes like so to move on and a way for it to always get to me Real fast and easy.",
      "Im so upset. I tryed this app thinking it was lime dave and it is really not! They charge you right from the start. They wont let you get to the main menu untill you pay. They take money from your real account and put it into their own account. So they can take my money and are all in my bank and i cant get out of it or cancle it in anyway. I feel like i just got scammed and now they wont answer me.. Someone please help me."

      "After my original review I was contacted by the developer who told me that this option is available on the map. I guess I missed it. Hopefully I won't need roadside assistance soon, but this is good to know. Thanks. Original review: App is getting better/easier to use but one big improvement that could be made to roadside assistance would be to allow the option of typing in an address rather than tap the destination on a map. If I break down in an unfamiliar city and need a tow to a place where I've never been, it might be difficult to locate the destination on a map.",
      "App is almost as bad as there service. No feature works properly. Doesnt save anything correctly. The features they choose to implement wouldn't be that helpful even if they worked properly. Not to mention there service is abhorrent and actively tries to screw you out of what you paid for.",

      "Terrible app! Is never up to date when it should be the most up to date thing i can view as far as my policy. Cant pake payments until they are late and policy is about to be cut off. But i can make a full years payment on my homeowners policy...makes no sence. I should be able to make a payment at any point in time. Till then 1 star",

First problem I was having was logging in, but that's been corrected, then the app wouldn't show my current due bill, but that looks liked it's been corrected as well!!! I'll see when the time comes and give 5-STARS!!! Great app!!! Thanks!!! : ) DW, OH"

      "It's OK except that every single time you log in online it shows a page where you can sign up to become a paying member and how great a service it would be to be fully protected from scammers and such. The service they offer is minimal and it sends an email when it detects a change in your credit. The FICO score and Credit Report are free so it's not that bad. The app just takes up extra space on your phone and that page (very annoying) still shows up. They should include it in the menu.",
      "I did what this app told me to do. It says I don't have enough credit history and i look risky to lenders. You need 5 credit card types .then it picked out what was best matched for me with my score and how i spend already etc ,etc.. I was denied on the first 2 and my score just dropped 18 points immediately. I didn't even bother trying anymore. I didnt even want too in the first place but was told this would help me out. Yeah right.",
      "I keep having sign in problems. I have had to change my password 3 times. I changed it last night. Got in fine a minute ago, when to log back in after closing out and it's not accepting the SAME password. I have even tried all my other passwords just in case and retyped the known password 3 times. I'm getting very frustrated with this app. I didn't pay 20 bucks a month for a service I can't use.",
      "Since last app update, cannot log in, at all. Password text box won't even accept the cursor. Update 3/17/20: you did it, again! Broke the app. Nothing on the login screen is clickable. Un/reinstalling the app does NOT fix it. 😡 Yes, I already emailed you at the address, below. Still awaiting a reply... Oh, good! Glad to hear you are working on a solution.",
      "How long is the website/App going to keep having \"technical\" issues? For the past 3 weeks I have been trying to verify bills on my account to boost my credit score, but every time I do it; all I get is  \"Uh oh…We had an issue connecting. The team is looking into it. Please try again later\" I may have to uninstall from my phone if it continues like this"

I know that I qualify for this, so I'm a little bit perturbed that the developers couldnt get this one right...I guess I am just destined to fill out one more form...on another site, and I will come out ahead....despite my FRUSTRATION. My OME star rating is honestly A HUGE STRETCH OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE WITH YOU",

After the reopening, the app worked as usual. I could connect the lender and get my money easily as before."

      "Great app but makes no sense. Supposed to help prevent overdrafts, but only if you're gonna overdraft within eleven days of payday, and if you overdraft before then, it considers you a 'risky investment' and won't even loan you $20 so I've been able to use it once and apparently that's all she wrote because it's only good for the end of the month. if you get paid monthly instead of bi weekly you're basically screwed. Edit: now it's only $5 instead of $20....",
      "It's nice and all that a quick $50 or $100 shows up when you need it. Like when your gas tank is too close to low and too far from payday, or you racked up a high dinner bill, that money shows up pretty quick. It also let's you know that you are too risky or broke so restricts the amount. I appreciate that the most since other payday loans will just rob you.",
      "During this time of unstability you can't get an advance is crazy. A rule is if your card expires in 2 or 3 months you can't get an advance which is crazy because the banks don't send out cards months in advance. So now we're stuck for the next 2 months. But good app. Has helped me last until a payday if i need it. Much easier to use then other apps like it. Much more giving to people that get money any many different ways unlike other apps being strict with their acceptance of certain incomes.",
      "Only complaint I have is that once you automatically pay back what you owe you have to wait until the next business day before you can use it again. Definitely not a reason to not use by any means as you can have a negative balance and they will still deposit in your account. I've used other payday services like branch and moneylion, and they all let you take money out the same day you pay back. Overall I give 5 out of 5 though and am currently on the waiting list for the $100 advance.",
      "it was nice to get the cash advance right away after signing up, but I felt a little bit like I was tricked into leaving a tip, which I didn't feel comfortable doing yet the first time around, especially because the whole reason I got the app was since money has been tight. By default 15% tip was selected, and then hitting the thank-you button submitted my choices tipping that amountand there was no obvious way to select no tip. I think what you have to do is actually just close the application"

Paying via this app - two transactions first $1.25 second for $.85. Tried several times. I would call it a scam! Update : What said below on rollback transaction is true. However the problem is that I never see that rollback transaction in lgpay but only in bank client. And as I said if you pay with gpay you'll see just one transaction in the app & bank client.",

      "So, I've been an advocate for Current since I had heard good things about its features. However, when you lose access to logging in because of a phone number change?? makes you glad that you only put in $40… but I kinda need my money that I saved for a rainy day (hmm maybe 'pandemic' day)?? Now my app is trying to make me apply for a new card… Get your coder tested. I think they're sick!!",
      "First of all the only thing I have liked about this card is my check was deposited early. The fact that I did not want the premium account and wanted to read the fine print about it, because I hit the button and signed up for the 4.99 a month. Then you deactivate the old card before I received a new one is just ludicrous to me. Next, I go to transfer my funds from the account and the system is down. Let's just say you have lost a customer. I immediately stopped my check from being deposited.",
      "They can get better. Need to fix current to current pay sometimes doesn't work you gotta send an email and wait like 7 days for a reply. And they need to stop putting accounts under review for over 6 days while holding your money is ridiculous. Also the chat team is not very skill. You ask them a simple question and they answer like a robot. 3 out of 5 times they don't understand or don't care what you're going through.",
      "My Current card is excellent. My direct deposit arrived in 4 days. I am also excited about how my new current Card has an option button to either continue to keep the card \"active\" or to turn off the \"active\" function, when your current Card has been lost or stolen and perhaps compromised. I highly recommend the current Card to those wanting a more saver and secure card. I give the Max rating of \"All Stars\" to the creator of the current app & card.",
      "I created an account. Waited the time and received my card. Between those i got a new phone and number. Still have the same email. It's been at least two weeks that current has said my account is under review. Well, current now you're under review and it's not looking good. I'm not so sure i want an account with you anymore. The customer service is terrible. After two emails to you about this nothing has been done."

      "Having my PayPal account, and PayPal Cash card has been very convenient and easy to use. I have ran into situations where I was looking to make a purchase and the only form of payment a seller or retailer would accept is PayPal. I love the fact that PayPal insures your transaction. Also everything about using My Card and PayPal account has been smooth and easy. Thanks PayPal!!!",
      "Almost useful apart from stupid login. Enter my password and it sends a code via text, read the text and it's logged you out of the App. Log back in and repeat the same thing again and again. Only way to successfully log in is to have texts open on my PC using Android messages. Even if I open texts on my mobile before logging into the App as soon as I switch to the texts it logs me out again.",
      "Can never use the app, every time after logging in, and entering code for 2FA, it goes to a blank screen with a X in the upper left corner. If I click the X, I have to login again and do 2FA code again, and then back to the blank screen. If I reinstall the app, it works maybe one time before doing the blank page thing again. I can get get into the app. It's been like this for months now. Nothing seems to ever really fix this issue, and many others seeing the same issue. Please fix this!",
      "I use PayPal for direct deposit from work, and I love it more than any bank I've ever been with. I have a card I can use anywhere in person or online, and the balance on the app is immediately updated so i always know exactly what's in my account. I'm also provided with a detailed list of what & when my expenses were. And money can be sent immediately to other paypal users. No waiting or fees. You can even create savings accounts or money pools. This is an incredible app & i adore paypal.🖤",
      "Good App. Works great for family, shopping, and even some bill payments. My only complaint is that funds received notifications have no option to transfer to your bank. Selecting any option from the notification closes the app instead of prompting you to login to continue. This could be streamlined. Maybe leaving the app logged in would remedy that, but that would be a security risk in my opinion. Every other aspect of the app seems awesome. It's a Must have."

      "Thanks to the developers. It's a perfect service for the lazy ones. I took a quick loan in this app without leaving my house. Of course, I was doubtful about the loaner's honesty, so I checked it by taking a loan for the minimal sum. Money has been transferred without any problems. Now I send them serious requests. They always approve of them and send the money right away. I pay everything off on time, maybe that's why I'm pleased.",
      "I will be eternally grateful if they add an option to get rid of all notifications and messages with different offers. They are quite irritating. But I'm pleased with the service in general, I calculate and check how much I owe this loaner or another myself. I use it regularly because it often happens that I need financial support before I receive the next payment. I would advise it you, too.",
      "The fee isn't small. But the servicing quality, transferring speed and the app's interface compensate for it completely. I always pay my loans before the due date, and due to that, I have a good credit history. It froze a couple of times, but one call to the support team solves all the problems. Works fine overall.",
      "This app failed me only once. I couldn't enter my account. Their server had been updating in an unfortunate moment. Not considering this, everything is cool. I can see any info on my loans and payments at any second. I have never faced such problems during payback as many people write about. Thanks to operators for doing a good job.",
      "I had some issues. While taking my first loan, I hadn't read the conditions carefully, so I found out about the interest rate only when I started paying it back. Everything was honest from the loaner's side, but from mine, there was excess haste. I'll use this service in the future, If that will be necessary, but from now on I won't hurry and I'll ask more questions."

      "It does everything I need except it won't allow screen shots for \"security policy\" reasons. This prevents having proof of scheduled payments or terms of an agreement when making a payment commitment. Means I have to type confirmation numbers etc instead of taking a picture of the final screen. It's just a picture of the agreement! - NO security or account data is shown. Should be MY choice not Wells Fargo's. And no explanation is available. I'm forced to research other banks online banking now.",
      "It's a problem when I'm in the middle of using the app and it then says that my session has expired even though I haven't left it alone for even 10 seconds. It's also annoying that when I login to the app it says \"Welcome back, here's when you last logged in\" and I then have to tap to get to my account. My previous bank app after login would take me straight to my account to see my balance, I sometimes just need to know my balance and don't have the time to wait for it to load an extra screen.",
      "My experience was absolutely AAA rating. The young lady explained how to deposit my check by taking a photo of it which I've never done before & I'm a 63 year old lady and always come into the bank to deposit my check. I don't put it thru the ATM because I don't trust it, but because of coronavirus I am on quarantine & my daughter tried to deposit it thru the ATM and it wouldn't accept. Because I need my money but I did not want to go against my quarantine she helped me tremendously. Thx's 👍",
      "This app is so frustrating trying to find information. You cant even get customer service using this app. I tried finding my routing number on my app cause i wasn't home so i had to call customer service just for that information. You guys need to make your app more user friendly and have more information so that we don't have to waste our time and your employees time with the small things like a routing number.",
      "I love the app. I can pay my bills , check everything . The only thing is that when I want to send money to another coutry can't do it from the app. I have to log on computer. Overall very happy."

I've now run out of e-mails to use so I hope they just fix this issue.",

No I'm not going to spend time looking for the number, I rather write a bad review. I guess I'll never use this app. 👍🏼",
      "Terrible app. My bank never comes up, so I enter the debit card info manually and each time it say \"Uh oh, there's been an error\" proceeds to delete all 2 pages of info I filled out, and the cycle continues. Plus, I know for a fact my bank uses Zelle, because from my bank's app, I can send money using Zelle. Zelle in general is fine; the app is s#!% Use Venmo. It's miles better.",
      "Got an email notice from a friend trying to send me money. To accept, I had to enter my bank. My bank is not listed, so it defaults and tells you to open the app. Unfortunately, the transaction isn' queued up in the app, so you have to request funds from the same person. Now's there's two requests outstanding and no one is getting paid. Zelle needs to close this gap and fix this hole.",

If I click on the link they have my bank in the list but an error pops up everytime. If I use the app they don't even have my bank and if I enter in my information an error pops up again. The one time I was able to get my account I didn't have any pending activity and can't accept the money."

Every single bit of my info was entered correctly and checked and tried multiple times. Saw many bad reviews about this app, guess they were true. Also sent an email, I will post how long it takes them to reply.",
      "My credit score is going to be in jeopardy with this app and this company. The app told me that im not due for this month then next thing i know is that im past due for 4 times i think. I made 2 phone calls and tried to fix it and that i dont have to worry again. Then now the app is telling me im past due again!!!!",
      "This app has locked me out multiple times, forced me to change my password and some how charged an account that had been dead for years instead of the one they had been charging. Late fees then occurred, and I was told I could request a phone call to discuss them and never received it. Now more fees will be added, and their customer service seems to be helping make that possible. Because college and paying loans isn't hard enough.",
      "I always have trouble signing in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled many times because it keeps telling my username or password is incorrect but when I go on the website it works perfectly fine. Uninstalling for good now.",
      "For a while, i avoided the app and just used the website, but the redesign and biometric login both make using the app a much better experience. I appreciate the time that went into this."

      "The biggest drawback of this platform (SFGI) is the restriction creating passwords which entails a 15 character password limit. It is my opinion that a Federal banking institutionshould have regulations preventing them from partaking in such horrendous security practices. There is 2FA but only if you opt to leave your device as unregistered, which most people probably don't do. Device recognition is not a good form of security considering anything can be spoofed. These cons outweigh all pros.",

I wanted it to move money out of my Checking to my Savings. It it twice, and each time it did it, I had to go to the bank to fix the problem. Because I did not trust the app to do it.",

It is just really really annoying!",

App is a big improvement from where it was.",

      "This app is worst than the last one. I used to get a confirmation number on every bill pay I did online. Now nothing! I write down every online pay confirmation number on my bill for reference!Page layout was much better being able to see more payees. This was not well thought out at all!"

I will uninstall it now.",

Why can't you use any other way? Email or phone call? Why dont you provide any means for customers to call your customer service?",
      "Good app until you need customer service. They have a few very disrespectful reps and their compliance team does not gave synergy. I do think they can do better but they keep dropping the ball. After many months with them, I think you have other apps out there with better services. This is coming from a loyal customer that has just moved on.",

    "description":"Better Loans was created to help consumers access money without hassle and wasted time. We created the ultimate cash advance app for our users who need fast access to emergency money without the hassle.\r\n\r\nWe understand emergencies exist that may require access to cash. That’s why we simplified the process of finding a lender or lending partner to get the money you need. You no longer have to visit dozens of websites, fill out numerous requests or stand in line at a local store.

In addition to your own email and mailing address, you can now update your child’s account information straight from the Greenlight app (including their name, username, password, gender, birthday, email address and phone number)",

      "Easy to use and so convenient! My kids love the personalized cards and the fact that keeping up with their money is so easy! Greenlight Gifts is also a great way to get your kids money for birthdays and holidays without having to worry about it getting lost before it can't ever be used. We love our Greenlight cards!!!!",
      "Horrible! You can't delete the old cards once you order a custom card, you have to call customer service and then they end up deleting the wrong card, then you're on the phone forever trying to get it all straightened out, which doesn't happen because they can't see the pictures on the cards to know which one to delete. You also have to call to update phone numbers, addresses, basically everything instead of just doing it on the app. I wish I had never gotten it.",
      "At first I was very unhappy with the app on my android (Samsung S7) it loaded slow and ran slow. However! I registered my complaint and the next thing I know I'm talking to some of their folks and damned if they didn't trace my problem, find the cause, and release an update to the play store that fixed my problem, all withing 48 hours! Very impressed with their ability to figure it out and correct it. App runs great now and so far I'm pleased with how the whole system works. This was the first time I've ever encountered a software issue that was actually acknowledged and fixed by a company.",
      "Overall, it's a great idea. BUT there is no indication anywhere on this app store that there are in-app purchases such as a $4.99/month membership. (The fee isn't the problem just the principle.) Unpleasant surprise. Then, as I understand it, my child needs a phone to use this. I'm not sure how I feel about all this, so I'll probably look elsewhere for a solution.",
      "Love Greenlight. I personally love all the security mechanisms. I did have to call when trying to add another funding source but it's for my security and customer service was efficient in assisting me. We have kids living in two households so it makes it so much easier to provide for them immediately if a need pops up. They are using the saving function, and learning to budget. I also love that the children's info is on the backside of the card, so no worry about strangers getting their name"

It should either be the same fee as going to one of their designated locations or at least a little cheaper because the money takes a few days to arrive to its destination. I guess they figure they will charge you for the convenience of not leaving the house while making the other party wait a few days for their money. The app itself is great though.",

The only thing is I have never got an update on how much I can request and I'm pretty sure that by now with on-time payments and my requests I should get an update. And my paydays sometimes are off so they try to pull too early but with the date change option, it can be avoided.",
      "The app was working fine but after the update, I enjoyed it even more. It works faster and no problem to log in. No complaints. Also, the customer support is really on top of it, makes life less stressful when things work as intended. thanks a lot, if I need money, I will deal with you again.",
      "This app has such cool features, so I decided to leave my feedback here. The first time I heard about this app from my colleague, she used it some time ago. Yes, I was amazed by how easily can I receive money. Instead of waiting for bank decisions, I just fulfilled the form and received my money in the day.",

      "Awesome app. Definitely helps that stupid loophole of \" to have good credit, you have to have credit already in order to build credit\". This app and many others alike help young people like me get started on building credit out of nothing. Very happy with it. The credit card though, is there anyway to increase the credit without paying off the balance just yet? The whole point is keep paying over the year or two to build said credit, but a higher credit limit would be nice.",
      "This is the most amazing app ever for anyone who needs to build/rebuild their credit. I had filled ch. 7 bankruptcy and been discharged about a year ago now. Needless to say, my credit was looking rough. Now, after 2 months of payments, credit is up 136 points! I don't know how it works, but it works and that's all I care about. Amazing service being provided here with equal opportunities for all.",
      "Since I was already working on my credit prior to getting the CD (Dec 19) and CC (Feb 20) thru them, I can't say for sure which did what or anything at all but my credit has gone up at the minimum 50 points already! But the app is very useful and user friendly. Has an answer for pretty much everything I had a question regarding. I have the $150 12 month loan!",
      "My credit went up a couple points after opening account. The thing that i do not like is the daily withdrawls that come out if my account. It is only pennies daily but after a year this will add up. I am sure it is some kind of interest or fees. I will finish off the term of the loan and will most likely be done with it but anything can happen. I have only had this account for two months. So a little early to tell",
      "Excellent service. I was skeptical as there are a lot of \"fake\" or misleading services that exploit people with no/low or bad credit, especially of lower incomes. If used responsibly, this WILL build your credit, and build a bit of savings that can be used to also get a secured VISA credit card that compliments the main account. It WILL hurt your credit if payments are missed, etc... but if you are trying to build/fix your credit but are on a fixed or lower income it's still manageable $25/mo."

      "This app makes everything Geico very easy. I suggest that if you're going to have their insurance coverage you use the app. Save-A-Lot on paperwork saves a lot of hassle for the customer service people. And if you have to use customer service it's no big deal they're some of the most amazing people on Earth anyways.",
      "The EASIEST app for all of your insurance needs! I had to make a claim a few months ago and was able to do it completely through the app in minutes. Also I needed to postpone this weeks payment and literally had it done after 3 taps on the screen! Great job, Geico!",
      "I've had GEICO insurance for almost 30 years. I didn't switch to USAA after joining the military and I won't switch to any other insurer when I retire soon (Yay!). The reason is, no other insurer could give me full coverage including a rental if needed plus towing if needed for the same price or less, than GEICO. With GEICO I get more coverage for less money. Other insurers offered me less coverage for more money.",
      "This app stops responding more often than it actually returns any data when you click something. I'm often putting my phone down for it to lock before the app actually loads anything. Either it's an issue with the app or geicos api. Either way, nearly unusable.",
      "Old version was infinitely better. In this version there's no telling if what you click on will get you stuck in an endless loading loop. What are your developers doing? Did none of this show up in QA testing??"

They said this was one of the best ones, while other apps demonstrate different problems. As for me, I’ve never used any of them, so I took their advice. I didn’t regret it. Both registration and getting the money didn’t take long.",
      "I always repay the debt a bit earlier than I’m supposed to (paying less interest). Ask the operators and they will tell you everything in detail about how to save interest costs. I’ve seen some negative reviews, but I think those people never sorted out the terms. Grasp the nuances in advance!",
      "It is not clear what the operators are guided by when they approve a particular amount. I, for example, approved the amount less than I expected, despite the fact that I do not have a bad credit history. But in general, the service is not so bad. Everything is made out pretty quickly. I can recommend the application.",
      "Hey there. Well, this app is really easy to use, there are no pitfalls. It’s kinda transparent and you can see the repayment amount at once. First, I was worried I could be ripped off or have to pay back more than I expected, but everything was well. No disputes so far!"

      "I have been with Netspend for 4 years. And for the most part been happy. But I gave 1 star due to my experience today. I got a bigger sized credit from a refund we got and all of a sudden I can't use my card or my account. Then we try to call it says the info we put in is wrong so we can't even talk to anyone. App and online pulls up and everything looks fine. This is a nightmare. All the money I have is in that account and I can't touch it. Thanks a lot! Hope ya'll get it fixed soon!",
      "Its a great app. Especially if use the flash pay . money is sent from one card to another instantly no charge but only to other cards whose bank that NetSpend supports. This card has saved me numerous times when I needed money transferred immediately to me. Customer service was excellent handling an issue with monthly fees",
      "I have to at least like this app since I use their prepaid card, but the \"Mobile Check Load\" is horrible. It's problem is that it's Autocapture doesn't capture at all. It complains that it's too dark to take a picture. Despite using a dark background, and trying to keep the phone still, and trying to find a light or nonshade to use to brighten the check, I usually have to manually take the picture. Why can't I manually take the picture to begin with? I could before the last update. Trying to use it today, I had to manually take the picture 13 times to get it accepted at all. Look, if I could afford Hollywood lighting to take a picture of a check, I probably wouldn't need a prepaid card, right? Ingo Money Inc. is very bad.",
      "I have been with netspend for almost 3 years but most recently I can't sign into the mobile app no matter what I do I have had the same username and password forever!!! It's really frustrating and disappointing at times... other then this recent issue it's great!! Hope netspend fixes this ASAP!!!!",
      "Just like other preload Visa's that can be used internationally. Except that sites will suddenly stop accepting and you gotta buy another one. They charge $1.50 a transaction unless u shell out $10 a month. They also have maintenance fees. I don't recommend unless no other choice. If u use with any frequency I'm sure your getting gouged in the long run."

      "Terrible app. Was letting me transfer money all along until one fine day the team decided that they couldn't verify information in my account. So now I can't transfer any more. If the information could not be verified how was i transferring before? Very unreliable. Might stop working right when you need to transfer money urgently. Thankfully there are many other apps that do the same thing, with less headache.",
      "Its was good past 6 years Im using it. It was legit and transaction will be completed right away..you only have to wait a second!!! However, now its either website are slow or you have to wait 5 days before transaction will be completed.. If its going to be like this , might as well use western union or other money remitance If I have to wait that long!",
      "Be careful and make sure your not over paying. No longer using this app unless of an emergency. They keep about 800 pesos after charging me a 5 dollars for fee. 800 pesos is about 40 dollars at the time. So they try to fool costumers thinking it was inexpensive. But at the end of the day they are taking a 45 dollar fee. Very expensive. Other than that for me the app was very easy to use and very handy.",
      "Very slow - a simple 100 EUR transfer from PayPal balance within SEPA took 3 working days to complete. The process feels dated, competing services provide ID verification to speed up transfers setup and often complete transactions within the same day. Fees and exchange rates do not stand out either.",
      "Useless system. They allow you to start a transaction, deduct the funds from your account and then make demands for documents to prove that you actually have the funds in your account before they authorize your transaction. Wasted over 12 hours trying to send money but eventually had to cancel because of their illogical demands. Avoid at all cost."

However, when I try to open the alert, I am constantly told that I am on an unsecured network, and am not allowed any further access. This happens on my personal SECURED wifi, as well as my data service. I have attempted 3 other separate secured Wi-Fi's with zero success. What is the point of the app if we are not permitted to access the account?",
      "Great app. Gives me a great sense of security that my online safety is going to be secure and safe without any threats of theft from any online websites or anything else. I have always trusted the Norton name as the best name in the business when it comes to security measures and reasons involving the World Wide Web and your most sensitive personal and credit card information and other things that matter most to the people who have a personal computer system and a personal email address.",

      "Pretty Good for online Banking. My only issue with Varo is the fact that if you lose your card, your only option is to wait until you get a new one in the the mail which can take up to 14 business day, before you can access your money. Over the counter Cash withdrawal are available at 3rd party vendors/ Banks, but you must have or card.. Which brings me to the point above. Varo savings do offer pretty high yielding APR's on its customers.. Which is cool, , LOANS, loans I say is what I want.",
      "To me this app is very convenient because I never have to go to a bank, I didn't need any money to open the account, It was very simple to set up and it has already helped me get a credit card. My freinds find this hard to believe but its true. I plan on using this app alot.",
      "Best bank I've ever used. Period. I was reluctant to get this because I'd been getting F'd in the A by ridiculous fees from Wells Fargo for years, and didnt want that again. My employers convinced me to go with a bank for efficiency. So I gave this a shot. Not only is it by far the simplest easiest to use bank ive ever encountered, it doesnt buttrape you with fees EVER, and it gets the job done. This app is a breath of fresh air for anyone who's struggled with predatory banks in the past like me",
      "No fees so far, very easy to navigate and transfer money to other accounts!",
      "This is a great way to get paid earlier and as of right now I have not had any issues. I like the fact you can save your change with the round up feature of the debit card. This is one of the easiest to use banking apps I have seen if you a tired of bug banks keeping your money for 2 days on your paycheck deposit to make money from the interest then you need to switch I did and I love it."

My fiancee transferred money wallet to wallet,but after I withdrew on my wallet, it only says waiting authorization(even after 24hours).Went to the place for cash pickup but I was told,there was nothing in their system.After talking to W.R. support for more than 5times they all said they're having tech. difficulty and cant process OUR money! 2 days later, still having trouble??WHERE IS OUR MONEY??",
      "I made my first transaction about two weeks ago and have since made a couple more. For being able to send money internationally, I've not used a better app than this. I'm able to direct deposit or mobile cash or pickup. What I like most of all is the ability to track and that I'm also notified when the money is picked-up. My first transaction had a problem but they worked with me through it all. We corrected the error and completed the transaction. AWESOME SAUCE!!! Keep it up!!!",
      "Needs improvement. I had a problem with trying to pick up a transaction, made 4 trips to the place, emailed and called tech support a few times, and spoke with the local partner and could not get a resolution. Ended up cancelling the transaction and I didn't get a reply to my inquiry on the website. Probably won't use their service again if they don't reach out. Wasted my time and $$$",

Online I did not even find the mobile sending option; I opened account in app: here not even Philippines or UK were in the country list! The help support was not available in chat; by email they sent me instructions just to resend the same inquiry - \"ask the sender\", when the enquiry email was from me, sender. I've time to fix scams. Follow."

Please try again or contact the number on the back of your card for assistance.\" Seriously? I entered the RIGHT password and now it's not working? Is there any way for a deaf person be able to contact the number for assistance? Hmm. I suspect this app is not working properly. Please fix as soon as POSSIBLE!!",

Also, I have never had a card that charged me so damn much for every single transaction ever made it seems. Best to just transfer the funds to a regular account immediately if you actually want to use the child support to support the child instead of US Bank.",

Please update my certificate. Thanks.",

      "Great banking experience, No overdrafts. I get paid 2 days earlier than my coworkers. Their an FDIC bank. Easy online site to navigate. The downside is their isn't a way to get a new card without calling. And they have a $9.95 monthly fee. Which I can live with, since their is no overdrafts. All my coworkers are changing their direct deposit now too.",
      "The app claims to have 24/7 live chat support. I've tried to connect to live support many times at all different hours only to get the \"not available at this time\" message every single time. I used auto fill to sign up, they effed up my address. The app won't let me correct it. Green dot claims you can do a mobile check deposit, but the app won't let me. Perhaps if I could connect to live chat these issues could be resolved. Oh well. Totally worthless app.",
      "I keep getting an error after I log in & do the verification code that's says, “You need to login to your account to check balance!” Which is extremely frustrating because I can't use my card online because of this. I would not recommend this card to anyone. The fees are ridiculous & they lie. To check my balance at an atm, I have to pay 50 cents, which is bullsh*t, it didn't say anything about that!!!",
      "Great, reliable, intuitive. I love the option to make deposits with no transaction fee, simply using a bar code at select locations. Evidently this so cutting-edge that some cashiers don't know how to do it yet, and a manager had to come figure it out. Walmart is the only company I know of that can deposit not only cash, but also from another debit card. You can keep your account locked in your device, but set the app to key you guess your balance without signing in, for quick access.",
      "Bloody awful. You cannot talk to a live person, so don't expect any customer support. Further, the chat feature on the app never works. I bought a card two weeks ago, and I can't even load it. This company is dealing with UOUR money, and they have zero customer support. It is surreal. They never fail to take their monthly fees though."

      "06/12/19, the app worked fine on my note 8 until about 8 months ago. now can't even get past log in. keeps giving error message. why can't they fix the app? As of 03/09/20, I still haven't been able to log in to my acct with the app and I've updated my phone to note 10+. I still give less than 1 star. You can't rate what you can't use.",
      "Loved it at 1st. For the past 3 mths it causes my phone to shut down and freezes my phone. If its not fixed soon I will be moving my account to another bank. I need to see my account on a daily baises and this bug makes it near impossiable. 3 days ago my account was hacked and not caught by the fraud team.",
      "This app was great till the very beginning of January. It wont let me log in anymore and just keeps giving a technical error. I have called tech support and all they were able to tell me to do is delete the app and reinstall it. I did that and it still has the same issue.",
      "Same problems as others. Worked fine until recently. Getting error screen and have to uninstall then reinstall to do anything. Please fix! Also, fingerprint sign in would be great!",
      "Please ENABLE PASTE FUNCTION in the app so that I can copy my password from my secure KeePass app into this banking app. I will not use it until then. I can copy paste using the website so make it possible in the app please. In my opinion, this actually can lead to a less secure app encouraging people to make a more simple password they can remember just so they can use the app. My password is so complicated there is no way I would ever remember it nor would I want to type it out."

I do wish there were more locations thru out Oregon. But im very happy banking here. You can save money on all types of insurance to. So join me and become a member.",

      "Great way to manage and access accounts on the fly! The E-deposit is foolproof and expedient, and overall the app is well put together and user-friendly.",
      "This app has been so helpful for me! It's easy to use and super convenient! Don't have time to drive across town? Do you need to deposit a check? Just sign it, take a couple pictures and by 3pm your deposit has been made. Need to transfer money from savings to checking? Takes less than a minute. Seriously, I timed myself."

      "Unreliable. Sometimes the app work fine, then the next day you can't connect to the servers. This is a problem with the app, because going to Bancanet from the browser works perfectly. I suggest people to use the website as a backup to the app, because while the website works fine, the app is easier to use on a phone.",
      "[Update 3/21/20] Considerably better after recent updates! The fingerprint scanner works as expected, and they added virtual cards for use w/online payments--which I appreciate. Only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is that you still have to physically go to the bank to get your Netkey which is very inconvenient. Double so because the app is not worth using w/o the Netkey. Still, once you get it it's pretty close to the apps from the other banks. Main thing missing for me is the ability to generate a 1 time code to withdraw cash from ATMs w/o using your debit card. Removing 1 start because their customer service is mediocre. Having to wait 20 minutes to call back because the app was apparently logged in is ridiculous.",
      "Too many times and too often is asking to verify the cell phone number registered, its very annoing and after entering the cell phone # I can't use the app for some time and sometimes its urgent to check my balance. Please correct this! Don't say its for my own security, this procedure is above other apps average",
      "Very useful app... But fails often. I assume that's because some functions require open banks or something.",
      "It won't display your numbers till past 24 hours. Horrible bank charges you for past debts like days or weeks after. It doesn't let you authenticate in the app ..you need to waste your time hours and hours in the bank....it sucks"

The Web UI makes this a complete financial app. The only part that's lacking is itemization for investments.",

      "Improving capabilities more and more. Really like the ability to manage recurring bills and income, which helps predict cash flow.",
      "This app could be so good. Lots of potential. It looks great, pretty easy to use. But, There's no customization for the dashboard. I don't want to see my spending year to date I want to see this months spending! It will not let you change anything on the dashboard. Lots of unhelpful information. Plus, my net income is wrong. Idk what is wrong with it but it is missing expenses and all of my accounts are linked to it. A real shame bc the app is very aestheticly pleasing.",

Plus, the pricing for premium isnt ridiculously expensive, so far its worth it, I really recommend this app."

      "This app is great for organizing your budget but there are times when the system doesnt calculate or take all the transactions into place. For instance I saved money this past month and Charlie told me that I didnt save any money. Theres also times when I get payed and it doesnt take that into account. Dont get me wrong I love this app I just feel it can do a bit better in reading all the transactions",
      "This app is great! Only, minor, complaint I have is with the adding bills to the budgetary. I wish there was a way to edit the frequency of bills. I have a bill that I get charged once a week for and another bill that I only get charged every 3 months for. However, the app just assumes that every bill is charged once a month.",
      "I used the messanger app quite a bit, but since installing the actual app, the app doesn't work unless whitelist many tracking domains on my Pi-Hole. If Charlie is FREE and privacy focused why all the trackers?? The app doesn't even work without them. Sounds like once again, my data is the product here. Uninstalling and definitely not recommending to anyone. EDIT: no bug, dev. The app works fine outside my local network that isn't block trackers. Home network w/ DNS tracking disabled it doesn't.",
      "I registered for this service a few years ago on Facebook but never used it. I downloaded the app and decided to give Charlie a chance and he's helpful! What I would love to see more of is to analyze and locate weird purchases or amounts and then ask me about these. Potentially there could be charges from who knows when and if he found something like that for me that'd be Charlie's best feature. I've saw nothing super useful thus far but this service has great potential!",
      "Wish charlie was better are bargaining/reducing bills, fees, and expenses. Would be AMAZING if he was able to negotiate bank fees, try to get them reimbursed. Also, another great feature would be helping with mortgage stuff. Lowering interest rates, negotiating late fees, or maybe if he could give advice like resources for home owners, grants, solar power, ways to get assistance with monthly payments. Tax credits,exemptions Or saving on home/auto insurance without going to a scammy website."

      "I have been using this service for over a year and everything was perfect. My documents were checked and everything was ok with my account.But about a week ago, I wanted to buy bitcoin via a bank account. I linked it through plaid to the uphold account. This is safe and cool. After a day, money is debited from the bank account and immediately block my uphold account! IMMEDIATELY! They do not respond to a request to return my money back. Very similar to SCAM.",
      "Why does the mobile app for my smart phone work better than the same app on my Samsung Tab 4. I have been working on the Tab 4 and the fonts get in the way of my input on the transact line/lines. I want to know why you need 2FA when there are times I sign in on my Tab 4 and you want me to verify again by sending a code to my email. I may have signed in a couple of days before on the same device.",
      "The app is a lot better now so I'm giving it 3 starts. However it still needs some work, the app should have the same menu options like the website. Please keep working on it to make it better. After the updates I'm now opening it more often now.",
      "not user-friendly.. not easy to understand how to transfer crypto.. you could have made it with the usual send/recieve;copypaste; withdraw/deposit. you don't need innovation when it comes to money transfer because a single mistake is equivalent to losing money. you need to revert the transaction to usual crypto transaction. until then i consider reinstalling.. so for now, sorry to uninstall this useless app.. thanks!",
      "Wow this app has come a long way since the beginning! The UI has been revamped and is now much easier to navigate. I'm super happy that debit card support is available now so I can transfer funds instantly! The ability to exchange crypto with real-world currencies on the fly is just absolutely awesome! I haven't experienced any bugs or issues so I hope it's smooth sailing from here :)"

      "I love it here on Quick Loan~! WOW. Absolutely no complaints here!! honestly i absolutely adore this app!! No lines or constant need for providing the same info again and again. You get instant funding to a debit card (you can choose any option). Also, some apps don't operate in my country. I've also recommended to several friends (in need) to try it out and they loved it as well. Quick Loan is the real deal!",
      "It's amazing on Quick Loan how much you can view your records, it also sets future budgets for you, you can make loans and get free insurance quotes plus there credit repair system is excellent Quick Loan is legit. Also Quick Loan is a good service if you're looking to see what you have available out there for you, and also to get a estimated glance of your credit score. However, when you're looking for an online quote from a certain service, as soon as you complete the form, you will be absolutely relentlessly bombarded with auto dialed calls. This is very inconvenient if you are in a work setting or a place where this is inconvenient",
      "I love this app!! The money is always there when I need it. The support chat is great very little waiting for a response, and issue was resolved quickly. If your looking for a reliable app when your low on dough, this is it. The payments are automatically withdrawn from my account, and within 2 day O can borrow again if I need to. I love it!!",
      "So awesome! Honestly I was pretty sceptical at first, but this app has helped so much!!! It's really amazing, and 10 billion times better than a Payday loan. I love that we pay what we think is fair, I love the community. I have rarely had any issues, but the few times I do, I've been able to chat with support through the app, and they never fail to impress me. They are very knowledgeable and fix the issue very quickly! Couldn't recommend this highly enough to help between paydays",
      "Quick Loan is the best app and place to go for borrowing money! it REALLY does work. The loan itself is made literally in two clicks, the money comes quickly and most importantly at a small percentage. Quick Loan is a very important and necessary thing. The application is simple, but very functional. Works without complaints. I myself often use it when there is absolutely no money. Everything is simple and convenient, no problems. In reality, an online loan helps to choose the right company for"

      "Every time you update your Android you need to reconfigure everything (since 2017). This does not happens with any other bank in Mexico. Now I'm having issues with the BBVA Token (after I upgraded to Android 10), the app gets stuck trying to reach a server and won't let me sign in to my bank accounts. BBVA support ask me to Uninstall all my from the Bank, now everything is fu*ked. All the apps now open then there's this black screen showing that the Apps have crashed..",
      "This is the worst app in Mexico. On January the system had an error. i always transfer my money by app but on January 7th, I noticed a charger \"serv banca internet/ops serv bca in\" plus IVA. I'm seeing that the last updated is few days ago. I created an ticket but this bank cannot give me a resolution. Do not create account, ask for loan or credit .. avoid to loose your money without explanation or excuse 😑",
      "The app is stuck in the token activation screen. I keeps sending emails stating that it has been successfully activated without allowing me to access my information. This has been a recurring problem.",
      "It should have access to finger print security access! It is such a deal having to log in.",
      "App stopped working asking/enforcing to configure movile token while i already had it.. tha app was cycled evry try as a result didnt let me log in.... afther some days of frustration decided to reinstall the app ... now during the registration is cycled enforcing to register face recognition even that i don like it, enforces you to do it.. but worst that is cycle all the time .. and still not able to log in..."

      "Over all this app is so much easier than all the others and every option it gives you it gives a definition to go along with it. They also so you what you need to look forbid anything is missing or doesn't make sense. This the most effective and efficient app I've ever used. Thank you so much H&R Block.",
      "Sucks! Tried to charge me 49.99 to use a deduction. I tried to delete the deduction 10 times because i was trying to just do a standard deduction. Keeps popping up to fix issue. I kept going around and round fix delete fix delete! Then i went to help chat. Wait time 10 minutes , ok then app timed out kicked me out of spot inline, tried again sorry problem with live chat over and over again! Finally agreed to 49.99 then during checkout extra 45 for state so free means 94.95 u suck hr block!",
      "Easy to use with no hidden fees until the end like other tax apps, it discusses prices upfront and is completely free if you choose the right options unlike other apps that you click free and end up paying $150 when its all said and done. The app is very helpful and has answers for any question you may have on the spot instantly for you to access, plus they help you get every deduction possible. I highly reccomend this app to EVERYONE. Its definetly everything needed and more!",
      "This was the first time I filed my taxes by myself. I was really nervous. But they made it so easy. Plus they have extra services to make sure you didn't make a mistake or to protect you if you did make a mistake for pretty cheap. I'm really glad i got this app.",
      "Easy to use, my first filing myself and felt at ease. In some sections, I wish there were more options to file mileage and some other items. Other than that, my experience was great."

      "I really hate this app and card service in general. I need to get switched over to Chime. It's not so cheap. I understand with the COVID 19 outbreak, lines are either busy or down. But I'm locked out of my online account after trying to use my CORRECT password (kept saying it was wrong even though I've NEVER changed it.) I think it has something to do with me activating my new card since my old expired. Still doesn't make sense, but that's the literally the only thing that's changed recently.",
      "Only2for the app. It's sucks. But, I use the Rapid app thru my Google Chrome app. And have no troubles or get that dumb ass error message when I try to use the Rapid app by it self. Without go thru my(I'm not sponsored or getting paid, in any way or form. To mention their name or the name of any Apps)Google chrome account app. The only place I have got the app to work is on a unlock Wi-Fi network at my workThats open to the public and not safe to use on for apps like this one. Hope this helps.",
      "This P. O. S. app is 99% worthless! I have a fully updated perfectly functioning Note 9, and after months of ONLY being able to view my total balance - and nothing more, we've come to this - nothing more than their F'n logo appears followed by an error message.... W... T... F!? How am I supposed to trust a bank that doesn't even understand how to keep an app compatible with one of the most popular phones on the market? Much less security of my funds?",
      "Created an account but it timed out while finalizing it. Now it says theres an error telling me I already have an account. so I go to loggin in with the info I used to make the account, and it gives me another error saying I've enter info incorrectly. I requested to see what my password, and the temporary password given to me didnt work. I tried requesting a new temporary password, and again still didnt work. Looks like I'm not getting paid today. Im already extremely unhappy with the service.",
      "Wow@!!! I've had my account with rapid for almost 5 years now and the app is the worst!! So many bugs and glitches. I was trying to locate ATM and everytime I hit locators the app would close. And now a couple days later I can't even open the app that I just updated. And you guys say you fixed bugs on this update"
