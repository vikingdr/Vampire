      "The old version of the app was better. The new version does not let you redeem emailed coupons (from surveys etc) in the app. Seems like fewer coupons and offers pop up in the app than they used to. It also takes a long time (a couple business days?) to load rewards points from the power card onto the app. Also fewer options of specific $ amounts to reload the power card in-app, than in-store. Better than nothing but could be better!",
      "The app is already pretty bad as it is, but they need to change the image they use for the tiny Notification bar. I was literally getting frustrated this morning because I couldn't find what I thought was a Shell Gas notification so I could clear the icon, but it turned out to be a spam notification from this app. That's another thing D&B, there's a difference between a notification and an ad. My notification bar is not your billboard!",
      "Glitchy as hell! It takes forever to load your card on the app...even when connected to WiFi. I lhad to uninstall and install the app several times, upload Google Pay and a credit card and finally after hours of messing with it, I got to reload my card. I have no issues with processing payments on any other app except this one. I doubt my info is even secure. Looks and acts like someone with no experience developed it.",
      "I mainly downloaded this app bc of the 30% off your first purchase, however after going through and paying and getting my points, I couldn't use my phone as the digital game card. I've used my phone's nfc for many of purchases in the past so I knew it worked. Kinda disappointed bc I got my friends to download it and it worked for them. Had to go wait in line to get my points transferred onto a card. Kinda defeated the purpose of \"skipping the line\"",
      "Really appreciate the first time 50% off coupon but afterwards there is never any offers. Literally never any new offers afterwards. Old version was better. I didn't go to Dave and buster's for 6 months because full price recharge is not enough gameplay. Unless I spend 50 or 100 which is too expensive. Can you put a buy 20 get 20 free please? At least 1 last time?"

      "This is a very tough and good obstacle game, but it‚Äôs just super boring. I don‚Äôt know what is bothering me but I get bored all the time. Especially when they are just bots playing. I want to play in multiplayer when you are online. Or, there will be options whether you wanna be multiplayer, or single player. Other than that, this is a great game! ^^",
      "This game is sooo amazing.Just started playing and now I can't stop playing.And I don't care about the adds.As long as I üòç this game.So if there was a trillion stars,I will rate a xillion stars.Keep up the great work on FunRace 3D.üòçüòçüòçüíùüíùüíùüé†üé†üé†üé†üè©üè©üéâüéâüéâ",
      "I loved this game. Well, all until i had to reset my phone. When i had my account and everything on my phone i downloaded this again and it started me over but i wasnt to worried because i knew i can account back any time i wanted. But then, it started lagging, and glitching, and doinh things it wanted too. So when i tried to get my account back, everytime i clicked it, it did nothing. I dont recommend.",
      "At first the game was really fun and I really liked it and it was great how you could customize your person, but then one time I tried playing it and I opened up the app it restarted and I couldn't start from the level I was at. I tried going intosettings and pressing the restart button but it just didn't work. üò£‚òπÔ∏èüòñ",
      "It doesn't move when you make it move, it's slow and wastes time thus making one lose a game and it will be like that for like two to three games before one could win a particular game to move to the next round and it's unfair that the computer competitors always win by cheating, then what's the fun of the game if one has difficulties moving in the game and also having cheating opponent?. I hope that the game company takes this matter seriously and do something about it."

      "The game is good but there's a few problems with it. 1st of all you can kill yourself with your own traps which is dumb. Secondly, the arena will eliminate u as soon as it senses that u are losing badly. And finally, some of the maps are way too crazy. Besides those flaws the game is pretty good.",
      "I was just casually scrolling through the app store for a game when I came across this app. I used to play it all the time back in 2017, so i considered downloading it to see if it improved..So I did, opened the app, and I was sent to a race right away. The controls were hard, it had blood and guts in it. It's a pretty fun and enjoyable game. I dont reccomend it to kids under the age of 8 though..",
      "So far I'm on bronze l, and I already love the game! I've only played for 1 single day. I like how making a clan isn't super expensive, like in other games. This is also a way to do something when you're bored. Although, the quick plays, I cant get over how I think they're bots. There only lvl 4 and on silver already. It surprises me. But, still love the awsome game.",
      "The Game Is great but to support you I think you should change or look into this. When I click watch ad, it just says loading and I wait 15 seconds just staring at the loading screen. The ad button works 50/50 most of the time but I'm just wondering if that is supposed to happen. Thanks for making a game my friends and I can play :)",
      "Good game but PLEAAAAASE make all maps available for normal races! You only race on the same few maps over and over yet there are so many more that can only be used during custom races. Like swimming maps etc. Let us race on those in normal races too. Gets so boring and repetitive running on the same maps all the time. Edit: those maps are now available during all races so thanks so much for that!! Changed my rating to 5. Highly addictive game"

I could tell because of how 1. It only took an instant to find a match 2. The exact same noob profile photo and taunts as me and 3. The lag; there was delay for the opponents reactions. The bots are not like this, basically being identical to training mode. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars"

      "The reason i gave it one star was because of it's stupid ads \"oh look at me creating the game like there's no tomorrow\" stupid i tried to get the camera working but Noooo no matter how much you try it won't work deleted this game never installing it agen.",
      "From installing the app it took me about 30 seconds to realize this is rubbish. Tip:if you get stuck on the app and can't get to your home screen, hit the volume button on your phone and then settings. Go to the search function and search for apps. Find this app and uninstall"

      "fun to play, but some in game free spins are very underwhelming. edit, you need to fix the challenge, i hit big win twice and did not get the \" reward or move on to the next level, i was playing the required amount of coins, and this is not the first time this had happened. started as a 5 star game has been declining",
      "Lots of awesome games! Lots of fun! Always something different and big bonuses! Always a good time! These games are great, but it gets real annoying when your trying to play and it keeps asking you to give them a rating. Other than that, no complaints. Still 5 Star!! 3-1-20...My review remains the same, love all the different games, hours of fun, and still 5 star! Decided to comment again so it would quit asking me too, very annoying. 3-6-20...still fun.",
      "HOF games are fun but I'm not enjoying it much as I did when I first began playing HOF. I no longer play the Daily Rush game, the challenge, daily. The first part is ok but it is in 3 parts. A couple times I have completed the 2nd part but I don't think I ever completed the 3rd part. HOF doesn't tell us how to play to win, it's depressing to loose over and over but it sure is fun to win! House of Fun, please be kind to those who play the game.",
      "I've always given Hof five stars and 2 Stars cuz I'm very disappointed. Reason being took away boost activated and I was a couple points of making Platinum before the year was out. And for the third year in a row I had to start over I'm getting disinterest in the game as it goes on. And I will not put any more money into it. I should be platinum I've been playing five years now. Very disappointed only game I play is this game.",
      "Best slots around, doesn't take all your coins real fast like other slots, actually letting me play free for long time now since I started. Games are very exciting and a pleasure to look at, so many varieties, gives free coins and gifts very often and not stingy about it. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose and I know you will love it. Still playing and it only gets better"

      "Honestly it was a great time killer and overall amazing! The adds really don't bother me because I know how to fix that, so if you are worried about adds, you can turn off your Wifi, and then it can't load. That should fix your problems with adds. The developers did a great job!",
      "this app is ok. üëåbut every time I want to change ropes is always has an add!!!! and sometimes I just get really mad. üò° but other then that I think this an amazing mind stimulating game and it helps open the mind and solve things ur self! or just get a friend to make a knot on a shoe and untye it!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ"

      "Overall its a really fun game the only problem was after I colored a number space I had to go to another section where you cant see the number space I just colored and wait for 10 seconds before it lets me color another space. Other than that its the best game ever and is so fun.",
      "I have seen many forum for this type and only rate it fair for general public. For older citizens it is great or if young ones it is good. I'm 67 and do real coloring as well as these kind of apps. I much prefer color planet and happy color. More effort needed, smaller pieces and more complicated. Thanks for listening, Roxi Pallas",
      "I love this game but there needs to be harder pics to do so please fix that. My first reason that it's a good game becues it's really relaxing. I hope you think it's relaxing. It's a good game so please install this app it's soooooooooo relaxing üòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòá;-);-);-)",

      "The game is interesting. I got all the way to epic... The only problem is I played more ads than I did the game to get there from the very beginning of my download, and because of that I will delete this app before ever giving it a real chance. You want people to pay for no ads? Reduce the current ad rate and people might pay for it more often instead of hitting the uninstall button.",
      "The bots sucks not gonna lie. The problem is that there is no music and sound effects and the bots will NOT move until i moved and they want me to get 1st place which is boring!! And the levels sometimes repeat. And it's not even challenging and easy to play. I'll give 2 star for a good obstacles.",
      "At the beginning of the game(first two levels) I was doing just fine then as the game went on and on They started CHEATING in the LEVEL with the BALL PINS swirling around and stuff..just to be clear I DOWNLOADED this game TODAY and DELETED this game TODAY..lol literally WASTED my SPACE",
      "This game was fun until i had to reinstall it. Now the control lags and only race against 1 person instead of 2. Also will not respond when trying to watch videos. Wish there was an option to create account so when you either get a new phone or have to reset it you wont lose your progess",
      "Entertaining but again. An ad after every round. It even gives you the option, ad for gold? No thanks. Ok well, here's an ad. Want a prize? Watch an ad. No thanks ok well no prize, here's an ad."

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn't do any good. I have waited through 3 updates for it to be worked out so I think I'm done.",

      "The game itself is fine. My issue is with the ridiculous amount of ads, almost all of which run for 30 seconds and then generste a second ad that runs for an additional 15 seconds before you can close it. An ad will play after almost any action you take and sometimes they will just play without you actually doing anything. Worst of all is that the game also keeps asking me to take some NRA survey. All of this ruins an otherwise decent game.",
      "I like this game so far. Tier11. 1.There is an ad after almost every mission/pvp/worldops round. 2. During world ops I kill a group, but their is another person shooting at me from somewhere I can't see, thus I can't kill them and then I don't get my world ops tokens worth for that round bc they kill me first. Same thing during pvp, I can't see someone, but they can see me and I die first. Please fix it. 3. Always trying to get you to buy stuff. \"Special offers\" cost more than what you got.",
      "Fun game.Not to many guns you have to work your way up to. I only play the free version. It would be a 5 star game if you didn't let people use cheats. It seriously sucks the fun right outta the game. I've worked my way up, watching ADS for free Diamonds, completed every primary and spec ops mission, even get offered higher tier guns for completing mission so quick, but it wont let me buy because I haven't got to that city yet. Please stop the free coin for users that dont appreciate a real game",
      "The game is fun and graphics are great but every time you do anything at all they try to get you to purchase stuff. I even signed up for premium and still have to purchase things to continue playing. Oh, and they put your diamonds you win during missions in a \"piggy bank\" so you can't use them until they say you can, unless you pay real money to open the \"piggy bank\" early. And you need the diamonds for upgrades and weapons. Also, after all the waiting, you have to pay 2.99 to open piggybank",
      "I've made purchases of $170.00 in gems this month, was playing WOPS, and when I came out of the round, my Gem count was reduced by a total of 36,000 gems, the equivalent of over $100.00. That was four days ago and I've yet to hear back from support. Is this a \"good game\"? You do the math... It's been over three weeks and still no word back from support."

      "I love it so so so much. The controls are really easy, the flow of the game is great, the pictures are awesome. I love how you can choose the pictures in whatever order you want, it's nice because sometimes I don't have time or energy to complete one of the most complicated pictures, so I just go and choose a more simple one and can still play without getting stuck in the harder ones.",
      "I have absolutely adored the app since I downloaded it days ago. The only improvements I would suggest are featuring an option to pay for the removal of ads and then to fix moving an image. Using two fingers, you can move the picture, but zooming occurs at the same time. This could be fixed by installing a feature that could sort of bounce between moving and coloring. So one finger could be used to scroll the image. If these could be fixed, I'll happily re-vote to 5 stars.",
      "I love this scroll down the street as you color it. I chose easy mode to get used to it. Trying to figure out how to invite friends. Just starting so my rating may change. So far so good and fun. UPDATE - I have finished all the streets of the game and I can't wait until new ones come out. 5 stars still as of February 2020. Ty for so much fun.",
      "When I first downloaded this game it was pretty relaxing and enjoyable. Now with the new update I'm getting so many ads I'm more than likely deleting this app. What a shame. Edit: yeah I get, a lot of free games give the option of ads, I mean, every time I try to go to a new painting I have to watch one? The frequency is what kills me. Not just the fact that it's an ad.",
      "This game is fun but.... The game freezes. When I finish a picture and go to color more, the screen freezes. I have to exit the app then reenter for me to color more. I have to do this all the time. Please fix this."

      "Here's how you really got to play this game. In the tutorial don't start your village. You can wonder around in the village they show you at the intro. Great way to understand that building is limitless. So after falling down their well. You can start your village. But don't buy anything yet. The game allows you to build with unlimited blocks, until you buy your first building. Wait till you get your building experience down then buy. And you can get 500 gems for free. Happy Building",
      "I like the app .I am really writing this to complain about the villagers,they are SUPER ANNOYING I can't build anything without them getting in the way! I built a big house but its empty, all because I cant put things in it without them teleporting in to my house!!!! Most of my village they can go to but there are like 2 building that are private wich are my house and my pool. They already have there own pool! So I went FAR but there still teleporting there. Take there teleporting ability away!",
      "I really love this game! It's just like Minecraft but a little different. But I have some things I wish would be in the game... First of all, can there be like a daily reward? I wish that would happen.. I'm really broke. Secondly, I would recommend gaining XP while your in the game, you can only get XP when you are building something from the workshop, and you need gems to buy them. How are you going to get gems if your broke? Well, there is the Free Gems thing but it only gives you 2 gems.",
      "This game is really fun!!! You get to build whatever you want... on level three you only have 150 of every block and the animals and stuff you have to buy them with your gems. If you want to build something big and you run out of blocks you ethier have to watch a video of use your gems.",
      "The experience is great. You don't only build your own city but you can build what you please! Most tell you to make your own world how you would like but, How do you do that without showing you how to play? This doesn't only do that but Even after it they put up a guide to build. I Just press the house until I'm done. You can do that to because if you have a different block then what you put down it Puts down the correct one on your build. This was a great alternative to Minecraft. Thx!!! üíìüíì"

      "It's my favorite app/game of all time and I would give it 5 stars if a) it was truly multi-player (instead of bots) and b) the ongoing lag issues that make navigation awkward and sometimes impossible (if you accumulate a large number of members, which is the point) was fixed for good. Paying to go ad-free is worth it, but the speed issues ruin it.",
      "The game is fun for about ten attempts and then it gets extremely repetitive. There's only one level to play and the rounds are only two minutes long. The short time period makes it impossible to recover if you get attacked once, and there were several times I ran around trying to attack people but just couldn't find them in the time given. Aside from the gameplay you have to watch an ad after every single two minute round. It's fun to play for a few minutes but tries too hard to be slitherio",
      "I like this game because it is really satisfying to play. But sometimes when I open the app, the whole game just hangs. On the other hand, ads aren't a problem for me. I just turn off my internet, and I can play with no problem, making it ad-free. Other than the problems in the game, it's still really good!",
      "I love it but Not being able to SCORE HIGHER points Sucks! Please add a (LEADERSHIP Board), ways to earn more points with coins or giants or something to get higher scores. I also wish I could HEAR and change sounds, adjust several time options ( 5, 10, 15) minutes spent on the board, opt out of ADS, FEEL vibrations, change speeds by double tapping or something, go into tunnels, up ramps, e.t.c.",
      "The only issue with the game is the timing what i think..... One can play the game until he is not dead or all other players are not dead this timing concept is very irritating..... When we start enjoying the game the timer comes in between which is frustrating.... Hope the developer will consider it"

      "Fun game, could be better. Very good graphics 7/10, Magnificent gameplay and storylines 11/10. To improve the game I recommend adding more campground stuff, maybe a sliding map to add the stuff that the flash version had. I also recommend adding more levels to the underground storage, and putting more of the 2018 & 2017 campaigns up for purchase. I really want to finish the superhero campaigns. Also, a half-off week for underground clearing would be most appreciated.",
      "This is one of the best STILL FREE Mine Crawler games out there. Let's be real. It doesn't give you some of the instant gratification that most current games do. This Game is LITERALLY the definition of start small and BUILD. The very fact the Devs are coming out fresh NEW content, and it's ALL FREE is something to be applauded. Start playing, get about 5-10 levels in and you wanna see what happens next. üíñ this game.",
      "No idea how I found this game but what a blast it is. I just get confused how it sends you all over but when you look at the map it shows a certain area wasn't completed before it sends you to another area. But it is fun and so far the algorithm of the game is fair when it comes to energy etc. Created account but not sure it linked. You'd think it'd give us a prize or something. How do I know my stuff will be saved? Created an account through a Facebook link on your page?",
      "A fun time killer. I enjoy the mini strategy games strewn throughout the levels. I find it's a great mind numbing game to use for bed time and even enjoy it enough to play during my awake hours. They do a good job of offering assistance through their website if you get stuck on a puzzle because you def have to infer what's needed on more than a few puzzles. I kind of enjoy the fact that it makes you work harder to figure it out. Def a fun download.",
      "I like it. I haven't paid for anything and am not feeling frustrated w waiting for my energy returns. There are plenty of opportunities to earn improvements to increase the pace of production and capacity of energy storage, as well as making foods to restore energy immediately. There are lots of fun, resource rich events. It's a good game."

      "It's a really fun and it will make the time go by faster if your bored. I downloaded it a week ago and I have been playin ever since everyday for like 1 hour atleadt. Especially at school when I have free time it's a good time waster to make it seem like you haven't waited at all. Download it and try it for yourself and u will see what I'm talkin about . I had a 500 word limit and dont know what else to sayüò≠üò≠üòÇthat's why it sounds",
      "It is pretty good but there is the get coins if u watch an ad and you get 180 coins then when you get a certin amount of coins you get a free bike. I used to be able to watch them continously and then once i stopped watching them they would disappear for a day then i would get them back now i can only use them twice and they disappear for a day plz fiz this!",
      "It's a decent game for the gameplay side. But the tournaments are completely broken. You cant get a 3+ star bike. You just cant. To evolve a bike to be 3 stars you need to get the old school bike. The problem is, the old school bike doesnt exist. You cant get it through 2 star bike races, and the chances of a special game for it is 0.0000001%, not joking, that only occurs once a month. The best part is, you only get 1 out of 4 parts per win. You can of course cheat the game by paying. Of course.",
      "I played this a long time ago and really enjoyed it. Downloaded it again and suddenly got a \"$5 gift card\" to use. One of the bikes were on sale at just below $5 so I guessed I would get it for free, but no, they charged me instead. The amount isn't the problem, but it's a disgusting way to make money by blatantly lying, not cool.",
      "Ashamed. I used to play this when very young and this was amazing. Now when i just played this i came back to see every bike \"Vip\" which you have to pay monthly for when you could just earn by completing tasks back in the day. This game became money hungry and not fun anymore"

      "Honestly, it's a good game that I have always enjoyed in the past. My thing is that I don't recall there ever being this many ads before. I'm not faulting this game for trying to make money with ad revenue but I am faulting how they've implemented it. I noticed that there is now an option to watch an ad and get a hint. My problem lays in that I will get unskippable 30 sec ads after I complete a puzzle with out touching the option for watching a video to get a hint. It takes away from the game.",
      "At first when my daughter introduced me to Free Flow, I must admit, I was reluctant. However, after watching how much she was enjoying the game, I became curious. Needless to say, at this point, it has become my favorite game. I am 71yrs old and I've been playing for quite some time now. By the way, I had accumulated over 440 hints which disappeared overnight. What happened?",
      "A really good puzzle game that I have spent many hrs playing, so good that I paid for the extra levels and I don't normally pay for anything extra, I have played the other Flow Free games and enjoyed them too and I like the challenge as the levels get harder and would recommend this to anyone who's searching for a really good puzzle game üëç",
      "Game is wonderful... My only concern with it is that most of these levels are WAYYY too easy... Even the \"beginner\" levels should be slightly more challenging.... Or you should give the player the option to replay the levels but on a harder difficulty, just a idea for the future... But as someone who loves puzzels like these ones i would like it to be more challenging",
      "Did rate it 5* but recently they've added a ridiculous number of long unskippable ads - they're every 3 games or so, which is usually less than a minute! Was such a good game but it's basically unplayable now :( EDIT: Seem to have stopped the unskippable ads again so back to 5*! Seriously addictive game, challenging enough to be interesting without being so hard it's frustrating!"

      "It is good but a few things need changing. Firstly remove the featurr when you cant send a text you need to resend it and wait for their wifi to be good and autosend it. Next, add language rooms : so like you pick a language then you get picked into that language, with that add multiple languages. Next, please add group chats, it really gets on my nerves without it. Can you make loading easier because it sometimes doesnt work : like I cannot load ? Finally, fix joining friends groups.",
      "Hangs a lot doesn't work properly as well as abusers + chat portion is not working properly 2nd time I made account as I loved the app but stil lots of problems",
      "This game was very unopen to gay/lesbian people. When you want to increase your chances, they do not allow you to do that with the same gender. They wont even let the bottle land on you. Maybe they could add a feature where you can go to a gay or lesbian community. Besides that it is an okay game."

      "I have just started using this app. I love that you can create your own designs (mandalas,flowers)and there is a very wide selection of colors. I am using a trial of the paid app ($5.99/week) or ($24.00/month) so I don't know whether the free version has annoying ads. I will have to report back in a month or so to see if it is worth $24.00 . Note: I have limited drawing skills, and have mostly done coloring books or coloring apps. So far, this is good for a beginning artist.",
      "Good game, but this coloring app is like drawing book, when giving color we must use our imagination, approximately what color is suitable for the image that we want to color. That's not easy, so this game is made for those who want to be creative with colors that match the picture. The overall of this game is great, with more editing to make picture look beautiful. This very-very different from others, but it's not suitable for me :)",
      "I would give it more stars if almost everything you would have to pay for and it makes it just boring I think they need to add more to the free stuff and not the paying stuff because one day all the free ones are going to be all done and have to make your own but your bad at drawing if it didn't have so much stuff you had to pay for I would give it five stars :(",
      "I tried to cancel payment for the app but can't find a way. Uninstalling only takes it off phone, it doesn't cancel the charges either. I liked the app well enough but only wanted to try the free week, yet won't let me opt out. Charging my card either way unless I cancel my card so they can't take payments. What a hassle! DEFINITELY NOT worth all the effort just to use the free week trial. When you sign up,says you can cancel anytime before payment, but there's no way to do it when you try :(",
      "The reason for the 2‚òÜs is simply because there's not enough free options. I'm thinking hard about uninstalling this app, which is a shame because I'd love to be able to color most of what's made in here to color. However..... $10 a week is too much right now for me and outsode of that, I don't see how it's worth that right now with the extreme limited free options. More than likely, I'll be uninstalling after I color all the free options...."

      "The reason why I'm giving this game 2 stars is because of the monetization model. The game tries to force you into buying 'membership' and the amount of ads appearing is unbelievable. Other than that, it's a very basic clicker game.",
      "The reason why I rate it five star is because in the game it shows real people and that game shows money guns and gold money and you get to upgrade your character and I like the music in the background and when he says let's get it and I like the bosses because if you click fast enough you get all of the stars the the bosses give you that is why I rate it 5 stars",
      "It a OK game. I rate it 3 star because. TOO MANY FREAKIN ADS! Like I could rate it 1 star but I didn't because this game to me is really fun but every time I reach a new level. It gives me a ad..but all and all its a good game and also sometimes it gives me a black screen so I had to restart my phone for it to go away. So it's a good game but way too many ads, glitchy (sometimes) and it keeps giving me a black screen. But like I said. It's fun and a good game. So I rate this game a three star!!!",
      "This game seems like it would be fun, I understand why games have ads; what I don't understand is why in the world it's acceptable to have ads in the middle of game play. Not after levels, but multiple long @$$ ads in the middle of playing, like every 9secs or so. Uninstalling.",
      "This game is dumb. I was thinking it was a fun choice game in all the ads that pop up, when I got it it was a waste of time waiting for it. Why would you make the ads different then the game already is? I only have it still because I was thinking once you reach a a point in the game you get story mode. But nope it's just a DUMB taping game!"

The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it needs other things to do on it like creating your own pics or giving you a word and a selection of images where you have to choose 2 pics that match. Although overall great game.",

      "Just 2 pics hot + dog = hotdog At first it's annoying but afterwards you will be able to understand everything and I gave it 4 star because of this and I play this game a lot and it deserves at least a 3 star, 4 star, 5 star and do not just delete it wait for like three days or four days",
      "I think its a 4 because some times you just cant figure it out because it is eather to confusing or it is too hard it is fun to play but i think it would be better if they wernt as hard or as confusing ..... But anyway thank you for letting try this experiance and thank you for helping me to consentraite better and it really made me think like if you are the same xxxx these kind of games are tricky but there fun xxxxxxxxxxxx see you later aligator in a while crocadile xxxx byeeeeeeeeeee........",

      "The game is fun but there are a lot of glitches, Selina's special power tends to glitch the character out when unfreezed, most of the time where I want to adopt pets or check events, I would keep getting the \"connection error\" message every single time though my Internet is perfectly fine, I've tried closing and opening the app again but it's still like that, I advice making more maps so that we can have more fun instead of playing the same thing",
      "This game is bugged I can't join my friend even though I have him in friend list now the friend list also doesn't work I can't get invites or my friend and it says I'm offline even though I am online please fix this.this game deserves a 5 star but this bug/glitch is really making me mad üò†",
      "I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!! It's so amazing and it's very entertaining... Although i think this is a glitch.. I put the frequent flyer on the Eagle Koobird but i can't unequip it. The button is gray. I put it on the bird on mistake now i can't take it off.. But idc anymore its a unique glitch. I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS GAME OMG THERE R EVEN TRAILS?!? Tysm for this amazing game‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üíï‚ù§‚ù§üíï‚ù§üíïüíï‚ù§",
      "It logs you out sometimes that's an issue the other one is that sometimes it dont let you accept your friends invitation the rest of the game is fine just fix that because that's really irritating.",
      "I really wanted to play for my first time.. I click on the app to start to play and it loads quickly but suddenly stops at 80%.. Seriously?! I try again for the second time. Again! I reinstall it and AGAIN this app is not working AT ALL..DO NOT USE!! Wasted my time to install this.. I hate this game. WARNING: DO NOT INSTALL."

      "The games are entertaining and fun but there is no way to earn gems. I would change this by 1 let us use the stars that we earn to buy gems or 2 when we complete a level/pack we earn a certain number of gems. I also think you should add a word game where you just give us one word and then we have to find a certain number of other words in it and the harder the level the more words we have to find.",
      "I've been playing the game for some time now and while I was not at first impressed, it has grown on me - I still think that the money given or earned is not enough to make the game as interesting or smooth as it could be, but it's a great game nonetheless!",
      "UPDATE: After playing a while the ads start coming more frequently, those horrible horrible ads that you hit the X and it takes you straight to play store to download the stupid game they're advertising instead of back to the game... Do this about 5 times for each ad BECAUSE IT WONT LET YOU GET BACK TO GAME for SEVERAL MINUTES. I'm so sick of those kind of ads... UNINSTALLING",
      "Game runs smoothly. Easy concept of how to play the game. It is a bit challenging even on the 1st couple of levels. Which i think should have started out a little easier, but It is fun to play and builds your brain üíÅGreat Job guys!",
      "I loved it ! I wish I could keep playing games like these . It's amazing how much fun your having that when it ends your left with wishing for more! Thanks for a great game of words . Keep up the great work and I hope you create more word games I can play !"

      "Graphics of almost a comic book feel is really nice. However I find it hard to see how this is an escape game? Every level is just one little puzzle in one layout facing the door, theres no panning around a room as such. No collecting items and combine them with puzzles and yet most of these are just riddles? I'm sorry and just my opinion, its boring. However the ads aren't that bad. Every few levels, yes there is an ad but you can click away as fast it popped up so there you have it I guess.",
      "Puzzles are decent - they just have nothing to do with opening doors, except the ones where you enter the answer on a keypad. So not a bad \"escape\" game but not an outstanding one either.",
      "The clues and graphics were good .However i only got to level 23. I was sick of all the ads. I have never played an escape game were you run out of energy? I am uninstalling.",
      "Really liked the game but when I went to upload the video for enery I was stuck on another game to load and didn't get my lightening. Don't want to wait ten minutes to play a ten second game",
      "Very well put together, simple game. I would say don't get this game expecting it to be a challenge. It's more of a kids game. But a very good kids game."

The operating system is easy to understand, doesn't mess with the operation of the overall phone, and just a great app. I absolutely suggest you to get this, 10/10",

Your app is only for certain phones...then you should state that before people install.....uninstalling for the second time."

      "Used to be my go to app for calls with family and friends. However, after the last update, I cannot connect my Bluetooth headphones to the app any more. I do a lot of commute and connecting to my Bluetooth headphones was always an awesome experience. Not anymore I'm afraid. Everytime I make call the app would switch from Bluetooth to speaker as soon as my call was answered. Please fix this issue! I'm bound to use other apps with mediocre calling experience until this issue is fixed.",

      "First off, do you really have to have an ad after EVERY SINGLE ROUND? And on the menu, too??? The game was overall pretty glitchy, and you can tell you aren't playing with real people because if you are super far ahead from everyone else the leaderboard already has the stats. Another thing: why are the girl and boy as well as the bystanders all white? The game itself was pretty boring.",
      "So many ads. After every level there is an ad. There is just way too many and it's really annoying. And it's just a bad game in general. Like, who would make a game about water slides and making you jump across them just to come first and some of the a.i names are weird. I was playing and it said the names were princess,pirate,sniper,deathbeast and worst of all the name pro in all caps. There that's my review. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IS BAD IN MY OPINION! Just take it from me.",
      "As we all know, It's obvious by now we are all playing with bots. When you get Far away from everyone, the \"Players\" Teleport to you and don't even try. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE FAILED BECAUSE OF THIS. Also I see the same people like every two rounds. Like, \"Dad\", \"Bae\", and imagineYOU. Seriously, What is your reputation Aquapark.io? I have even told my siblings MULTIPLE times, \"I think people are just getting paid to act like their players\".. And Ofcourse I was right. Bye.",
      "I like this app! Although there are some pros and cons. Pros are, I like the design of this game and it's pretty addicting. Cons, most of the computer programmed characters literally teleport! I'd jump off the slide and be about half the slide away from them and just like that they'd appear right beside me. When I would jump, the game would suddenly become very laggy. Please fix this.",
      "This is the worst games I have ever played! The graphics are worser then my 4 year old sisters drawing! And it seems like the game is just about ads! It's glitchy and the first thing I got it it took a hour for it to open do not recomend itüò°"

      "Why does your user name and other information like your score take up half the screen? I can't see other players as the huge font blocks view. Have a setting to disable this. Good game but lost a few times because of this",
      "This is just a rip off off slither.io. it has codes,the dots when you die.they stole the picture with the snake from slither.io, this snake is really just really skinny.multiplayer, online however you call it its all a simple lie. Its all bots! There is just one thing thing that caught me. UPGRADES.NO, NOT WITH COINS, WITH ADS!!!! That is stupid! Why would you need upgrades! This game needs a 2 star, but did we forget something? OH YEAH! THAT ITS A RIP OFF! SO it deserves a 1 star.Terrible Game!",
      "very good game over all, loads wells. Can switch the settings which is nice. fun customizable skins. ONLY CONCERN: I was under the assumption that it was round by round or timed matches.. I just had 20k points and who ever loaded into game Cant play. If I consume the 80% of the map, it becomes not fair to new players. Please switch or make a second match with 5 minute matches OR most points win. or I'll never loose. I just make a giant circle and have everyone dead. that's not fair.",
      "the ads are fine but I rate it 4 stars because I want some updates the even are sock but what about more modes like a team mode or a elimination and add some more stuff to the game and I have a Question are the other players bots or real people I will appreciate if you that stuff ü§ó",
      "Snake I.o is fantastic it never really has too many ads and just the way it is set up is just brilliantly simple to play and it is the best thing I have ever downloaded I really recommend downloading it I hope this information is helpful"

      "It is a fun game and all, but could use some fixing, 1. WAY to many ads on top of that unskipable. 2. The lag, the lag spikes make it hard to actually play the game. 3. When say I would not like to watch a 20-30 second unskipable ad for a bonus I mean I don't want to watch one. When I click skip I still get an ad, and that completely beats the purpose of \"skip.\" I would love to rate higher but these things ruin the fun of the game.",

      "I dont like number 2 very much. I like the original better because you can change the gender and you can race against other characters",

      "The cards are too small for me to see. Theres an add in there that makes you THINK you have to update this app...but its not..its a download of another game like it. And I have to watch 3 to 4 adds before playing this game. I understand adds and why they are there....but this is Rediculous. I even have patience with adds but I watch more adds than play the game NOPE..NOT FOR ME.",
      "Fun game, beautiful backgrounds, ad for I Am Legend inappropriate. I tried to take a screen shot, but the ad wouldn't let me. Possibly because it is for ages 18 and over, which is stated on the ad. A girl strips down to her underwear. As she strips down completely, it blurs. Then it says I am Legend.",
      "Finally a card game I actually like , the best card games for me in 1 place, the adverts were really annoying but for ¬£1.79 you can stop them well worth the money to play if you like these card games , daily challenges, awesome, would recommend to anyone that likes cards. Would be awesome if you added more games like scorpion and addiction",
      "Way too many ads which make playing unenjoyable and annoying. I don't mind a few ads but this is ridiculous."

      "The idea is good and it is an enjoyable game. Until you progress quite a way and the number of words that are apparently not real words (like 'read' and 'meat') increases and made up words like 'bro' and 'sis' become more prevalent. It makes for a very frustrating game. I also find words accepted on one level but not the next, adding to the frustration. If these were sorted out, it would be a good game.",
      "From a stroked person's viewpoint: Word beach is quite perfect to play with. It's cool, clear and big enough for my defective eyesight. For almost 9 months of looking word puzzle game to play with, word beach is a game i love to play with to the finish. I will make additional observation/comment as the game continue. . .",
      "Awesome word puzzle game! It stands out from others like it because of the graphics! They are excellent! Really beautiful backgrounds too. One thing that I don't like is that there are FAR TOO MANY ads! Thus, the 4 stars. Overall, a very well done word game! üòä",
      "Enjoying game overall. Finding the pop up marvellous, well done etc captions extremely annoying. I get it is to boost confidence, hence making you feel good about yourself. Unnecessary to me. As per usual ads are prolific. Designed to encourage players to purchase full game experience. To install game developer gets data which converts to money. Ads make extra revenue supposedly to keep game free. What a crock",
      "Really enjoy the game. Wish I didn't have to pay(real cash)every time my piggy bank is full. Why can't we use the coins we've already earned ?"

The developer clearly doesnt understand the concept of leveling up. Even my 3 years old got bored of this in one day. I wish i could rate it in negatives.",

Crossed more than 120 levels and closed the game and when i came back for continuing the game it was started from level 1. Disgusting",

      "Want to know why your app is rated so low and doesn't have more downloads? It's not the quality of the app but the RIDICULOUS subscription price. You really believe your customers think $19.99 a MONTH or $99.99 a YEAR is reasonable for a coloring app?? Do you not realize that if the price was substantially lower the number of \"VIP\" users would be so many that it would take care of the difference in price? What a shame. I would have loved to be a VIP but not at that price. WOW...",
      "Love the wide variety of pictures. Plus the option to sign in through facebook and download really great pics ti have even more of a option selection",
      "This app has a lot of issues. Sometimes it just closes, sometimes you have to keep tapping for something to happen. This is what happened to me when it \"stuck\" and I kept tapping. Before I knew it, I had bought a \"subscription\" of some sort. I have tried to contact the developer twice without any success to get a refund. It cost me $105.00! I'm on disability and my husband had back surgery. That $105.00 was for bills. I have no idea how to get that back. And I have no idea what I bought!!!",
      "Several pix will go to number 12 or13 then shut down and when return to site all colors are gone NOT HAPPYalso I had 9 hints built up and they all disappeared now having problem with all again NOT HAPPY",
      "I re-downloaded it but it still is horrible! No Disney coloring pages as shown in the ads and you only get 100 free coloring then have to watch an ad to get more steps to color. LAME!"

      "Make it rain Make it rain Make it. Sure we don't let the rain get into your. Microphone for your speaker. cuz it will not hear you properly. It's very hard for it to understand you cooperatively. even though it likes to joke around doesn't want to spend all this time just hanging around. So dumb right guys, girls do humans. So again just remember when cleaning your phone to protect microphone for the Google Assistant cannot to her job. Which all she wants to do is help you all. Loves you and I",
      "tournament mode is only accessible one time and also rob the tower does not exist, and now the legacy and shovels, the game is lame without these, if I do not see a fix in a fix bye game, could not enter tournament mode so I got ranked probably 2nd to last. I hate this game now.",
      "I appreciate all the hard work put into this game and I really love playing Make It Rain. But you guys game is having a big bug where I am not able to play the game for very long...Like other people's experiences I open it for a minute or so and think it's working but then it tells me \"Make It Rain isn't responding\" then close, report bug, etc. Please fix this bug I really love this game! You guys say the bug is fixed but it's still broken. Thank you - Emily J. Hawthorne",
      "This game is awesome - when it plays. I downloaded the game because i loved it last time I had it. Get this game, excited to play it, and it either kicks me off the app immediately when it starts loading, or lets me click in about $50 and says that the game has something wrong with it and is disabled or something. Again, great game, but please get this fixed.",
      "I wish I could give this app 0 stars! It looks good but as soon as you start playing it crashes. Nothing loads, it tells you what to do but you can't even make it through the tutorial without the app closing 100 times. Fed up with reloading and trying to get absolutely nowhere. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BY INSTALLING THIS APP!!!!"

      "This game is fun, except for the fact whoever designed the layout of the game screen didn't count for the ad space at the bottom of the screen. There are times where the ads cover the second row of letters and you can't see them. It's an additional game of trial and error to try figure out what the letters are, without triggering the ad below. If this could be fixed the score for this game would be much higher than two stars. EDIT 1/10/20: This went up to four stars.",
      "Following on from my previous review I've just realised the ad at the bottom is not there all the time, don't know why you don't just remove it altogether....",
      "This game is really fun! It's the right amount of challenging to make it fun to guess the icon.",
      "I enjoyed it up until level 6 where the game purposefully moves the letters down so you buy the ad free version.",
      "Exaxtly as desceibed. Shows you an image of a brand; for example- the McDonalds arch a d you have a selection of jumpled letters to choose from in order to input the correct name of the shown image brand's name or charcater. So far have made it to level 7 & the game has not yet to pose much of a challqnge so it is easy to loose interest in. However i am still going to give it a 5 star rating based on the fact the game play is exactly what one would be looking for in a game like guess the icon."

      "I love this game because the game is silly and the game is playing fair and also I like about this game is because there are boss battles that you can fight and when you win, you get so excited when you beated the boss and this game is sometimes hard because the minion goes fast and sometimes really really fast so I would probably focus if I were you. This is so fun and you can change your minion and some of the suits are really really cute and the best part I like is you can catch the bananas.",
      "This game is really awesome.üòäüòä....atleast it's ending ...you just have to run to complete missions in many different rooms and win different prizes...including prize pods...the special thing is that we don't have to buy costumes...we can get the cards of the costume by completing missions or from proze pods..",
      "Regarding some user's comments. It doesn't cheat you. Right after you clicked the ad for the double coins it gives you that amount, and after you watched it you get the same amount..again! So , 20 coins when clicked for double coins, and other 20 after you watched the ad. Just watch your coins before and after every race. Good game btw!",
      "Game is amazing but one time there was a bug,so I had to delete it. When I reinstalled it, it wouldn't connect to the server after literally 1 hour.",
      "I used to love this game, however recent updates have made this game uneventful and a waste of time. I do not appreciate how we are not allowed to run without completing a mission. The missions make the run very short and take the fun out of this game. Some of the missions are completely and utterly stupid. I will say that the theme and graphics of this game are amazing, but I do hope that you will remove missions in the future. Please take the time to read player reviews and revise your game."

      "Okay but they have the exact same words over and over. Ads aren't too horrible, although there are a bit of them, especially if you want to do another puzzle. Even the themed mini puzzles which you would think all the words would stick to the theme, there's only two words that are in line with the theme. Not too hard, but not great either. If you like doing the same words over and over, this app is for you.",
      "Repeats many of the same words in puzzles often..like Uma (Thurman) as well as a few others and once you finish a game you cannot exit..the exit button is not clickable..only return to game. Some of the game questions like the ones about authors or sports players I feel are not very well known people and are very difficult. I do like that it does fill in some letters once you complete a word.",
      "Awesome game that I can play for hours, BUT puzzles are limited and you need coins to play once you've gone thru all the free puzzles. If you watch an ad, you only get 5 coins, but puzzles take 10 or 20. Need better options to play free, unless the whole thing is designed to get you to spend money on coins which I'm definitely NOT keen on. I would definitely give 5 stars if that was fixed.",
      "The videos you have to watch for coins, if you dont want to pay real money (which i dont) dont always run all the way through. I think i have watched what i am allowed to watch of every one of the videos available. They play up to a point - different each time, then start over or screen goes blank, you are asked to input contact info or buy. After that inconvenience you dont always get your coins and you lose possible stars because you have wasted time trying to watch videos. 3/5/20. Ditto.",
      "It's fun and there's a good mix of easy and hard questions. However I hate the set up. They have the hint things at the very bottom right where you hold your phone so they're easy to accidentally press wasting your coins and hints when you don't need them. It's frustrating. It's also weird how the games are set up in trying to figure out which ones are currently available to play."

      "This is originally a Ninjump Dash game as a sequel to the ninjump franchise,I still remember playing this game like 5 years ago,what happened? Why change name? Why all ninjump game removed? Anyway I search for this game and turns out it changes its name tho,still a fun game,nice :).",
      "Overall the game is pretty good, it's a good time killer when I'm on my breaks at work. My only issue is that it seems like it takes way to long to find opponents, but I think it has a small player base. Looking forward to updates or a sequel",
      "Am happy to see this game back, but there is game to play online, i was looking for server from 5 minutes and still not got to play online. Advertising game may help."

Such a shame, otherwise its a cracking game.",

Fun, nice wins, good graphics. I love it. I also rarely write reviews on these games. But this one deserves a good one.",

      "Its some times hard and sometimes easy but this is way more funner than it looks like on the picture it is not a scam like others make it look like i have a reason why this should get five stars it is my most favorite game on my phone it is the to me in my opinion i dont sit around all day doing nothing you learn words and exprience new thing like me cause im spanish and this is helping me in a fun way it is super fun and i think you should down load it it is AWSOME.",
      "This game is fun if you dont expect to actually win any gift cards. I am on level 440 and there are no more graphics cartoons left. It just says, \"coming soon\". Also, twice i would have landed on an amazon card while spinning. Instead there was a noticable hiccup and the wheel jumped to the coin amount beside the amazon card. Too many ads to have a rigged wheel spinner that makes sure you win nothing. Otherwise, a good game to pass time with. Uninstalling now that theres no cartoon story.",
      "I was really loving this game I am really far until I stopped getting my daily coins. It collects the coins but don't add them to my account. It makes me not want to play anymore if I can't get my daily coins. It's not fair that they get collected but not added I don't know what the problem is maybe someone can help. When is the rest coming out I reached the end and been waiting for months now?",
      "Based on the spelling and syntax of the conversations and storyline, I'm led to believe this game was written by a 10 year old. The game runs fine, but it's not very exciting or engaging. BTW, \"clam\" is a word. You may want to add it to your dictionary. The ads also led me to believe it was going to be racier than it turned out to be. Not a bad game... But I've played better. Just poor execution.",
      "Interesting, I like & thats saying alot ... I'm not easily PLEASED !! Would like to entertain myself with games simuliar but they ALWAYS put a game like \"BEJEWEL-SIMULATIONS\" in them .. I like the \"Garden & Morta..Something Mansion \" game but if I wanted to play \"BEJEWEL\" then I would \"DOWNLOAD BEJEWEL\" just that damn simple .. Hell, try OTHER PUZZLES within ur games.. I usually scroll thru a game contents & if that mfka got ANYTHING like \"BEJEWEL\" in it..I immediately BYPASS!! THANX PASS ALONG"

      "This game is designed to separate you from your money. It's hard to earn coins without paying. Entry costs are high, rewards are low. Too few balls per game. When you earn boosters, you rarely get the promised payout. Don't trust a game maker that spells \"loading\" as \"loding.\"",
      "How boring! Run out of chips, keys and coins, plus ads after every game! Only way to get more is to spend money oh yay! Level up is so very slow! Play with 1 card cause only have 1 chip to play and half way through the numbers only have 2 numbers for bingo 15 balls left and numbers are never called wow, I've had like 10 cards like that already! BORING! What a shame I thought from ad it looked much more fun!",

      "November 8th I sent an email to support@sagafun and another on November 11th to sagafunstudios regarding a purchase I made November 7th. The purchase was taken out of my Google account however the coins and chips were not deposited into my game play. It's been over a week and still no response! I do love playing this game and will continue to play but I'm extremely disappointed with your Customer Service. I hated posting this review but I wanted to get someone's attention.",
      "It seems like it would be a fun game with all the different rooms to play and that you can play offline as well as online, but there not really being a way to get anymore chips except to purchase, and earning 1 chip at a time when each board takes at least 2 makes this game not \"Free\" but very pricey and very boring. I unfortunately am going to delete this one."

      "Used to love this game. Since I got a new Android phone it has stopped working. Half the time it crashes on the loading page. Then other times it says I don't have internet when I am connected! The worst is when it does load I see no decks at all and only the legal and credits section! Please fix. I reported this issue twice with no answer. The newest update seems to have wrecked your app all together. Used to love this game. Now I'll need to find something else to play until this gets fixed. :(",
      "The experience is extremely buggy. Loading the game takes a ridiculous amount of time, when it even loads. It registers input when playing about half of the time, often requiring you to tilt your phone multiple times before the game will move on. There is a problem on Android that doesn't allow you to access your purchased decks. I purchased decks and still do not have access to them. I was told that the developers were working on a fix, but it still doesn't work and they won't refund me.",
      "I have had this game for quite a few years now. I love to play it with my oldest daughter. Unfortunately, it has begun slower and slower over time. Their seem to be a lot of issues with the game and no resolution. I have played many different games on my phone and never had an issue. The reviews all say the app crashes, mine included. I hope the developers put some effort into it and fix the bugs, instead of just releasing new decks. Until then, it's useless.",
      "I've had this game for years and have paid for a lot of decks but when I got a new phone and tried to play it, all that comes up is a screen with no decks at all nor an option to even get any. All that comes up are the legal agreement card and credits card. It also give me the option to Archive decks, however there are no decks at all on the screen. I'm very confused.",
      "I loved this game when it first came out years ago, but I tried playing it a few weeks ago (first time on this new phone, and first time in over a year) and it kept freezing on me. üòë It was impossible to play a round, because it wouldn't respond when I would flip the phone. Someone seriously needs to get the bugs out of this game!"

      "Used to be a fun relaxing chill game. Then the rules changed...now you have to start the level ALL OVER IF YOU LOSE. Used to be your \"best\" line was where you started from. Now it only serves to taunt you as you have trouble getting back to it. Also, the controls leave MUCH to be desired once you reach higher levels. EXTREMELY tight fits are unwelcome in a chill game such as this. I will never understand what goes through some people's minds. \"Look our game is doing well. Let's make it worse.\"",
      "I am not much for mobile games, but I love this game! I am on level 506 by now and have had it downloaded longer than any other mobile game I can remember. I enjoy the updates that has added more colors and sounds and the bonus coin stages are brilliant. It is simple and challenging the further I get along. Can't wait to see what comes next. Keep up the great work! Update: Now on level 1007 and still my go to time killer",
      "It looked really really fun on a YouTube ad but I played it and it's EXTREMELY laggy and has an ad after every fail wich makes it worse. I know you have to make your money but the lagging is to much. Someone else mentioned it and I wanted to at least give it a try. Next time,hopefully, I download it it'll have it fixed cause I really want to play it.",
      "Update: I don't like the new updates to the game. You have to restart at the beginning everytime you die and the controls are touchy. I can be nowhere near a object if another color and I die. They removed what made me like the game. I'll keep checking back but as of now, I'm disappointed. I'm really liking the new update so far! I like this game. I like the game play and for the lack of a better word, physics of it. Pay the money to kill the ads, it's worth it.",
      "Fun game, I'd give it a 5/5, minus the fact that I've been stuck on a level so long it's just annoying. No option to continue at current marker in level has ever popped up. Only option is to start over.......and over and over and over. Also, what's with the gold coins......you can't use them for anything except the floor pattern. It'd be nice if you could use them to continue on in the level."

      "I used to play this game when I was 9 years old. I loved how it was before, it was like a drawing media, it was amazing, but when my mon bought me a new phone, I tried to download the game again but it became very different, It's not that fun as it used to before. Please bring back the old \"Draw somrthing 2\" I don't know why you changed it, but that was better than what it is now",
      "I used to love this app! Especially when they had Draw Something 2. This one lacks the drawing tools, so you just have one type of thing to draw with. I hate that they added ads! They never had this before, and you can't exit out fast. Like I get when you want extra bombs or coins to watch an ad, but for everyone else, just let us skip it! Kind of disappointed with how it is now. I wish they could bring back draw something 2.",
      "The game itself is fun. Too bad the company is worried more about the ads that are clicked on than the enjoyment of the customer base because it randomly brings up ads in the middle of you drawing without you actually clicking on the ad at the bottom. All of my friends have noticed the same thing and agree it's annoying and the reason they stopped playing.",
      "I used to love this game but it completely sucks now. I had to log back in after getting a new phone and it deleted all my games and the colors I bought. I haven't logged out recently but all my stuff is gone again. It keeps crashing now and splitting my drawing in half. It's also VERY slow and glitchy. I completely gave up. Worst app.",
      "Finally found out how to turn off the random games. That option alone makes this game 100% better. Still, I am disappointed with the insane words chosen for the heroines and the girl power specials. How am I supposed draw words like care and bravery?!? Really? Out of all the awesome things that women do we have to go with such words?"

Which is what makes most what if or would you rather games boring, you dont have a reason to be there. But you, three kind app developers, deserve 5 stars.‚ù§",

When will we stop getting billed for this simple app that is well worth $2.00 but not worth $2.00 every week!! I want my money back! And how do I get the charges to stop?!",
      "So I purchased the app. It's an OK app. But I wish it were more interactive. Meaning, when my nephew sees 4x4, and he says the correct answer out loud, the app recognizes it. And also, it would be awesome if you had the option of portrait mode instead of just landscape all the time. It's less awkward to hold your phone in portrait vs. landscape. Last, makes zero sense to me that addition/subtraction and multiplication/division are on separate apps. Feels like a cheap money grab. Note 10+",

      "This game is horrible for android devices!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have any kind of android device, DONT DOWNLOAD THE GAME!!!!! it doesn't finish loading. It gets to the agreement part, then loads the game, then just goes back to the home screen. Reading the reviews, i thought it would be a cute and fun game to play!! But NO I didn't even get the chance to play it and see what it was about, see if it was fun, or see if I would like the game, CAUSE I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO PLAY!!!!",
      "I love the game it's just that I can't change the name of my boo. I tried to click the pencil on the right of the BOO ID CARD but when I start typing and erasing the existing BOO name, it doesn't work. For the next update, can you fix this problem. Thank you.",
      "I love this app. This app has some flaws though. I can't change my boos name and there are just a bit to many adds. I use to have this app on IOS.I also had boo town to go with it so when I found out Android doesn't have it I was disappointed. You don't need to purchase anything with real money to get coins you just need to play. If the app makers see this please add boo town to Android I would love that it would me so much to me.But this is an over all good app.Hope this review helped you out.",
      "Awesome!!! I love the mini-games, the Boos are adorable, and then you tap them play jump all around screen I love my boo she is adorable all the Boos are adorable and I love when you go outside. This game is amazing!!! It's the best game ever 5 stars for this game",
      "I love this game so much it is super addicting and i love the little character. It is super easy to level up but there are a lot of levels in think there are 60 I seriously recommend this game!!!"

      "After reading other people's reviews, I guess when I first downloaded the game, I got logged in to someone else's account which wasn't played very far off so I didn't think much and played. I advanced quite far and even spent money on it. But all of a sudden I got logged out and now the account I'm playing has to be played from the start. So I lost my game and my money.

      "It is such a fun game! I am happy that you can change controls in settings because the one you get are soo hard. And there is sooo much character's! And plus there is like nooooo ads. And it is totally not glitchy. The only thing... when are you guys going to make a update? The last update was in 2018. And right now it is 2020. But I still like this game!! This is why I picked this game 5! Remember kids (or teenagers or ground ups) to ge TV this game! THIS GAME IS LIKE A TROPHY!",
      "Great game, but unfortunately riddled with bugs, crashes, glitches, long (and often innapropriate) unskipable ads, and other things, sometimes make it borderline unplayable. Edit: Absolutely unplayable. The amount of crashes I've had with this is insane. Literally every time. I updated my phone and all of a sudden the game literally does not work. Downgraded to 1 star. Screw this.",
      "Love > Lag This game is, without a doubt, one of my favourites; Run was great on Kongregate and fits greatly with a touch screen. While the game has a SUBSTANTIAL amount of lag (optimisation obviously wasn't in the minds of any of the developers) I still find myself wanting to play it which just speaks to the great gameplay!",
      "I love it! I like how the characters in the game move. Sometimes I switch them to finish a hard level at different times. And I love how the tunnels are made! They are very creative to me! I actually have no problems with this game. Sometimes I even play this at school! I'm glad I downloaded this game!",
      "Amazing game, wonderful graphics! So, so adicting! I gave it a five, but Lags now and then, but i really, really do recomend this game! I first played it on \"cool math\" I think this version is far more better! Lots more levels too! Charming cast of charicters, very fun way to spend time! Especally when you are in a car trip this game will KILL time! And unlike some other games, you wont get spamed with dumb ads. Its very hard for me to \"like\" a game, but i defenatly LOVE this game! Recomend it!"

Not one ad after each game but 2 or 3 in which the close √ó is invisible or only appears long after its run, auto opens to play store to download the game which you must close each time & ads started before I was out of tries.Went from a PERFECT GAME I loved to play 1 after the other trying to top my score to too much trouble to get 1 game every few min.s. SADüò£",
      "Fun game but you don't need an ad between every round.",
      "Too many Ads. One ad plays after each puzzle. That makes this game not fun! Uninstalling immediately!",
      "This is basically just an add attraction. They make it so whatever you press, you get an add. If you win, loss, go to next level, or settings, it is always an add. They also make it tough for you to solve the word. (There is also me playing this game, but I'm the one ranting here.)",
      "Played for 3 minutes, 9 adverts. 2 between games very often. What an absolute joke. Deleted obviously, don't waste your time downloading. in the time its taken you to read this review you'll have watched 4 adverts. Update: Don't tell me you need double ads to support the game. If you didn't have so many of them maybe more people would play and you'd earn more overall. You can't really be that stupid right?"

      "I used this app for a long time because I enjoyed the customization and simplicity of it. I bought pro right off the bat because I liked that I could remove ads. Well, they have apparently decided the revenue stream from ads is good enough that they would force you to have ads if you wanted the customization, even if you already bought pro. Too bad they're going to lose users because there are other apps out there that don't force that. I'm out. Enjoy the money you got from me for pro.",
      "The app stops loading and you have to refresh it from time to time. Ive used this app on 3 different phones. At first I thought it was my phone with poor connection but after having the same problem with different phones and service, it turns out it was the app. Makes it difficult to browse when you have to constantly have to refresh it.",
      "Pretty nice UI but sometimes buggy. Will lose where you are if you leave the app sometimes. I have a bug that won't let me sign in on a new account so I will no longer be able to use this app I guess.",
      "This is hands-down the best app for Reddit, I literally cannot use any other app for Reddit now. It has a lot of features and customizability that makes it Head and Shoulders above the competition, even Reddit official app could take a few cues from the developers at reddit is fun. Keep up the great work guys, love the app, never change!",
      "Overall very good. A bit clunky when trying to search for and add new subreddits. It's quick to load, has a never ending scroll and it plays nice with other apps running on my phone at the time. (Unlike the official Reddit app and Skype). It's not a resource hog (HD space, RAM) which I like, but it doesn't refresh content as often as I would like it to. I end up seeing the same posts in the evening that I did in the morning. For me, that's it's biggest flaw."

      "It's a perfect game for people who like monster truck games the graphics is good you can upgrade your truck and the best part about it is you can do races and some of the races is challenging so this should be a excellent game who like monster trucks so that's why I rated 5 stars and plus I played this game before but I deleted the game but i found it again and redowloded hope you enjoy the game check it out !!!üòé",
      "The game is fun initially. But after about four days, you come to realize all the levels are exactly the same. Not even a change of ramps or background. And the further you get in the game, the longer each upgrade takes to earn. If you want a game for just a day or two, this will work. But if you're looking for a good game that will have play value over time, this is not it.",
      "Nice game, no pay to win necessary....So come on, why when you go up a tier do you say \"congratulations, here's a ¬£24.99 offer to help you on your way\" piss taking money grabbers, the lot of you. I originally gave 5 stars because i enjoyed it, but, the money grabbing side of it has changed my mind, Deleted the game, don't recommend you let your kids download it, the adverts get rather agressive.",
      "As others have mentioned, the game becomes rigged after the first few challenges to encourage you to spend money. Very, very frustrating. The game also isnt very innovative or fun. There's nothing about the game that justifies its high rating, which makes me wonder if there's been some voting manipulation. Overall, a pretty bad game.",
      "Horrible racing. Buttons missing needed for racing. Poor game play, clearly did a perfect jump but credited for too late. Way too buggy stay away. They really paid a lot of people to give a 5 star rating. I cant immagine that many ppl being so bored to find this fun. 1 track 1 button (when it shows up) and nitro."

It's certainly not worth a minute with of ads for every minute or less of gameplay. I just played a level. It took me 15 seconds to beat. I had a 30 second ad afterwards. I'm uninstalling and never looking back.",
      "I admit that this game is an awesome, mind blowing, spectaculous and fabulous. I really got addicted and I have not played such a beautiful game so far in my life. Usually I will delete my downloaded games within 1 to 3 days because it's boring. But this game, it's not at all boring and this game is still with me since last 2 or 3 weeks! You deserve such positive comments like this for your work. Great job. I appreciate it.",
      "1 star because the WORST Playgendary when it comes to ads. This game takes every single opportunity to run 30-second ads - even if you opted NOT to accept multiplier earnings. You aren't given any option not to view ads. You can't pay for all stat upgrades and skip the free ones with ads. I am not going to pay to remove ads because the last 2 Playgendary games I did, the developers couldn't keep their promises of removing all ads that I still got to watch to proceed. In short I don't think you can get rid of ads in any of their games. I'll just leave it on for as long as my kids will play with it but must admit it is getting boring with the over supply of ads.",
      "I've given this game low scores because it tries to trick you into signing up for a ¬£6.99 per week 'Platinum' membership. The way it does this is by placing a big START button at the beginning that looks like it starts the game. If you press it, you'll be charged 7 pounds a month. Absolutely disgraceful."
