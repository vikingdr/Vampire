      "very helpful it's not like most \"mental health\" apps where they pretty much beg and pray for money it's seems like that generally care about you and your mental health as well as for others. You will get ads here and there but there not excessive ads. I really to suggest you download this app, it's the best mental health app out there and it's not a scam like the others.",
      "love it, great app and makes you feel less alone, as advertised. ads are at a minimum and theres subjects for everyone to talk about. great privacy controls! overall 5 stars deserved 👏",
      "This is one magnificent app. Truely it is! I have been using it for a while and it's a great way to blog, share your thoughts, connect with other people from different part of the world to he friends or vent out. You can filter the age with is a plus. It is very easy to use and navigating through it is quite comfortable. Overall i think it is really good 😊",
      "It is a good app, lovely community and rather helpful. But if you install it help instantly, you have to post and comment a few times to be allowed to privately talk. You can get help, give help, it is still very nice honestly. Some of the profile settings were strange. Messages you a bit too much, like if you comment on someones post, you will be notified of any other comments on that post. And other times you won't get any notifications.",
      "This is probably one of the best apps for talking and blogging so far. Being able to filter age is an AMAZING feature, so now I can talk and meet people my actual age. The only thing I dislike is the lack of profile individuality. I really dislike having to pay to be able to change my profile background at least. Also chatrooms. Idk if this is because I'm newer, but there is only like 8 and they are dead. Over all great app."

      "Hey Dev can you add a feature like a text counter where you can see how much of the 500(?) characters you have left when typing a message. Something like what Google play store have. Like how it shows me right now on the lower right on the text box that I've used 323 out of the 500 max characters to write this app review. Edit: Thanks dev! Also if you could also add a night mode feature it would be the best since people also read at night. Thank you!",

      "Version 3.2. It appears to be great but I would like to mention two points. (1). In using the power button to trigger I found the instruction to press the button 3 times quickly to be too vague. During my tests (to my own number) I found that I was usually too fast or too slow. Is it possible to extend the period for the button presses? (2). Is it possible to automatically switch on the recording when the alarm is triggered as the user may not be able to do it manually?",
      "Overall app has several interesting features and looks polished. However, when triggering the alert via pressing the lock button, there is no acknowledgment or confirmation. The sender does not know if it is working. I suggest adding a vibration notification.",

      "This game passes time well but the amount of ads between the levels are increasing and is becoming too much. Also, I just activated a new phone but this game doesn't give you an option of creating a profile so I have lost ALL my progress. I went from level 3900+ back to level 1! Gave an extra star because I like the game otherwise it only deserves 1!",
      "Another ad platform disguised as a game Slow to start (I.e. FAR too easy) but gets trickier and so should be more fun - but is just completely ruined by the incessant ads. Fair, it's a free game, but the ads are literally every 2 levels and it just spoils what could be a great puzzle game (fewer ads would have people play longer and leaving better reviews, therefore getting you more downloads and much more ad views... I don't know why this isn't obvious to developers)",
      "Nice game but i would enjoy it much more if i wasn't bombarded with advertisements every 5 - 10 seconds. I am all for playing a game with advertising but Jesus thats rediculous. Recommendation; cut down on the advertising a bit. It makes me want to uninstall it.",
      "I would have gave this game 5 stars but oh my Lord! The crazy amount of ads this game has is rediculous. You can play up to 1 or 2 times before you get an ad and some ads force you to click on it and install or you have to get out of the game and come back on. It would be soooo much better if you fixed that",
      "Yes, the game is simple and repetitive, but with the recent update they have added Rescue Cat (get it?). It is a little harder and requires precise timing on some levels. There are only 64 levels for Rescue Cat; hopefully more will be coming."

      "I have PTSD that manifests as depression, anxiety, and paranoia. Seeing all the thought that's gone into this app is sometimes enough to help, by itself. The app has more than just good intentions, though. It has strategies that help with my issues. It's amazing to be able to have a friendly digital penguin that not only tracks my mood, but provides advice that's relevant. I've shown it to other troubled people I know because of how helpful it is. A genuine, heartfelt \"thank you\" to the makers.",
      "This app is really amazing. I never get much sleep. But I downloaded this app and I used the meditation pack while I was trying to sleep. Best sleep I've ever had in a really long time. Thanks for this 😊 other meditation things I tried on YouTube never worked for me. But this is amazing and it's free unless you want premium. But it helps so much even without premium. Usually free apps have so many ads that you accidentally click one, but I haven't seen any ads at all so far. Thank you 😊",
      "It has helped me very much when I feel like I am spiraling or that I just need to vent and get everything out. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because of the option for premium. I really don't think it should be there. I know there are things on there that can help me more in an advanced way. But I cannot afford it. If it is meant to be helpful, small grounding techniques and just talking, are simply not enough in my experience. I also do not like how Wysa sometimes doesn't even answer",
      "I was hesitant that this would work at first. It felt like my problems were too different from the \"normal\" ones and I felt that an app wouldn't be able to know what I felt. The app doesn't tell you what to think, it helps you make that step yourself. It's incredibly empowering to do so, and I recommend this to anyone who feels that they need help taking control of their thoughts!",
      "I've had the Wysa app downloaded for a few weeks now & I absolutely LOVE it! I was more than skeptical. I assumed that having a conversation with AI would be extremely repetitive & impersonal. I also assumed that the exercise packs would boring. Boy was I wrong! If you're willing to really do the work this app will help guide you along. $10 for 2 sessions & the excercise packs? Hell yeah. Im excited about my mental health again! Thank you Wysa!"

      "I love the texting, worksheet sharing, and video chat features! But, I would like to have more control and options when it comes to scheduling appointments. I would like to book 1 hour sessions, not just 30 min, and I want my counselor to be able to accept or decline. I would also like to see an option to schedule multiple appointments, but that is lower priority.",
      "I looked at using this service a few years ago when it first came out but was slightly skeptical. Since starting using the app this year, I can honestly say it is worth it. It's only 80 dollars a week, which can include one or more sessions and as much one-on-one messaging as you could ever need. I highly suggest this app to people who have used in person counselling or people who have never used counselling before but struggle with the expense of in person counselling. Definitely worth the try!",
      "My first experience getting counseling, and I have no negative things to say. Gives me enough time to think things through, and then articulate them in the session emails, and my counselor is very good and patient. The security setup of the app/sessions is also quite good, and you are guaranteed anonymity while reviewing everything. For anyone who has always been shy of going for counseling, they should give it a shot.",
      "I did everything to set up an account (twice) confirmed thru my email and everything. But it only ever told me my email or password was invalid when I tried to log in. I was meticulous and careful the second time, absolutely positive there are no typos, and it still didn't work. VERY disappointing...",
      "Really effective therapy for me. I am an attorney, so my schedule is crazy. Being able to do remote appointments with my therapist is great. Additionally, being able to text my feelings as I'm having them helps me share in a more effective way. It feels like an expensive service, but I think it's really worth the price."

      "I really enjoy this app. Great little tips and tools to help interrupt negative thought. However I have the app on a google pixel and have noticed in the journal, which is my favorite part, I can't save my entries. The arrow button to continue appears at the bottom of the screen amongst the phone's navigation buttons. I haven't been able to hit the arrow, I just hit a nav button for the phone. Not sure when this happened as it used to work. Makes the app sort of useless for me now.",
      "Nice app, I like how it has the function to stop and carry out the routine when I'm feeling really bad. However I recently changed phones to a pixel, and can't journal anymore as the pixel bottom row icon block out the bottom row icons for the journalling function! Not the dev's fault, I know, but I hope it can be fixed soon.",
      "The layout is really annoying because the save and confirm entry buttons at the bottom of the screen overlap with my home and back buttons for my phone. Overall, the app has useful info.",
      "I haven't been on the app long but i really like it! I love how there are forums and you can help other people and other people can help you and its just awesome. A bit confusing but i'm pretty dumb so its probably just me.",
      "This is the best app. Its freeeeeeeeeeee and its not like \"personalized with the latest tech... Etc\" its just what you need in simplest form. This app actualy works on my stupid lg phone and its 2 mb of storage space! If you are facing depression or other mental illness, or just want help, this app is for you!"

      "The app itself is ok but an option to have a group chat would be an improvement. Also, like in real life, it takes a while to find the right therapist. Some are better than others not only at helping but also navigating the app. When a therapist is struggling with the technology it makes it hard to have a productive session",
      "I previously tried another online therapy app (talkspace) and had a terrible experience. But from the very beginning with Betterhelp/Regain it has been 100% different. Very responsive, helpful therapist on my first match and they wasted no time getting started. I am loving it and encourage anyone considering online therapy to try this service!",
      "The app has some issues, but the update was better. No complain so far, except how sometime everything stops working. Like you cannot have a call, or right now i cannot log in. It's good and good councselors and I'm so happy with that. Just the problems with the application need to be fixed.",
      "This app is a joke, and a bad one at that. Supposedly, my girlfriend, councilor and myself can all see what we write. In real-world use, I cannot see anything when I log in. The developer who wrote this app needs to be fired.",

      "Very satisfying...also very exciting... I can never wait to continue with the story...lots of mystery..and choices ... I'm rating it 4 Star because ...the waiting time is like forever ...and when I play I want to play right away ...so maybe reduce time to half... But other than that ... I love the sound affects and the imagery too thanx development for providing a good bedtime story keep the updates coming😋",
      "Fun game but not too much interaction and a lot of waiting for Annie to come back. I had to wait for Annie to come back 3 times now for a whopping 1 hour and 37 minutes total. Which if I wanted to skip it, I have to pay to skip. The waiting needs to be minimized to keep the pace going, otherwise it gets kind of boring. Also need to add more interactions such as videos or searching for clues. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to continuing my adventure with Annie.",
      "This is a great game so far! Spooky and very interesting and unique too. I really like it. I'm still early in the game so I'm not sure if it gets better down the road or not but, I would give 5 stars if I didnt have to wait so much. Annie is \"busy\" alot of the time which makes you have to pause your game. And the ads COMPLETELY ruin the experience, they just come up randomly and kill the entire creepy mood that the game worked so hard to create. Other than that, it's a pretty good game.",
      "Seems like an immersive storyline so far. Works well as a thriller and you do care for the main character like you would a friend. If you like helping people in trouble and you're the Samaritan type you'll like this. Ads and waiting times are a bit over intrusive is my only criticism but you can easily put down and pick up again rather than actually wait",
      "I'm only rating three stars for now because I'm not far in yet and so it could easily end up four or more stars. Story has a good mysterious start and I think having sound enhances the experience. It's fun so far and I like it. Only negative right now is the ads do seem to pop up unexpectedly/randomly and so can hurt the suspense. Overall I'm enjoying it."

The daily messages and ability to create messages are great i kime the fact that you can join meetings and such also the options it provides are a great part of recovery and help get me going in the morning also.

      "Personally, I prefer the Helo app for speed, data consumption and ease of use but there are a few features that are offered on this app that make it a \"must-have\". Only complaints are: 1) News Feed shows the same posts over and over again, no matter what settings I tweak. Also tends to repeat the same posts I've already seen. 2) The \"Memories\" feature had been updating every night after midnight but now I've noticed it can be well into the afternoon before my Memories update...",
      "Super, exellent, brilliant and mind blowing app, Absolutely love this app!!! This is amazing app ever. This app has a camera with really cool filters, you can chat really easy, it's just like texting. You also have super quick access to multiple accounts which is super helpful. It's pretty stable too, it very rarely crashes and when it does it's not bad and super easy to fix. I would definitely recommend this to teens and adults who like to chat and stay connected:)",
      "I can personal say I've never had an issue with Instagram. This app has a camera with really cool filters, you can chat really easy, You also have super quick access to multiple accounts which is super helpful. I'm just now starting to use more of its features, so only time will tell how well this app performs. Either way, Instagram has no problem with keeping the stuff I don't want to see, away. Their personalized feed system helps users find and follow the content they love.",
      "The most best game I have ever played on mobile. It has perfect graphics. It is a very addictive game . It has intense battle with your squads and it is a very social game which you can make new friends. It has a very big map. Not one but 4 different modes with four maps in each one of it. This game is more interesting because we have to maintain a particular position or rank to stay on the top. It has also things where we can swim, ride a bike, drive car,ride boat , helicopter, run and combat.",
      "Really,It's brilliant and mind blowing game. 👉( G H P L W K )👈 I am so happy that such a nice game they invented, it is awesome, Very relaxing and fun filled game. There are many games in it, it's games are realistic and enjoy full.And there are rewards as well. It is fun, each level has it unique features plus you have money when you complete a level.,I love it! great game, it is very easy to pick up. It has different levels, but very hard to master. Its really super, excellent, brilliant and mind blowing app, I love this game."

It may not be applicable to other forms of anxiety. It focuses on the fear of having a panic attack and the fear of the sensations when having a panic.\r\n\r\nCONTAINS\r\n***Articles about panic/anxiety and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\r\n***Anxiety Cognitive Diary to learn to challenge fearful thinking\r\n***Emotion Training Audio to learn to access calming states\r\n***Relaxation Audios to learn deep relaxation\r\n***Panic Assistance Audio to coach through panic attacks\r\n***Password protection available\r\n\r\nNOTE: All audios can be downloaded from ExcelAtLife.com\r\n\r\nUse Panic Assistance audio to coach you when you experience a panic attack and to help you learn to tolerate and control the anxiety symptoms. Also, can be used to assist with exposure therapy for Agoraphobia.\r\n\r\nThe Panic Assistance audio is not a relaxation or hypnosis audio.

      "This app has helped me so much through my panic attacks and not only does it do that it's also helped me to understand them a little better the audios are so relaxing and peaceful would recommend to anyone with anxiety, panic disorder etc to download this app 100%",
      "Amazing app. Totally worth it. Only one suggestion - audio should be downloadable to be used offline. As many times notifications calls get in way.",
      "Life Saver. This app is amazing!! Finally, I understand that it's alright to have anxiety. We just have to learn how to manage and tolerate it. Everyone has anxiety it's the body's natural way to warn us. If you suffer from anxiety and panic please listen to this, you will not be disappointed!! Thank you so much for this lady she is truly an angel a God sent for creating this.",

      "The app is great. I have the premium version of this app, which I would suggest. The mood tracking is amazing, but if that is the sole purpose for using this app you can get other freemium apps to do the same thing. Where Youper is unique is the way it allows you to process what you are going through. The questions it asks and the way it asks them are enough to get you by when you can't get to the person you regularly share with.",
      "This app is so amazing! My sister recommended this app to me. I used to use youper in her phone before and it was so great and so understanding and they always know the right thing to do. It's not only just meditations it has so much more. I used to use the old version on my sisters years ago but I can see a lot of awesome changes right now! In love with the new layout. Well here is a good app for mental and emotional help!! Definitely download this one :)",
      "I absolutely love this app. It's helped me through my depression, along with my anxiety and has assisted in making me fall asleep. I recommend it to every one, and I think I got my step - by - step counselors to start promoting it. Thank you for creating this app, it's been a great experience & a tonne of help.",
      "It was really great the first day, it was amazing actually. Then everything gets paywalled and it becomes essentially useless. I would normally be okay with it but they only offee a pricey annual subscription. If we had more pay options it would be a little more understandable.",
      "My partner recommended I use this app for my mental health (I struggle with Depression and Anxiety). However, if you do not purchase the premium version of this app, it is basically useless. Do not install this app if you are looking for a free way to track your emotions/moods."

      "Has support for 25 languages!  And the animation should work even for someone that doesn't know any of those many languages.  Though the method is simple it can have a deep effect even for serious negative feelings. Give it a try! Tell people that are having trouble finding hope!",
      "I love that it has simple animations of the character tapping. When I'm upset I can't focus to read instructions. With this app I can just look at what the cartoon is doing. Make tapping easy",
      "Smple, effective app. Useful for care providers to educate & people who experienced trauma. Recovery skill is based on current, peer reviewed research. Design choice is the non-verbal walkthrough of a calming technique. Bypasses language barriers. Good for most ages & intellectual abilities. Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Access. Accessible for hearing impaired, Autism Spectrum, Post Traumatic Stress Injury. I think the developers will be responsive to additional accommodation requests.",
      "Is not simple enough for when you have an episode. It contains alot of good information, but its not using all the potential of an app.",
      "Simple, cute graphics and very easy to use. I wish there was a reminder setting though."

      "This app has been so very helpful. It doesn't replace going to your therapist but its an awesome tool to add to your mental health toolbox. The themes are peacful & meditation voices soothing. It helps me keep track of my progress, reminds me that not all days are bad. Things get better. You're able to journal your thoughts. It gives me hope and coping tools in truly awful panic circumstances. The best part is it's always available right there in my phone near me somewhere. Invaluable! Love this",
      "I have made more progress on my journey because of the tools, lessons and support found in this app. The downside is the cost which may be a deterrent to some as not all features are unlocked without joining. For me, the cost was worth it as I've found it to be invaluable. Being able to see my progress over the last number of weeks from bad days to more and more good days is so helpful and encouraging.",
      "This app is amazing. It leads you step by step how to get better it has daily check up so you can see your prigress and different activities like thought boards and goal sets. Its been helpful so far. I really like the group chats it has for everything. You are perfectly safe on this app. In the chats no one cam veiw your imformation or anything. This app is amazing. I suggest it to everyone who needs help coping with . . . life😊",
      "Used the app for about 30 minutes total and so far I have had to force close the app 3 times and the videos load in 10 seconds at a time, then you wait for it to load, see another 10 seconds then wait again. A 2 minute 30 second video took close to 7 minutes to watch which is extremely frustrating and is counterintuitive to the entire point of the app.",
      "I am really enjoying this app. I love the daily check-in feature. The best part about it for me is that you can select emotions from a list of options or search for ones you are looking for. The weekly graph that it generates has also been a wonderful tool and I appreciate having it. This feature helps me to pause and see how I am doing more often. It has also improved my awareness of my current feelings and how they relate to each other over time. Great feature."

      "Great but short, to the point articles. Definitely seems to have many topics that are always on point with my current point of interest. Positive, organized and actually helpful!! Please continue to help those of us looking for self improvement through insight, encouragement and logic on not just one focal point but on many different topics and perceptions. I enjoy the simplicity of the solutuins, suggestions as well as explanations. Finally sincere, positive feedback with true value!! Thnx.",
      "I was disappointed by the content if this app. After scanning many articles, it became clear that they all had similar deficiencies in subject matter and writing style. The columns provide relatively shallow, common sense advice and ideas, which I did not find novel or inspiring at all. The writing needs a lot of work, particularly in grammatical structure, style, and variation. This app has potential, but the content and writing need a lot of attention.",
      "I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP, but the only thing I wish is--being a writer, I hate to see great material &concepts that are helping people (who'd never sit & read self help books but will probably do a few minutes of this a day) is that there are so many errors in grammar & sentence flow, lending me to believe the author's english is a 2nd language. Even so it's a uniquely refreshing perspective for all--even more so great is it's highly exceptional for enticing cluster B persons to grow-Hooray!"

By writing three good things each day the aim is to reduce worry, improve self-esteem, help cope with stress, and more.\r\n\r\nThought Diary \r\nLook at stressful situations in a healthy, balanced way. Prevent rumination by using the thought record to challenge automatic thinking and gain a new understanding of stressful situations.\r\n\r\nThe thought dairy (or thought record) is a tool used in CBT to reframe thinking. By analysing thinking patterns in the cbt thought record it helps you to recognise and balance unhelpful thought patterns.\r\n\r\nGuided Meditation\r\nFocus on your breath, re-focus, and become more mindful by learning to meditate. Take your first steps into mindfulness by listening to a selection of guided meditations. Or use the custom meditation timer with a selection of calming nature sounds.

      "Absolutely amazing! I was never able to meditate before. I tried several videos but they never helped. I could never focus my mind and I never feltrelaxed because I was thinking too much. But this app helped! I did the body scan meditation and it was absolutely amazing and so calming. I almost want to start doing it every night before bed. I also love every one of the features. It is nice to have all of this in one spot. just the interface itself is relaxing and not too cluttered to look at.",
      "I've enjoyed this app very much. Maybe because all the features are free for now... The only issues I have is that I never get any notifications when I set alarms for things. Other than that, it's fun to write on positivity clouds, listen to meditation exercises, and create check lists. Highly recommend to anybody.",
      "I absolutely love this app! I would highly recommend it to anyone who is suffering from depression and/or anxiety, or who wants to improve their self reflection. I love the Three Clouds tool because it really helps you reflect on the positive moments from your day. Once I started using it daily, I noticed an improvement in my overall mood. It was difficult at first, but now I'm looking for the good throughout my day and even trying to create good moments. I do wish you could add more clouds.",
      "I love this app! It's beautiful, calming, and really helps me when my phobia affects me. I love the colors, and the rabbit is adorable. The clouds are definitely my favorite though and I think that it's worth the subscription price as well. Thank you to the developers for creating such a beautiful app.",
      "This app really helps me because I don't want to talk to other people it makes me think more anoit the positive and I love the design except for the fact I can't use other themes because you have to pay for premium to use it"

      "I see that HelpScout has responded to some previous reviews saying that the app has been fixed in version 2, but I am writing this days after their response and have been using the latest version and still constantly have the notification issue. I have just had to uninstall again because the app is useless on Android.  This is such an annoying bug -- it brings on a small wave of rage when I get an important HelpScout notice and then cannot get the app to load the conversation, then get a mailbox error, then have to jump through hoops to try and get into the mailbox.  HelpScout is so elegant about most of its features that this sticks out embarrassingly - especially for the price of entry. If this is not fixed, we will likely switch away from HelpScout when our next yearly payment comes due.  I really, sincerely hope that this is being seen as the horrible experience it is and that HS resources are being poured onto the problem. I have brought this problem to HS's attention by reaching out personally multiple times over the last few months and always get \"friendly / polite\" responses that do not register as adequate mea culpas to me. I don't think they get it.",
      "I have to log in almost every time I open the app - very annoying. I would rate higher if this was fixed. I would love if it had an easy way to manage mailboxes (saved replies, workflows, and apps connected to helpscout) but it doesn't. It is very limited.",
      "The last version is way better but there's always a room for improvements, for example, sometimes I get a notification even when I've already saw the reply or I'm in the same thread."

      "This app is awesome for anyone in recovery or trying to better themselves. I'm recommending it to all my friends in treatment. Edit: the more I use this app, the more I love it!! Thank you so much for providing something so amazing for people in recovery! And it's ad-free and free, to boot!",
      "Great app to keep you focused and on the right track with your sobriety. If you're new to this it has exceptional techniques to help you deter from wanting to relapse, great supporting features to include family and friends. Helpline to call and local groups to attend. I've only used this app for 4 days and I enjoy it tremendously. I loved the meditation and breathing exercises. I also love the reminders you can go back and reflect upon to keep you on your toes .",
      "I love the check ins 2 times a day it helps me take a minute to really think about my sobriety and where i am at. You hear the same old skills with every app but here it takes a unique look and gives you different ways to approach those skills. Im able to be open and honest here and my sponaor is able to check in and we can talk about these things",
      "Greatest app you could ever download on your phone. And Free! I like it so much that I recommended it to the treatment team at the veterans Hospital and they are going to actually put it in a list of smartphone resources they will recommend to all of the clients going through treatment! You rock!",
      "Its very insight and holds the individual accountable.. i love it and would suggest it to anyone struggling with an active addiction or my friends in recovery... i personally would like to thank the developers for making an app this great for free for those of us that make online payments 🥰😙😊"

    "title":"Don't panic - Depression and panic help",
    "description":"The app has sevenbasic modules: depression, anxiety & panic attacks, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, mood monitoring, eating disorder and professional help resources.\r\n\r\nThe module DEPRESSION contains the WHAT CAN HELP ME feature, including suggestions that could help the user feel better (e.g. exercise, meditation, listening to music, watching videos, drawing, guided relaxation). ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\r\n\r\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\r\n\r\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\r\n\r\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\r\n\r\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\r\n\r\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\r\n\r\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\r\n\r\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\r\n\r\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/ichlubna/mind",

      "The game would be great if earned credits for tasks were not taken. It will say 2, but then take 3. I also notice that some game play moves don't go through, its like the game is cheating you to make you pay for extra options. I'm very close to deleting tbis game. Also, some tasks that you have to accept are really pointless, especially after you've worked so hard to get them. I am not happy with this game.",
      "Its ok. I like how you don't have to spend money. Some of the levels are harder and it takes a little longer but you don't have to purchase anything to eventually pass it. What I don't like though is all I have seen so far is match puzzles. The ad shows you \"helping them\" out but by level 300 all I have done is match puzzles and renovations. So now I am getting bored with the app and may uninstall it.",
      "I'm gonna get the good out of the way. This is one of the better match 3 games or I wouldn't have been playing it for more than a year. It's fun, the graphics are crisp, there's almost never any lag and the team is very responsive. The bad. The advertisements are misleading and qualify as false advertising as they have nothing to do with gameplay, story line, or anything. The fact that they are still pulling this is infuriating. It is a match 3 game, not a puzzle adventure of any kind.",
      "Very difficult to play. What should be mindless fun is a battle strategy of match three. Understand that the challenge is the game but why would I want to stress myself out trying to figure out the best was to get cherries when I can get a game with mindless fun. It's clear that the developers are just trying to get my money but the truth is playing a game that forces you to have skill in chance with no reward is simply frustrating and don't get me started on the false advertising!",
      "THIS IS INSANE!!! I had always loved this game untill the things got more and more difficult. I agree the fact that the game will go harder by the increase in levels. But they should also provide good boosters and some other bonus points so that we can pass the levels. I am on level 861! Aaaand duhh, bro! I am badly stucked on it. There's no boosters left, no money nothing! Should I uninstall it? Oh ofc I should."

      "Garbage. When I connect to our server using the app, I get \"No internet connection detected.\" When I try to login to the same server using https, it pops up with a security prompt, I hit proceed, nothing happens. Older app versions work fine and no updates pushed in over six months, even for the beta. I get that it's free, but offer a paid support for businesses. We made several tickets with support, received no help. Time to move away from Spiceworks as my previous company as done as well.",
      "Ok app to use while in the field or on-call. Push notifications are hit and miss. And anytime the Certificate renews for the helpdesk server, you have to jump through hoops to accept the new cert (Cloudflare or LetsEncrypt). Apple users never have the same issue. Other than those 2 things the application is great for checking and updating tickets.",
      "Trialling the app for our on premise solution. Can seem to find how to sign out, I had to be extreme and uninstall the app and reinstall? The other challenge is on the web browser, high priority tickets are highlighted in red, but this is not carried through onto the app, is there a setting, without creating an alternative custom view?",
      "Works well except from the TOOLS section. Would love to have access to the purchase list in tickets as well as Vendors. Still, very good from what I've seen. A link to the ticket creator from the ticket itself would be efficient means of getting contact details.",
      "Spiceworks helpdesk and inventory are great in general but this app isn't very useful. Push notifications just don't work (S9+ with all the permissions and reinstalled) and I find the interface difficult and lacking. Can change creator but not CC, can't associate a related inventory item, can't close as duplicate, can't enter custom time spent (time spent is poorly implemented anyway as it doesn't report as hours in decimals so you can't add up time spent in a report). No space to list the rest"

The designer probably dosen't even know English, so trying to create an app in English is going to be difficult. It needs to be fixed. Mispelled words, incomplete sentences and Verbs are in the wrong place...",

      "Great app. So helpful during a breakup. Helping you to be a stronger you. It would have been better if it was longer than 12 days and the 24 hour wait for the next day/advice. I kept on coding to open it, so I'd go a longer time waiting. However, very useful and would highly recommend!",
      "It feels amazing to find a helper when one is in need. I am grateful to this app for helping me to go through my hardship... Which still seems partly over and partly not... The best part what I liked about it was the interactive session.",
      "I really like this app, being able to reach out to other people in the same break up journey as me... BUT then all of a sudden I can't log in... connection is fine."

      "I really like this app as it's been helping me keep myself accountable for my eating. it is rather personalisable, however I would very much like to be able to add \"emotions\" in the log meal section, and I also have to mention that my notifications have stopped working, which is honestly a shame because now I sometimes forget to use the app. except for these two points, the app is really great!",
      "I'm feeling the benefit of using this app after just one week. I am always enticed by the control of logging all of my calories in diet apps, but this just makes my disorder worse. Rise Up offers a very helpful solution where you can log your meals manually and with no expectations. I think this helps me feel accountable to myself. Just taking this small action gives me some hope for improving my situation. As well as this feature are many journalling tasks which I've found a good way to focus my mind on non ED patterns. The app does not have a polished feel yet, and the motivational pictures after I log a meal seem rather generic. These are the only slight negatives.",
      "I am not recovering from an ED but I am very much about HAES and not demonizing food, and have mental health diagnoses. Currently I'm dealing with a health condition and I want to log my food, so this is a great app that allows me to do that while also getting a positive and safe space to do so without the diet culture getting in the way. I've been able to customize it to include what symptoms I'm experiencing in the Actions area, and then also what meds I'm taking (regular and prn) to help the issue.  I love the option to export it to PDF so I can watch for patterns and take it to doctor appointments. No ads and no cost are wonderful as well, and it is very user friendly."

      "Not a good experience. Right now I can't even log into the hum account. For me this app has been useless because I wanted it to track where my car is and all it does is track where my phone is at all times. If wanting to track where my car is happens to be on an upgrade then that's a scam. Wanting to know where your car is should be available at all times, not as an \"extra.\"",
      "With the new update I can no longer track my phone/app movement. I was using it to bill my time in a company vehicle. Now I can only see the vehicles with the hum device. We've had many problems with equipment and service cant wait for the contract to expire so I can drop this worthless service.",
      "You did an update a few days ago & now I can't sign in. This app keeps getting worse and worse. My plan expires next month & i'm removing HUM from my renewal. This app is TOTALLY useless? The sign in button is now located over where your supposed to enter the password. Really not impressed with the product. It keeps triggering a low battery alert & the battery is ok. The onboard Lexus diagnostics shows no problems. As soon as contract period ends it's going!",
      "I'm a little disappointed with it because it really lags a long time from parked to driving, and just recently it said that I went somewhere where I didn't so it's a little unreliable, and if you parents are strict about making sure your safe, and a trip place shows up that you didn't drive to, your parents are going to get confused and might take away your car... I honestly am really annoyed with this hum device and app. My recommendation? Don't get it. Use life 360 instead",
      "The app is not very accurate. My car's location when parked at home is never correct and when my husband and I used the family location sharing the app showed our locations were jumping 10 to 15 miles apart witin seconds so we quit using that feature. I really hoped it would be more accurate as I wanted to add my elderly father so he wouldn't have to call me when travelling. It is pretty good at recording my safety score even though it uses my phones activity for calculations."

      "This app has really helped me through difficult and stressful moments in my life. I appreciate how organized the app is by category and your specific needs. There is so much to choose from and even try something new. I learned that you don't have to meditate perfectly because it's a practice and a journey to find out what works for yourself. I highly recommend this app! I am a Trauma Rehab RN and our Rehab Psychologists use and recommend this app!",
      "Okay so I used to love this app. Always helped me, always had just some small guided meditation and some help.. But now... It's just constantly asking for you to pay a subscription to use anything besides the basics. If this app could allow me to do a one time purchase I would, but it's all subscription based. I'm not going to pay a monthly fee to get a little bit of inspiration and then someone guiding me for a few seconds every few minutes. The basics are nice but that's all there is.",
      "I always wanted to start meditation but never knew how to do it, until I saw a YouTube ad that made me feel different about meditation than I did before. I'm only on the fifth basics course but the recordings are so relaxing and help me wind down and sleep better. After getting the app I noticed less stress and more productivity and it really made me feel better about things going on around me. 5/5 really helped me out right now.",
      "I love the app, but there is a huge issue. On the Galaxy S8 this app produced several screen burns. First time I thought it was my fault (thought I fell asleep while meditating, altough my screen turns off after 5min). I stopped using it and after a while I gave it another shot. First time using it (15min session with app closed and screen turned off) it made another burn in my screen. I now have the play button and X button permanently burned in my screen!!!",
      "Love this app! Gives you plenty of sleep stories and meditations to play with even without having to pay for Headspace Plus. I did the two week free trail and I didn't even realize that everything I use on this app is included in the free version as well... which is more than I can say for the Calm app which literally only has two sleep stories available to listen to for free. I thought about paying for calm (their sleep stories are amazing!) but now I really don't have to, thanks HS!"

Please improve it .We need connects app the best please do the needful.Thanku",

The GoL teaching app guides the new user through a series of hands-on, interactive, step-by-step instructions to develop basic tablet skills, followed by practice exercises for specific popular tablet functions. Self-learning, by proceeding at their own pace, the new users learn by doing – with instruction that lead to Internet applications – email, web searching, YouTube, as well as tablet tools such as using the camera, texting, and video calling.\r\n\r\nUser learning experiences are directly transferable to other tablet functions, apps, and the Internet at large.\r\n\r\nDesigned and tested for use with older adults – the key attributes are:\r\n\r\n-\tStep-by-step guided instructions on each screen.\r\n-\tLarge type. Plain English instruction.\r\n-\tNo Advertising.\r\n-\tFamiliar and static graphics – all designed to avoid confusion and distraction.\r\n-\tHelp pages that are one tap away.\r\n\r\nGoL differs from other means of learning the tablet in two ways:\r\n\r\n-\tThe focus is on the individual learner. The new user experiences for herself the excitement of discovery – the “aha!” moment, the “I did it all by myself” moment – that makes the learning effort worthwhile and memorable.\r\n-\tWe provide instructions on every screen so the user never has to worry about forgetting. From learning how to “tap” to learning how to download a new app, the user is guided through the process with step-by-step instructions.\r\nStudies show that when an elder who is completely unfamiliar with computer or tablet technology reads all the directions and tries to follow then on her own, with someone there to assist and encourage, she will learn the basics of using a tablet in 45 minutes! No one should be left behind, particularly the older among us, who could benefit so much from the use of email and the rishces of the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit our website www.generationsonline.org\r\n\r\nAnd for a free printable “tip sheet” that suppliments the GoL teaching software, go to www.generationsonline.org/gol4android/tipsheet.html",

It was requesting me to make another payment to view 5 documents. I regret subscribing to course hero. I will give zero star if there is an option for that. SCAMMER!",
      "Awesome study resource that i LOVE but their payment options are not student friendly at all. They want you to pay a whole year subscription all at once for $112. If not they charge $39 a month which is outrageous. I understand you habe to make money but this is a student service. Students are broke.",
      "It is amazing to see actual examples of real work to help you assess and plan to lay your information out. This does offer you the chance to cheat, however, I would recommend using the information ONLY as a compass and NOT as a way to get out of doing the work yourself"

      "UPDATE: the issue in question appears to have been resolved as of 12/13/18. My kids were THRILLED to have the \"make believe\" portion back. We use this app every day for dealing with feelings and daily routines. Highly recommend! I have loved this app and use it regularly with my 2 and 4 year olds. They love it too. Recently though the \"related videos\" portion of the app has stopped working and leads to a lot of frustration from my kiddos. I've updated, restarted, and even uninstalled and re installed the app. I emailed the developer, but did not hear back. If it gets fixed, this is a 5 star app.",
      "I downloaded this app and when I opened it and opened it every time after, it always kept saying \"Unfortunately DT Parents has stopped\" and wouldn't let me in. If you can please fix this, I will give this app 5 stars. Thank you.",
      "Used to love playing this for my son. Now most of the videos wont play and display a black screen. Only a few random ones and its difficult just trying to figure out which ones. Our favorite bedtime routine does not play anymore. I tried redownloading and that didnt fix the problem.",
      "All videos aren't working it just a black screen with pause bottom only songs are working",
      "My son loves this app. It has helped him here and at school. As well as his classmates in his Intensive Support class.  However, I cannot save to SD card. My son's phone has very limited memory. How do I go about saving this to the SD card? I cannot update the phone and he only has a handful of apps."

    "description":"Created by Dr. Guy Doron (IDC), clinical psychologist and researcher\r\nFeel like you're missing out on the perfect relationship? Finding it hard to commit? Experiencing constant doubts? Suffering from obsessive thinking? Want to expand your mind and make it more adaptive? GGRO is here to help!\r\n\r\nRELIEVING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS POSSIBLE\r\nThrow away negative thoughts. Approach positive ones. Learn to identify your inner self talk and respond quickly. Train daily and improve your wellness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE BACKED\r\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG apps.\r\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, ROCD and maladaptive thinking. \r\n\r\nHOW DO I MANAGE MY ROCD?\r\nThe foundations of a healthy mind are built upon flexible beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that “my partner has to be perfect” or “I have to be 100% certain about my partner“ - I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my ability to deal with relationships will decrease.\r\n\r\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\r\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. Once we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self talk, it can change our beliefs and help us get rid of the ones that negatively affect our well being.\r\n\r\nHOW GG APPS WORK\r\nThe application is designed to:\r\n1. Increase your awareness of negative and obsessive thoughts.\r\n2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts.\r\n3. Increase your access to neutral, adaptive and positive thoughts.\r\n4. Increase the accessibility of the above processes.\r\n5. Provide daily mood and self esteem boost.\r\n\r\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\r\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\r\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\r\n2. It helps in maintaining healthy thinking during or after therapy.\r\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and relationship OCD.\r\n\r\nTRAIN YOUR THOUGHTS\r\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\r\nThe longer we train making it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\r\n \r\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\r\nTo feel better and improve your mind’s flexibility, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\r\n\r\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\r\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts). Users are required to complete a random set of 'blocks' to complete the level.\r\n\r\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, embarrassment, uncertainty, commitment anxiety, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, distrust, fear of abandonment, and more.\r\n\r\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle of obsessive thinking.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I COMPLETED ALL THE LEVELS?\r\nThe key to using the app is learning new topics, but even more importantly - training daily. There are levels designed as \"daily training\" for you to play once you completed your base course.\r\n\r\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GG APPS\r\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\r\n\r\nOTHER APPS BY GG\r\nGG OCD Training App\r\nGG Body Image Distress & Preoccupation\r\nGG Confidence & Self esteem\r\nGood Blocks",

      "I was initially embarrassed to try this app and asked myself why anyone would admit to needing this kind of thing by giving a review. But oh my goodness!! This app is wonderful. It conditions the mind to think positively and embrace resilience and that is a beautiful thing. My husband is trying it now, too, and likes it as well. It has helped me already to have a more positive outlook and improved the way I relate to others. I wouldn't have believed it without trying it. So grateful!!",
      "I was unsure at first because some of the exercises *could* (potentially, in certain situations) make things more difficult, if the relationship is abusive, for instance. *HOWEVER*, assuming that the person using the app does not have an abusive partner and is aware of their own weaknesses, I have found this app to be helpful. It definitely helps with intrusive, obsessive thoughts that sometimes creep into my head for no reason. And it helps me keep my crazy under wraps, lol",
      "Already love this app after just one 3 level session. I can tell this is going to be just what I'm looking for. Perfectly designed for my situation. I'm going to buy the full app as soon as I can. Already know it.",
      "As someone still finding resources for OCD/ROCD, this is a very good starting place. It can help boost positive thoughts and discourage negative thoughts and remind you the things that ROCD tries to make you forget: relationships arent meant to be perfection. I hope to see more resources here or on similar apps in the future.",
      "I like this app...Its a daily reminder of all the small details in a relationship that make the BIGGEST IMPACT!!!"

What if this is a Taken movie type situation? Liam can only help me so much with his CIA particular skill set. He doesn't handle my money though ;) (sorry for the pun, but I couldn't resist) otherwise the APP is great and it helps alot. Just need to work out the bugs a bit more.",
      "Works fine, but requires the storage permission, and repeatedly shows a popup complaining about the missing permission if it's not granted. Why would a banking app need storage permissions? Denying the permission should cause the app to fail gracefully, or at least let me know why the permission is needed. This behavior would be unacceptable in another app, but since SHCU already has my financial info i guess I'll give them access to my phone. I'm not happy about it though.",

They should of got a warning, at least because there great. Literally had go through old text :(",

I spend nearly $20 a month for this!! I'm so frustrated.",

      "I paid for the app, never got access. Emailed chegg and they told ME to deal with it and figure it out, and also to give them banking information over an email which i did not want to do so I just hoped they would deal with it. Emailed them MULTIPLE times to resolve the issue, and they took regular payments anyway. I paid for 2 months of subscriptions and did not receive ANY HELP from this app, or the support staff. Shame on you, Chegg. I would give zero stars if I could."

It is efficient, timely, and the helpers are so very warm and thoughtful.” - Chaim, user from New York<br><br>&quot;I am a new iPhone user and was just able to download this app and use it for the first time. It is so comforting to know that I can have assistance when I am stuck, and to know that I am really never alone. This is fantastic!

      "I figured out that you have to align the camera with the object in question. Be my Eyes is very helpful. I recomend this app for blind users who need to know what color things are, what type of food something is, or what a sign says. Be my eyes simply uses kind volinteers to help blind users figure out what they need to know. So, I think Be my eyes is a great app.",
      "It's a good app, credit to the people who made it. Its a nice thing to help people who are blind. I would give this app 4 or even 5 stars but my only problem is that there are WAY more people who are volunteering to help rather then the amount of people blind. I have started since the 3rd of January and up till now, I haven gotten a single notification that someone needs help.",
      "My experience on this app has been humbling to say the least... I've been able to attend quite a few calls and do my bit to help the ones in need! My congratulations to the team that developed this app! Absolutely brilliant initiative!",
      "Great ad. This App had the first ad in years that i was interested in watching. Im glad, i can help someone out who needs help. Hell, maybe ill need help from this app someday. What a wonderful idea and thanks to everyone helping.",
      "Great resource. There are so many more volunteers that people who actually need help. Which is fantastic, however, the app is taking space and I've never used it in the month I've had it so I may end up deleting it if I'm not needed. Keep in mind that this just means that they are already receiving help from someone else, which is GREAT. 💕 So happy that there is a resource like this for the blind. 😊"

      "With this app (and with any counseling) you get back what you put in. But Lasting helps the input process go easier. It also requires that you actually discuss some of the questions (and your answers) to better use it. You end up talking about things that you might not have discussed nor figured out an easy way to \"bring that up\" with your partner. It's working for us, and we're not even married yet!",
      "A great way to participate when both parties can be quick to judgement and reaction. This has helped my wife and I get through conversations that would definitely have spiralled out of control face to face. It takes out the over analysis and ascription of emotion or meaning. It makes things much less ambiguous.",
      "At first I was excited, not having a vehicle for a 30mile trip to see a counselor was a big pull to this app, I almost paid for your yearly subscription until I realized it's all computer animated. At this point it's just me and the wife making stand at our imperfections. I wouldnt recommend this app for people quo seriously need help",
      "So far I'm loving this app and it's legitimately helped me have a ton of insight into myself that I was not expecting, and it's created major breakthroughs in my marriage. I am currently on the free week trial and would like to continue but the app is so expensive. I am currently trying to figure out how to pay monthly vs a lump sum, as that would be a lot easier for me. Otherwise I think I'd have to cancel, which I really don't want to do",
      "The concept is good. But the app itself has a hard time opening."

      "They definitely need a night mode, cause it's very bright otherwise. I also think they need the option to secure the app a little bit more by preventing the ability to take screenshots. Lots of other Bank and Med apps do so by using the SECURE flag in Android. Would make me feel more comfortable on the app. (And if they added a toggle option for that, that'd be even better. Allowing other users to take screenshots if they wanted to) Other than that, it's okay.",
      "Pros: the app is intuitively designed, and relatively inexpensive compared with traditional therapy. Cons: it took me the better part of the day of messaging back and forth to get through the intake questionnaire, set up a subscription plan, get matched with a therapist, and explain to her my problem. At the end of it all my therapist I had been paired with told me that she couldn't help me because I was in Canada. The whole thing took me 5 hrs since I downloaded the app, and I'm no better off.",
      "I started using this service last month. I live my therapist and feel like I'm definitely being helped. But MAN the app needs some love. The voice recorder cuts you off after 5 minutes and when you're recording something emotional, having to start and stop is very aggravating. It will also randomly stop playing a message and I have to start over and there is no option to skip forward/backward to find the spot you left off. A search option in the room would be nice too",
      "The app is ok, but when i installed it it didnt say anything about needing to pay. Its hard for teens whos mums or dads dont care about them or dont even know they are suffering. I was very dissapointed when they said i had to pay... I would like to see a differance in this. For me i just turned a teen and ive been suffering from dipression for a long time. My mum doesent even know. So for people like me, its really hard. I achually thought i was finally gonna get help, but i geuss not....",
      "Feels like a waste of time and money. I was able to switch to a different therapist and still found it non useful. The therapist responds whenever they feel like for instance it took 5 hrs to get my 1st response, then another 5 for the second."

      "I am very confused. It says that I should be able to update my habits, which I assume means it has a tracking feature to show your progress with each habit, but I can not find this or make it work. The app does not have a help section, and does not explain any more than \"tap on each goal to update it.\" Every time I tap on a goal, it just gives me an explanation of the habit, with no obvious way to \"update\" it. What am I missing? I've looked several times. I can't tell if its me or the app.",
      "I likeee too much habitcoach app is really change the mindset I only notice as a customer If u improve your UI design to user interreaction is too much better for me and all customer for e.g headway,blinklist. only u focus on user interface to read well and more lead to habitcoach team I hope u will improve it.

I am a masters level psychologist/counselor, and am familiar with the dsm V. Yes some symptoms are essential, but many are, say, 3 of the following 5 symptoms make the problem suspicious if not possible per that manual. Also, there are many types of mental health professionals, ex: psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, cbt, Gestalt, etc. My reply.",

      "I had originally posted a reprimand i redacted. I dont feel it is safe to have what can be seen as diagnostic tools, easily available for android. But these arent diagnostic tools. See, rescuers are an epidemic, and can seriously harm. But this program is more like a few replacement references. A lot of it is simply like entries youd find if googling a problem, but well organized. I guess if rescuers get hold of this..this psych doc..feels they might do a few things proper. Maybe. Slap them.",

Where is psychopathy, for example? Badly indexed and poor search functjon. Really amateurish effort, based on a bad attempt at appearance rather than usability."

      "I love the app's content, but find certain aspects of the UI to be frustrating. Definitely needs a search function and I can't understand why this hasn't already been resolved. It is hard to find the things I know I've saved and they seem to disappear completely at times. This leads me to be more anxious and frustrated as I sometimes search for ages for a specific story, meditation, or class and then ultimately give up using the app or just pick something that I can't fully delve into.",
      "This is one of the most well-done and educational apps I have come across, and I have been so helped by the guidance and the less guidance etc variety of selections they have. Do yourself a favor and get it. I want to give it a five; however, the user interface could be organized a bit better and there are sometimes (often enough to be stressful) glitches in audio cutting out. It would be great to not only have fav meditations but also be able to organize a \"my library\" of fav series w/ folders",
      "Okay so...the contents of the app are great. I've found it very useful for me in managing anxiety in these crazy Covid-19 times. But...the organization, lack of search, and ineffective favoriting method are beginning to make me look elsewhere. Around a month ago I had emailed help or support with some suggestions but they were \"taken under consideration\", which we all know what that means. Please fix this. Tamara's amazing, but not THAT amazing.",
      "Beautiful sounds and songs. However you're locked out of almost all meaningful guided meditations, or relaxing stories unless you pay a subscription. The music is beautiful and I used it frequently, I just feel there's plenty of apps I can get the same from, for free. If this offered more free options then I might change my opinion, and rating.",
      "I tried to use this along with primed mind and I was severely disappointed. The Lebron mental fitness is quite great but it's not content you can listen to over and over again as meditation. Developers, please listen to primed mind for an example of what guided meditation is. Great idea, terrible execution. Additionally, the navigation is not intuitive! Quite frankly frustrating for first time users such as myself. I was really hoping this would have some useful content that are not on primed"

      "App put MALWARE on my Galaxy S9 Right after installing several apps my phone got several notifications of explicit nature. Then my phone started dropping calls & sucking battery. I took it in to my Carrier. I was told my phone had Malware installed. How? This app put Malware on my phone. They found it, deleted it & uninstalled this app. Be careful, now I know not every app in Google play store is safe! Just look at developer's email address, says it all",
      "Really good information if you are having trouble in your relationship! I like how its broken down into simple, realistic goals or steps so it seems doable!",
      "It's very good information, I applied it to what I thought was a 17 year lost relationship and I'm happy to say things are improving very well. Thanks so much for creating such a wonderful app, if folks do the work, it will work."

It's really easy to figure out when you first start off. & if you have a question about the app, there are always kind people to answer. The community is great. It's a great way to relate to others & get support & advice. I do miss being able to use kin for the other emotions though. Sometimes I feel like some of my vents don't really fit some of the emotions."
