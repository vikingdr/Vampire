      "I have a 3rd gen Chromecast that up until the recent update worked perfectly. Now I can't cast any device at all. Google home allows me to set up the device, but then it says to me that the room is offline. When clearly it is not since google chrome is casting stock photos on my tv. Please help! I have already reached out to the google .support community pages and the advice I get is to do a factory reset. I've done that several times and still get this error. please help asap",
      "I have the Google home mini and I love it. It was really easy to set up with this app. The Google Home mini is awesome! I really appreciate that (unlike the echo dot) it never goes off on a tirade of useless information completely unprompted; and when asked anything, it always replies with the appropriate/accurate response. The apps user interface for setup is extremely easy. It pretty much does everything for you. After that though, I found navigation within the app somewhat convoluted.",
      "Great when it works frustrating when it doesn't. Creating routines and using commands is great but every now and then Google will make a tweak causing \"x\" command to stop working. For instance I used to be able to say lock front door and now it's confused not knowing which device I want to use. Previously it was asking to \"play thumbs up playlist\" on Google music and I've since had to modify it to say \"play my ...\" All these changes but no notification as to what changed",
      "This app is great to turn off lights or broadcast from any room or even from a car or train. Google devs please remember that users will access this via a Touchscreen not just voice and update the app so the rooms can be filtered from a drop down list. At the moment I have to scroll forever to get to a room at the bottom of this list. I'm not going to say 'hey google' on a train full of people. Please put a filter at the top.",
      "I'm honestly wondering what Google is doing with this app. Firstly, no other choice of video call then Duo and it's not accessible if you do not want to link a phone number. Now I am figuring out that casting Iheart Radio does not work either....it seems that this option is not available in Canada.....wow...why?"

Half of thev time no instructions. No charger with Fitbit type thing. I have spent too much in shipping fees. Watch and pay attention and fully read everything what selling.",
      "So far, so good. Seems to have interesting items. Read the comments on the item before making your purchase. Item may be not exactly what your looking for. Sizes run a bit smaller. Shipping times and/or pricing, can be a bit tense at times. Especially when you select color and/or other options at the \"Buy\" button. However, with the sales, discounts, and promos, shipping & pricing can be forgiving. It says its a WISH app. Seems a bit more interesting then WISH, maybe cause its new, (to me). 😊",
      "I really love this app but don't change anything because every developer keeps changing their app and makes it lousy that I have no choice but to find something else to replace it but can't. I can never find what I'm searching for: Samsung Galaxy Tab A 550 9.7 cases but in it gives me anything but what I'm looking for!☹️😡",
      "Totally awesome! I love it & every single item I have ordered. Usually items arrive early or by their delivery date. I have had a couple things never arrive at all. They refunded the money immediately. I be mindful, and pay attention...some things are misleading, size, quality and quality... that being said R FAMILY GIVES THIS APP 5 STARS & 10 THUMBS UP!",
      "Love the app really low prices, however, most items listed/or attempted to purchase are usually not available. I have only received 1% of the items I tried to purchase for $0.50."

      "Very fun, and somewhat addictive; however, I refuse to pay to play a game, so it hasn't been much fun after the initial provided funds ran out. You can earn a small amount of gems each day by watching videos or downloading apps. Otherwise, you can earn $ through your designs, BUT you need the funds to design, so you're stuck. They try to force you to pay to play. Nope! It would be more fun if there was a limitless option to just design anything you wanted - the dreamhouse you've always admired.",
      "As a retired interior designer, I truly enjoy the challenges. It keeps my head in the industry! I'm downgrading my previous post. The web designer has increased ways for players to spend money...pay to play. Voting is a joke. I guess it depends where you fall in rotation, but a poorly designed minimalist room might grade lower than one carefully designed. Cost to enter all of the challenges can run in excess of $100 per month. I now give it only 3 stars.",
      "GREAT GAME!!! Literally the ONLY game I play!!! The only thing is it is difficult to continually play if you don't do the Free Challenges that earn you diamonds which can be traded in for cash in the game....or unless you've just got a bunch of extra cash to spend on the game... it is surprisingly hard and a great game that is both fun and challenging. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone!!!💜💜💜",
      "Very poor tutorial. Very little wall, floor, and table art to choose from,even to buy. Very hard to find matching couches, chairs, end tables and coffee tables. Sometimes your challenges only have one or two choices of furniture. That really takes the fun out of challenges. Give us more furniture choices please. We will buy it and have fun. Please also give us matching furniture. For example a Whom home idealist couch has no chair to match. Makes it hard to decorate. I hope you understand. I do",
      "I really liked the game and played it every day. However, since I don't have money to spend on virtual fake furniture, I completed offers for free diamonds. I only received the promised rewards 75% of the time. And it seems like the days I did complete the offers I got 10 + calls from telemarketers. This game is fun but not worth the hassle. I'll find a slightly less fun, but much less frustrating game that doesn't stesl my phone number and put trackers in my tablet or phone."

      "I am not able to use my gems at all. It doesn't make any sense I play so many levels and still can't buy boosters with them. Secondly, it takes too long to decorate one room due to the expensive nature of the items required. It really is demotivating. A lovely game but it needs some upgrades.",
      "Better than Homescapes but still too many puzzles. If I want a puzzle game, I get one. It's sad that I cannot really be creative but mainly have to struggle with hard puzzle levels for a tiny bit of creative action, and then you only have five lives and no way to even earn diamonds unless you spend real money. I'll probably uninstall soon. Pity, because the design options are really sweet and fun! I just don't get to do enough of it! Less (hard) puzzles, more designing, please!",
      "I love this game, but I am starting to get really pissed off with it. Everything is so much over expensive, I have to win three or more challenges to buy just one thing? And the \"rewards\" are just as useless. Things cost 3000 or 4000 coins to buy, but when I earn a reward I get 50 or maby 100 coins? Seriously, what does that help? I am at level 1600, I don't want to uninstall this game, but if it keeps pissing me off like this, I will.",
      "Used to be one of my favorite games, but the cost for each task is getting ridiculous. I'm especially not liking \"collecting gloves\" in the item restoration feature. Basically, a glove falls into the playing field, and you have to make a match next to it to collect it. Wouldn't be that bad if they actually fell regularly. I have played several levels without a single glove appearing on the board. And then to require 6 or even 7 gloves to complete 1 little task???",
      "Excited!!! I had to download from beginning, 3 times when I got new phones and started over each time, now I've reached level 439... and going strong. Just can't get enough; although a few levels were very challenging, but hang their.. it's worth it. I just LOVE this game!!!!!! Don't stop! Still going strong at level 996"

They give you challenges yet provide ways to overcome them. The storyline is sweet end simple. Nice to follow along. Overall a great game for me.",
      "Even though it's my first time playing this app, i've already started to grow addicted to it! It's amazing!! You new guys should play it! Especialy to those who love designing homes and those who are willing to have a career as a professional designer soon. Think of this as your training game! Cuz i sure do love this game! Who ever made this, i send you my humble thank you for creating this game. I love it!! (God Bless to the one who made this)",
      "The one thing I dislike is it only freezes when I complete a room so I can't use infinite lives. Reward gone. Thanks so much. Oh and frustrating when I swap tiles, it swaps at the wrong direction. What I love is the decorations, the graphics are awesome. I just wished we could have more than three options.",
      "Firstly this game is fun to play. It's getting harder and harder. I had many coins and lots of money but i have to use them to buy boosters. Ended up, my coins are decreasing. Earning coins is difficult 3x than earlier level. I'm so disappointed. Beautiful graphics and dreaming to complete my dream house but sadly I'm deleting this game."

      "I really really love this game. I woild give it a 5, but after like almost 2 weeks of trying, I've had a lot of glitches. There was this one time that some of my cats are missing, the character also. And whenever I play offline, it only loads up to two and now it doesn't even load to one. It just stays on the \"adorable home\" screen. Now, I've uninstalled & installed it again but, it only worked for like a day, lesser even. I tried to play it again this evening, but it wasn't working anymore.",
      "The game was good at first however my experience with it lately isn't nice. This past few weeks, I'm not receiving any notifications from the game because I left/closed the app in the morning and when I opened it in the evening, the setup was as if I didn't closed the game. My cats were not done eating, my partner was still there. Hope you can fix this problem soon. Thanks!",
      "I'm enjoying this game but I suggest that in the next update you can now move the cats and the characters. Then the well, pond, aquarium, tv and the piano will have a moving effect. Aside from that, I would also like to suggest to have more preferences in furnitures and to customize their own house by changing the color of the floor and wall. It will also be great if the character can have their own family not just pets and the character will also prepare foods for their children.",
      "It's a good game tbh but you need to add more action on this game. Like cleaning the dishes or controlling the player. It's kinda boring when your character is only sitting on the couch, outside, etc. And also the couple needs more interaction. I suggest that we can play it online like you can choose your partner and you two can play. We can also have a party or what somewhere. That would be totally awesome",
      "The game is cute and the graphics are great. But could you please enhance it, like for example, we can do our make up in the dresser, take a bath in the bathroom or wear and style different clothes from the cabinet. We should move around the house on our own and decide where we would want to be. And if possible, please add other rooms, like the dining room, kitchen (where we can prepare breakfast, lunch or dinner and the bento box) or even a swimming pool, perhaps, to make it more enjoyable."

Really love the piggy bank feature because I can buy diamonds on the best deal. Now, I'm waiting for the new room. Thank you! :)",

      "It's good to play.but after a time it spoils the mood. If u play all the life then have to wait long time for extra life😏 there’s no other choice to get extra life. There should be simething to play which'll give life.otherwise Waiting spoil the mood",
      "One of my favourite games 🤩 the new daily play bonus is great! Levels still take forever to pass though, and limited-time games are far too short. Good game, I look forward to more development 🙂",
      "I like this game but it has you play these other games to get coins and it is too much time to get those coins. I will be deleting this game. Will find a different game"

Next a popup telling me that saves are disabled unless I purchase the full version and then a full screen width ad at the bottom of the screen. This is not a way to get anyone to keep using the app",
      "I would give this game zero stars of I could it's absolutely awful and it is so hard to play and move around. It says it's free but it really shouldn't because you need to buy a full version version to edit or basically do anything. Absolutely awful I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬",

However there a few flaws that really mess things up. 1. i don't have the fullversion so it dosen't save my work, I try to buy it but the loading screen goes on for days. 2. i wish that there was split levle because of my dream house.",
      "I would give 0 star if possible.. This app is totally crappy. Upgrade through In app purchase and it did not work. I ask for a refund, and the agent/owner of this app say have to go through google store. they did not even provide refund option for google to refund me. Worst.. if you uninstall the app and reinstall, your purchase is gone and have to repurchase again. Lousy app."

      "While the match-three is fun and captures the attention without frying your brain and nerves (like some other games), and the storyline is cute, I really hate how difficult it is to change the designs. It's like the parameters for each item are too wide:. I click on one item, say, the floor, and I'll hit everything but - the window, the curtains, the rug, etc. Sometimes, after many, many tries, I'll capture the item I want but most of the time, what I've picked stays as is. Very annoying!",
      "The Game is really great. Love playing, however only see one drawback.. No way to get free GEMS.. have to purchase them... One can Keep playing without them give a great chance at boosters! Want another star have a way to get gems without $. Love choosing designs might give more choices though that would be great. Keep up great work!",
      "This game used to be fun but now it's an endless round of watching mind numbing 30 second repetitive ads just to get 3 extra moves, you end up spending more time watching these ads than actually playing the game and then the levels get ridiculously hard where you have to earn more and more to decorate and have no choice but to watch the ads! So don't bother installing this game unless you want to be brain dead!!!",
      "Its a great game except for two things.. Reselecting an item that is small amongst bigger designs that have already been selected is impossible, I can't click on them to change them if I need to, everytime I try it brings up other things around it to be changed and second the more levels you go up the more coins you have to win in order to buy something and doing so you just end up watching a ton of ads to get more coins.",
      "I was enjoying the game but now events or rooms take forever to open. I kept playing. Got over 20000 still nothing was open. Went back into the game and im down to 18000 and something. Havent spent any coins. Tested it out played again got near 19000. Went off and back on low and behold back down to 18000 amd something. The game would be great without these 2 issues and ive been playing for awhile now im over 1000 levels. Please try fix this"

      "Map location is often different from the address given for the property. I often see multiple unrelated properties that have the same map location. The feature to show lot lines on the map is broken because it forces you to zoom in so far that the lot lines are outside the field of view for larger properties.",
      "Flooded with notifications. In notification settings, the only options selected are \"Saved Searches\" and \"Saved Homes\". However, it CONSTANTLY sends notifications about homes that DO NOT MATCH saved searches, making notifications useless. I'm not going to dig down into the details of hundreds of homes every day to see if they actually match.",
      "I am disappointed in the commute feature. I trusted it and now I know it is not accurate. One of our favorite houses was only 10 minutes from work based on the commute calculator on the app. But when I opened it to Google maps to check the route, google maps said it was over 30 minutes. The rest of the app is great. I love the notes/tag feature. I would like to change that the lot size be listed at the top with br and ba and square feet. But the commute calculator needs some bugs worked out!",
      "I dont know what happened but this app is not as good. Not all the houses will show up. I've got to zoom way in to get more houses to show up. And it doesn't always work that way either. I use to just have it with the whole county in the map and all the houses would pop up.",
      "Love this app. It is not perfect...it is just a tool to provide some listings. RE agents pocket some. Some towns rarely use it, but in San Diego it does ok. We live in Albuquerque and SD. Loving RE, and always looking , it is useful and fun ! Wouldn't want to be without."

      "This app is rough around the edges. Searches frequently disregard the area I want to search in favor of whatever area it's currently displaying. This constantly happens when selecting a saved search, which doesn't make any sense. On the other hand, the app contains features the site doesn't have, like drawing a search area. In short, the app is useful but frustrating and sloppy.",
      "Better user interface in IOS, especially for saved searches. The one search I have automatically sesrches in IOS versus having to manually click on it with android. Also the numbers in the calculator are cut off, cannot see the full numbers. This app is a great tool, I receive notifications as soon as a new listing appears that matches my criteria and it found my new home. I was the first to see and put an offer on it .",
      "Overall, my experience has been great! I love the app. But unfortunately, I have to take a star away, as there are still issues with the filters when looking for specific things (i.e: garage, study, HD floors, etc.), that just do not show up when looking for amenities.",
      "I have found this app works better for me than any other real estate app I have tried. I like that i can choose settings that will show me property for sale and not property for auction. I also like being able to see the estimated down payment and monthly payments."

      "So far I have to say this game is great. I am enjoying it very much. The only thing I would like is for the chat experience to be where we could chat with others however we would like as in type in our own personal chats. I do not like the fact the only way to communicate is through game picked short messages. This would be the best game in playstore if you could make it to where we could chat with others. Then it would definitly be a 5 star game. Thanks!",
      "I love this game. It keeps me busy.I would give this game a 5 star but it takes for ever to get ideams i dont like waiting 15 mins so i can do something. Yes at the beginning i was on this game like all day but now like maybe 3 hours out of the day we need to please change the length of some things like the friend ship things \"the hands\" please and thank you.",
      "I love this game in all honesty! It is very fun and the gameplay is fairly addicting. I only ask you to fix the freezing and shutting down of the game.. I want to be able to play the game and it is impossible how the game freezes in one spot A LOT..",
      "I love this game I play all the time I wish u would add a grass tile cos when I put sand in my garden I couldn't remove it . Thanks u I love this game keep adding new things and keep up with the good work",
      "It is very amazing! I love the game features and how it gives you a reminder to do stuff. Also to make some stuff you have to use some of your diamonds. But who cares?! You can use your coins to make the dream house of your own! And get a job and when you get a job after that they pay you in diamonds and stars! Well I hope you like Home Street after you hear this reveiw! Choi!"

I can do everything from my phone/app with ease.",
      "Randomly signs you out of the app, in addition to freezing, also was not capturing a photo upon entry. Xfinity came, and swapped out both the wireless router and camera. So far so good, excellent customer resolution/satisfaction!!",
      "My cameras weren't working. Techs have come and gone about 5 times. Finally, tech calls someone and got booted to the highest tier possible. Unplugged alarm system router, voila, cameras are working. They also told me if I swap for new Bluetooth cameras, it will not be displayed on touchscreen, anymore. That's a dumb idea. Who's the genius that thought of that idea? Smh! So new cameras will make touschreen useless, in a way.",

      "it's great, as an idea. the options are good, but you need to understand! it's terrible to charge $15 a year, also needing bank, which was a reasonable price to transfer your pokemon up to ultra sun/ultra moon, being $5, but you also need a subscription for the basic idea, your motto for this application, \"a place where all pokemon gather\" for $20! please, figure out that that's such a ridiculous price, and that this entire thing is just a idea to get some extra money from the veteran players.",
      "$16 a year for premium and it's just to use Pokemon Bank. I don't mind paying a subscription, but only if reasonable. I'm shelling out $60 a game, $30 for DLC, then $16 for a glorified storage/trading system that could have been built into the game like the previous gens. On top of all that, you still have to pay for Bank to use it. Wonderbox is slow, can't search by region in Pokédex, can't use judge in mobile, can't trade on Switch, 'mons not organized in mobile. Not worth $16.",
      "I would really have expected more for 16 bucks a year. The ability to reverse-search ther GTS for people who might like my Pokemon. A full-model viewer for any Pokemon you have. A better way to sort your boxes on the go. The trade room idea is fun, but when you have to wait over 2 minutes for a group to connect, then another 2 minutes for the group to choose their Pokemon, and half the time a full group doesn't even connect despite there being plenty of people playing, it's really kind of crud.",
      "Taking Pokemon post game a bit more serious this time around and this definitely helps me with breeding some high quality Pokemon. My main gripe with this app is the GTS option of being able to ask for a legendary in exchange for a litten, just for example. Wonder Box is a fun way to give away brejects to see what you can get in exchange, just like surprise trade. Overall it needs some work but it's fun to play with. Subscription price isn't too bad either.",
      "Great app, loved getting new pokemon and stuff, untill I saw that my brother has the freind feature and I didnt. I spent soooooo long trying to get to my freind feature but couldn't find it. I searched it up on youtube and it was because I didnt have the right age. THIS. IS. DUMB. Just because I'm not old enough means I cant trade with my brother?!?!? I am soooooo mad frickin mad at this. I hate this, if your 4 year old it playing call of duty, that's just poor parenting on you part. This sucks."

      "UPDATE: Big technical issues/bugs. Tred to contact development 2 times about glitches and issues abut my membership. Still haven't gotten a response. Dissapointing. I love it for the most part. The only thing is that the system used for determining the value of your pitch isn't clear and that makes it frustrating. However, I love the graphics and it helps me to zen out.",
      "Love it so far. It's so cute and really addicting to spend so much time designing. Few comments for the developer: the furniture and items in game get a little bit repetitive. Hope you could add more content regularly, not only event specific items. The pitches too are repetitive. I can still join the same pitch that I have already submitted a design before. Annnnd, lastly, please use free rotation on the items, not just 4-side rotation. Thanks!",
      "I was gonna give it 4-5 stars but you guys know what, twice, it's been twice I've submitted my pitch tasks and the status had changed from \"join\" to \"joined\" but when it came to pitch value it said I'm disconnected from the server, the fact that my Wi-Fi is working damn well, I can't believe it, I kept losing my coins more and more. Once I thought it was my net but second time made me think it is something wrong in it, I mean I deserve to get what I've set for it. You better fix it! 😠😣",
      "I just got this game and BOY IS IT ADDICTING and I dont agree with dawn b because it isnt add packed at ALL so dawn b is a liar he/she is probably just bad at the game or on a low level. Anyways, back to the game. The tutorial is quite satisfying and the little thing that calls u \"master\" is so cute! I hope the people respect this gameplay and be nice and the developers worked very hard on it.",
      "I just want to say there are a few problems in this game 😒 number one problem 😑: this game is a crasher game the sign ceps saying somethings wrong my wfi is on! It is green not red! Problem number two: the ads I ceeps coming on in like 1/2 seconds problem number three:the loading it takes a long time put your glad I'm paceint and come . I hope theses problems can be fixed out of all of that I like this game ☺️"

      "I have watched them forever on TV. I thought the game would be so great. Well was I EVER EVER so wrong. It is nothing but a money maker. There game's are so incredibly hard that I finally broke down and bought the first small pack. Of course I stopped there I was so disappointed and I couldn't believe it was them. People this has been a terrible experience. I can't even give them one star. This is the first. Terrible experience.",
      "Started out great fun even tho I HATE matching games. I stuck with it because the designing part was fun but you can't even earn enough to buy one thing anymore. You have to play several levels just to be able to buy a bloody kitchen cabinet or something and the levels are getting impossible to pass. Absolutely ridiculous. Not fun anymore. Uninstalling.",
      "Love the game. But they should switch the way you get coins. You should have the people who want to have their homes built set a certain price and get stuff that way and give more then 3 or 4 options. It sucks when you get stuck on a mini game level and it takes 3 days to pass it. It sucks. Please fix and I'll rate 5 stars",
      "I like the game itself but wish there were daily rewards for playing each day and lives regenerated quicker. A half hour to wait for a life is too long. Also, that time frame makes it very difficult to get through the challenges. As the levels increase, the difficulttems y increases ( it seems like every other level is a hard one), the cost to purchase items increases but the rewards for the levels do not so it is necessary to complete at least 3 or 4 levels to be able to purchase one item.",
      "Likeable except could be better if after an amt of levels you earn boosters. It becomes a money grab game bc you obtain lives, moves or boosters by paying. The other cons: 1)items to buy for house are over 1000 w/ most $ you earn from levels is $795 so it takes 2 game plays to furnish 1 house item. 2) get lives without pay have to wait 16 min. 3) Limited color scheme for selections mostly grey and white. 4)game levels TOO short moves 17 moves and fewer. Needs improvement."

      "This app is basically worthless unless you pay for the pro version. The pro version has some good things going on, but others incredibly frustrating. Like putting in a sloped ceiling. The element will not face the correct direction, but snaps to the middle of the room like the opposite of a vaulted ceiling. Rotating the element to get it to face the correct direction takes endless finagling, and even once it's in place correctly, will not stay put!",
      "Very well built only exception the pricing, I know they got to make money out of it but I wouldn't buy this if I was in the situation of needing it because of the price, I had a very nice experience planning out my my room for when my brother moves in I like how you can take a \"real photo\" to show your family it's a nice and original touch to the planing of your house or whatever your planing I had a nice experience and I like every bit of it keep it up",
      "I've been using this app for just about 2 days and i fall in love with it. The free furnitures are also great than the other home design apps. But the thing is there's only limited shot for every realistic photo. Hope to get limited shot soon. Thank you for making this app.",
      "This is a really good game!!! This game is a good game just some minor lags but other than that it is great! I do wish there were no pro and just let it be all free, but its ok i can live with it!",
      "Only 2 measurements available - feet or meters.. why not allow all and then allow the app to do the conversions. Such a simple mathmatical feature yet it doesn't provide it, so I won't trust the pro version will meet expectations. Seriously, it's division and multiplication.."

      "It's a decent app so far. I gotta say though the font is terrible on this app. The letters seem to be kind of bubbly and bleed into each other making it very difficult and unenjoyable to read. Whoever chose the font for this app should not be allowed to make decisions going forward...",
      "Very good app with lots of information particularly the crime map. However the database Austin has homes that are no longer available. Wish it could be updated by the Realtors more frequently or by the database to see if things are still on the market.",
      "Very easy to use the only thing I would really love if they had the option to look up places that accepts Government vouchers that would be very much helpful due to a lot of Landlord Discrimination because the state of NY passed a law that any building with 6 or more apartments have to accept Vouchers",
      "This has become my go-to for scouting out home options. The most inclusive app I've found that shows all the things I need to know, including accurate HOA fees."

      "Poor usability - it works ok if you are on WiFi, but if you are anywhere that doesn't have fast 4G coverage, it's basically unusable. Just tried using in location where a speed test showed 5 Mbit, and app was basically worthless. App is missing basic features. You should be able to position to a point in time, then play video from there. Doesn't do that. You can skip 15 (seconds?) forward or backward, but that isn't useful As for Nest's response - my cams are on a gigabit fiber connection",
      "Horrible echo when speaking to someone through the door bell app. Known android issue but as usual Google company doesn't care. No issues on IOS. Thermostat control is limited. Have to go to the device to make changes. No 'always on' option for thermostat. Farsight feature is useless. Also I've being talking with their support for over a year. They are next level useless. No replies, to voice messages, emails etc. Not sure why they asked me to contact support, they don't want to talk.",
      "So far so good. I'm giving 4 stars because I think the calendar timer should be easier to set and change. The app also froze up once and I had to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work again. It was a pain signing back in and syncing with the wall mount. It only happened once though in the year since we've had it, so I'll give it 4 stars.",
      "I hate how hard it is to set a schedule on the phone app. Why can't I make a day and copy it for other weekdays? Why is it click and drag two different axis? Why can't I just input the time or temp. numbers? It's a pain to set up but don't get me wrong I love how nice it is to change the temp. on my phone, which is why it is 4 stars to me.",
      "Generally ok. Not sure if it's the app or the back end software, but I'd really like it if insects didn't cause motion alerts. Also with my scene strongly backlit, it's often hard to recognize faces. It would be great if some shadow enhancement could be added. I like the constant recording of the Nest over the Ring, which only records when it thinks it sees something. By the time recording started on the Ring, whatever had triggered it had often moved away."

      "This game is okay, but only if you log in every day for rewards and enter rooms only a couple of times per week. Lags, mismatched furniture and very limited inventory to choose from. Biggest issue is lack of information on how to play the game. For instance, right now with the new piggy bank gems thing? How on earth do you break open the piggy bank? Does this requite spending money? Whats the point? And either way, what is the reward? Absolutely no information. Very poor customer service.",
      "This is a scam knock-off to Design Home. To play, you have to pay money at every turn. It's a scam just to get your money. Don't bother playing it unless you just want to throw your money down the drain. Even the narrative is full of typos and grammatical errors. It reaks of scam. I don't know how long it has been online, but today is the first time I've seen it. It won't be around long at the price you have to pay to play. The money grabbing is phonomical.",
      "Froze on me on the first day, the music can't be turned off and started automatically. The other app has better graphics and won't freeze, so it's uninstall and byeee to this one. Thanks for the comment, dev, this is a new phone with pleny of space for both operative and storage memory, not to mention, I keep a strict minimum of background apps running. This is on your side.",
      "Items WAY too expensive, but the main issues are, when trying to open the game, it will only allow me to click on the one labeled \"select this room to START new design\" also wondering why this energy bar doesnt regenerate, I've had to buy energy with diamonds anytime I need them, it doesn't seem to regenerate at all. I also dont get the diamonds/rewards for watching ads or getting 4.5 stars.",
      "Main issue paying to submit a design...they get you to vote....yet most the voting is on things you done voted on ....the exact same designs of the exact people over and over. It's awful. Plus it takes the voting too long to cycle through. It was like a chore to play this game. I like Design Home and Design my room better. Design home also has tapjoy to download and earn diamonds with. This game also has too many things they make you buy to meet their regulations for a room."

      "I would have given this game 5 stars but there's a serious glitch with the designing. Any time I try to change furniture it switches back to the old furniture, or works, then changes back when I get to the next piece, and I absolutely hit the green check mark. Pick your furniture wisely, it's impossible to change it, if it wasn't for that, definitely 5 stars, it's a good game",
      "This is an excellent game, the story, visual, and game play are fantastic. So the reasons for the 4 stars are: -Bugs in the middle of the level (come on I was about to win and the game freezed!!), and it stuck in the game menu scene forever. - Is there any way for us to go back to visit the rooms we have decorated?",
      "Glitchy and stole gems I paid for! 😕 I play through levels and have plenty of coins to update a feature, then I get some BS \"fatal error\" that states that I DON'T have enough coin when I have more than enough!! Then it won't let me close out the error message and I have to forcestop the app. When I open it back up, the coins I earned for passing levels are gone and it resets me back to previous levels. Please fix!",
      "Just like its Caribbean spin-off, the gameplay and graphics are top-notch. What sucks for me is the ability to change decor - the parameters for the items are too large/wide, making it extremely difficult if not impossible to grab the item you want to work with. Especially a smaller, more background object like a path, a lighting fixture, etc. So unless it's by a lucky fluke or by several minutes of trying, most of the time I'm simply stuck with whatever choices I made initially.",
      "The game is good and the storyline is interesting. But issues such in the interface and glitches happen during my gameplay. Sometimes, after finishing a level, the coins decrease instead of increasing which is totally unfair; When I go offline, sometimes the chapter I am in is not available, making it go to the first chapter. Now I need to go online to download it; Lastly there is a glitch in editing of furnitures. I enjoy the game nonetheless. Hoping for a fix in these problems."

      "The game would be great if earned credits for tasks were not taken. It will say 2, but then take 3. I also notice that some game play moves don't go through, its like the game is cheating you to make you pay for extra options. I'm very close to deleting tbis game. Also, some tasks that you have to accept are really pointless, especially after you've worked so hard to get them. I am not happy with this game.",
      "Its ok. I like how you don't have to spend money. Some of the levels are harder and it takes a little longer but you don't have to purchase anything to eventually pass it. What I don't like though is all I have seen so far is match puzzles. The ad shows you \"helping them\" out but by level 300 all I have done is match puzzles and renovations. So now I am getting bored with the app and may uninstall it.",
      "I'm gonna get the good out of the way. This is one of the better match 3 games or I wouldn't have been playing it for more than a year. It's fun, the graphics are crisp, there's almost never any lag and the team is very responsive. The bad. The advertisements are misleading and qualify as false advertising as they have nothing to do with gameplay, story line, or anything. The fact that they are still pulling this is infuriating. It is a match 3 game, not a puzzle adventure of any kind.",
      "Very difficult to play. What should be mindless fun is a battle strategy of match three. Understand that the challenge is the game but why would I want to stress myself out trying to figure out the best was to get cherries when I can get a game with mindless fun. It's clear that the developers are just trying to get my money but the truth is playing a game that forces you to have skill in chance with no reward is simply frustrating and don't get me started on the false advertising!",
      "THIS IS INSANE!!! I had always loved this game untill the things got more and more difficult. I agree the fact that the game will go harder by the increase in levels. But they should also provide good boosters and some other bonus points so that we can pass the levels. I am on level 861! Aaaand duhh, bro! I am badly stucked on it. There's no boosters left, no money nothing! Should I uninstall it? Oh ofc I should."

I I am not trying to be rude your game us awesome but we want it free can you please send someone to comment on this but you can make the game like panda babies",
      "I love the game but I wish the add on's didn't cost money because it gets kind of boring but I really like the game.I also hope they add more clothes in the closet and they allow access to the parents room with more clothes. But that is over all I think it is a 4 star.",
      "This is a good game!!! I'm not a baby,but when my sister goes to sleep I play it!! It is fun,but I reccomend a room,well liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike a bedroom so when their children go to bed they can go to bed also! I will continue to play",
      "Play it's really fun to play with but sometimes you get bored playing playing by yourself so you might make to yeah and you not pay for the rest of the game that I think it's not fair cuz YouTubers and other people like I have like that and people people have those games but like famous people have those games cuz I don't know but I would like it if they made free",

      "Great concept but too many glitches! The concept of the game is so much fun but every time an ad pops up it glitches, shuts off returns to home screen and you lose the token and any coins u just earned. Very frustrating! I get the need for ads but come on, if ur going to have ads make sure the game works properly around them. That is the only time the game glitches is when ads pop up. Otherwise this would be a fantastic game. Developers: Please fix and this game will be a 5 star game for sure!",
      "I was really enjoying this game, it was becoming my new favorite. I was OK with the ads even when the frequency of them was increasing, then they startedmaking the exit harder to find and now no exit from the ads. I just did an update and I'm giving the game another try but I will delete it if I can't exit an ad again.",
      "Updated. I finally found the use of the coins. But I daresay its a waste because we seldom use the hints. Maybe if you add purchase of tokens using the coins, it will be more interesting. It's getting boring. I'm still at the third one and it's not entertaining anymore. Please consider my suggestion. Thank you",
      "So easy to work with and so cute...as soon as your done doing the word search to get your coins it takes you straight back to the room you were building with no loading screen...its quick and fast...thank you for not having a long loading screen where it loads you back to your current play when your done doing the task for coins !!!!!!",
      "This is the best home decor/ word connect app! It not only stimulates my mind with the word connect games, it has taught me a lot about home decor. I always been a great speller and when you turn 50, it is good to brush up on words. It also helps me sleep and has improved my memory. When are new rooms coming? Please you said in Jan.2020 new rooms would come....hurry please Thanks and 4 options for the decor would be nice.. and 8 letter words!"

      "It's a good game but needs more variety when designing rooms. Literally feels like I'm designing the exact rooms over and over. Need to be able to have more workers quicker. The lack of workers especially in design makes it a very slow and monotonous game. Also noticed the voting doesn't seem legit as its the exact same circle of \"players\" every time you vote.",
      "This game is great but disappointed that we can't earn diamonds and we are expected to buy diamonds with real money. Also I had just finished the first house in the 2nd level and there's glitch, it won't let me auction of the house I have finished and every house in level 2 at up for auction even though I had done them yet, so please fix. Otherwise I like this game and would keep playing if you improved this game more so it won't be boring.",
      "Finished the 2 levels and the game just stops. No more houses to renovate. Nothing to do. Sorely disappointed, I was enjoying it despite its painful repetetiveness. EDIT: i uninstalled and reinstalled and lost all my progress, but not my money interestingly enough. So i started again, got to the same point and the same thing happened. Very disappointing.",
      "I like the concept of the game, but it is boring. I was hoping for more design options. My workers have stopped being able to work in their fields of expertise. I have let them.sit idle for 24 hours thinking maybe I had used up their energy. There is no game tips or information and I don't even know what level I am! I spent actual money hoping for the best only to be let down. 1/5 stars",
      "Great concept but needs work. No way to earn diamonds, you gotta buy em. Not much variety with decor and furnishings and you end up using the same things for a dozen houses or so. Difficult to get new workers and the houses are pretty much all the same. It's a good game but could be way better"

I hope it gets fixed soon so I can give this app 5 stars again, I've been using the launcher for many many years now.",
      "I've tried so many launchers went through play store did research for what I wanted and if I was able to take a little from all I would have what I was looking for. Then I saw this, looked a little childish but hey why not? So happy I did, it has everything including I can change everything I want, most fun is changing the icons they can be changed to any of the themes you downloaded and the best is I can use a theme from any other launcher too. Love it.",
      "I gave this 2 because although I like the app... I am having apps dissapear from my home screen and list of apps and nothing I download shows up on home screen or in the list...plz fix this or I'll be deleting",
      "I love that it's not complicated and the themes are Amazing and so many to choose from but the last few apps I've down loaded on Google play have not appeared in my all apps drawer or any were on my home page I have to go into Google store and play and wish you could do folders.in your app drawer to have organization but it's a great app tho tried others but they have to much add on stuff makes it clutter thanks keep it up little improvement"

      "Love the ability to save colors and have them readily available for future projects. But not having the ability to make your own color schemes nor explore color schemes related to selected colors is a disappointing fault... I do work at Home Depot and would love to speak with anyone who has input on developing this app.",
      "The app and my phone did not work well together to figure out colors. It couldn't figure out screen shots of images with colors either, even from within the app. It kept identifying colors that were clearly not close. Maybe a white balance option might help it. Seemed like a good idea, but didn't work well. Ended up with behr honied white, but with no help from the app.",
      "The color matching and in your space features were the only reason I downloaded this app - neither work well or to any degree of consistency. Any light gray becomes white; any light blue or purple becomes the same blue or pink. I used the matching on a very clear picture of a gray mocha color (it was a screenshot from a paint swatch, so lighting wasn't an issue) - it returned a white with yellow undertones. This app needs light years of work before it's ready for consumer use.",
      "Nice app that allows you to see thousands of colors and what they would look like in your living space! :D",
      "I really wish you could do multiple colors at a time in a room. The app they have instore let's you do multiple colors or the trim, also the color goes everywhere on this app you click the wall and it does the ceiling and floor as well. You can adjust it slightly but then it comes out spotty."

      "Love the game, except you do not know when you can support and get help from other team member. It seems to be taking a long time. No way to find out about it or maybe it does not exsist. To many ads. How do you get help? It always says anvalable. Does anyone even read these? How would I know if you did? Give me a sign please or I will have to leave the game. Thanks,",
      "Once you get to level 78 there's no going any farther!!Naturally I used up all boosters and bombs and I refused to spend money so I'm deleting and I will not be on this level for days!!!! 2/18\\2030 I tried this game again & as I've stated in other games I don't and won't buy coins I've already earned!!- deleting!!!",
      "This app is the absolute worst for having you get stars for ridiculous things. Many of the apps do some of that, but on this one I often can't even tell that anything happened other than a conversation. Also very few choices for decorating. They just add the appliance,etc., without any choice. Starts out ok but then after you get the living room done forget it. I must have done 50 levels on the cat. Even had to deworm it! I think I am going to delete and try another",
      "This game could be a great game but it's main focus is on ads. Even if you don't click on the ads they are playing and you can't get out of it (the ad) until it is finished. The levels are hard. I've tried this game for some months now and can't get behold the kitchen. That's it for me. I am deleting the game.",
      "Making me purchase things I don't want like a cat. Why can't I choose my options and design. Cluttered spaces and poor colour design options. Game continuity poor. Some levels that are in the beginning are harder than the later games on same level. Makes no sense. I hate cats so why would I want to make it biscuits.!"

Possibly all these things are possible and the interface seems like it could be good but no idea how to do anything. Using the pc browser version to design why doesn't mouse over tell you what a tool is? A real shame.",
      "I think it was cool but why need to pay that much? Im a high school student and was dreaming to be an architect so this kind of apps really got me. Sadly, i can't enjoy the app too much because i can only change the floor/walls.",
      "I have been using this app since 2013. And it's always the best app I have ever seen. It gives me feel of an engineer or and architect. I gave a plan for my home from make this. It is and it will be the best ever application",
      "What a awful an unituitive program to use. Even basic things like stairs and archways you either have to pay for or watch an ad to unlock for a limited time. Shame I haven't been able to find anything better."

      "I really like playing this game. The only reason not giving 5stars is because some of either trying to build an item or needing to get supplies to build an item is not very clear on how to do that or why some items are still locked. If there's directions somewhere I have yet to locate them. But other than that the game is very fun & addictive. I'm hopeful in time I'll figure it all out, but in the mean time I'll most definitely keep play😁👍",
      "While I loved your Home Makeover games; this 1 isjust okay. Its still fun 2 play, however; not only is it harder but its also more expensive n has way 2 many ads. Its harder 2 build stuff since the blue prints have 2b played 4 now n the materials r in boxes rather than also being played 4 in mini games. U all have done what so many others have done. U got greedy. I didnt mind paying 4 some advantages in Home Makeover, but with this u have 2 spend $ to finish things. U lost what set ur game apart",
      "I felt happy and it is good for our brain. And them I knew the strange words and I can find the lost thing faster. And I wanted to play this game because I want to try the room more beautiful and I like the games like this. In this game, all the thing are opened and it don't have any lock.So, I think you know why I like this game.",
      "A nice mix of games and a lot of decor choices once you find them in the semicircle. The only minus is that I have trouble seeing the decor pieces properly but that'my problem, not the game.",
      "This is a great game...but as usual like most game you get so far and cant go ANY FURTHER......I have bought all furniture now, Im at a point now where I have to use my WIFI and play MATCH BLUPRINTS......WHY DONT PEOPLE WHO CREATE THESE GAME MAKE IT SO YOU CAN FININSH THEM !!!!!"

      "It's a pretty good game, I'd say even better than the OG game (house flipper). But, after playing for a while, the job tasks get pretty repetitive and kinda boring. They do change it up a little, but not much at all. I wish they would add some updates for that. Along with adding more pets, items (decor etc.), and houses for purchase. It's a good game dont get me wrong, but very repetitive. Also, once you finish all your tasks you need to wait awhile. It gets WAY too dark to see anything at night",
      "It's a REALLY good game, probably the best I've ever downloaded except after a while it gets annoying having to work to get money, I just think you should get more money for the work you do, also I got a really big house and there is sooo much space but not enough furniture to fill it with, PLEASE ADD MORE THINGS TO THE SHOP, small and big, PLEAAASSSSEEEEE",
      "At one point my daughter and I were addicted to this game. However now that you have added the time change on it we never get to play it. It's always way to dark to be able to see anything, especially in the bar. The darkness needs to go. How about adding a change of seasons maybe or some more options to change the outsides of houses as well, such as the color.",
      "I love games like this however this one sucks!! There's no instruction on what needs to be done to complete the task, it randomly gets dark for seemingly no reason and you cant turn on lights. I like the idea but in reality there are parts of it that are wayyyyyyyyy too annoying to be a nice calming game to play.",
      "This game is awesome! It is so fun to design other people's homes and design my home too! This game is so addicting it's hard to stop playing! I definitely recommend this game to people who like designing homes! 😃 Suggestion For This Game: Although I LOVE this game, I would love this game EVEN more if you made an option for other players to interact and visit each others homes, that would be REALLY fun!!! I hope they add this!"

      "I've used this tool in the past and for instance where you're ready to get to work. It's great. It's a one star rating for me because as I was pricing a potential improvement, I selected the option NOT to contact vendors at this time. The app completely disregarded that as I've been contacted by multiple contractors this morning citing the app as the lead. It's been a good source of information, but I'll no longer be using this app for pricing estimates or to find contractors for jobs",
      "I could not believe how dedicated the team was to finish on time without compromising the job. I had a deck made and fencing put in. Big job but both teams did a wonderful job even in bad weather.",
      "2 means not satisfactory I think, as I don't want to criticize anyone, but because of who they may refer you to, my past experience was definitely not professional as doors were replaced and where those triggers go into, looks like just grinded out wood, and don't think it's supposed to be that way. Maybe if I used another contractor through Home Advisor, my $4500 may have been used efficiently...sorry but TRUE!",
      "Uninstalling. Lengthy Ads everywhere are ridiculous along with numerous spam emails. This service used to be a class act. No longer.",
      "WONT REQUEST QUOTES. I have projects set up and am trying to request quotes and it won't work. Tried uninstalling, reinstalling, and using my computer. Nothing functions."

      "This app is pretty good and I've used it for quite thr while. It wasn't until I found the website version of this when I realized a flaw in this app. I really think one major flaw in this program is the lack of floorplan design and how you can only use present rooms or an image. It would greatly improve the app if you made it more similar to the online version if possible.",
      "I love the app stress reliever just what I was looking for some many variety of stuff you can choose from the challenge for every project is so exciting. I just wish my project will save it self when I'm not done like if I have to pause or something when I pull out the app and go back I have to start all over again. With my project.",
      "Very nice app for planning your house rooms. I cut off one star because sometimes it shows that 'Sorry, this category is under maintenance'. I waited for 1 month and it showed the same thing. Finally I was forced to uninstall. Later on I found out from friend that bugs were fixed. So now I have Homestyler again but sometimes for minutes it shows the maintenance message yet again. But in 10-15 mins it becomes alright. Homestyler pls help in this matter! Or else it is awesome app.",
      "EDITED: I changed my initial rating because the problem I was experiencing at the time was apparently a glitch. I still have a few problems with items now and then, and there are occasional glitches still, but I definitely do love this app. (Note: I would give 5 stars if all the items worked all the time and if they were easier to search for, and if the scaling worked much better.)",
      "I use the homestyler website on my computer but recently was unable to use my computer so I thought this would be a good alternative. Nope, this doesn't fufil the purposes of the desktop version. No floorplan maker? You just get a picture of a room and slap objects and furniture, its like a manget or sticker plate for children. I personally want 100% freedom in backgrounds as well, I know they can do it, its a shame they went so cheaply here. Uninstall, sticking to desktop site version."

      "This game takes a long time to load. Its very slow. Once u pass a certain level u have a lot of ads & constant pop ups to buy. Time waster.",
      "This game is amazing we can do many decoration of the house 🏠they give three choices to choose we have to play levels to earn money they provide competition within 2-3days they give us a lot of gifts fabulous out standing 😀😃😃😃😃",
      "Simple, fun ,pretty relaxed game love the fact that you can actually, win the earn coin games. Not to hard. I dont like the fact that if u change something, you have to buy it .at full coin cost . May you could add a half price option .or have a sale .Cause even though you can win the coins you dont win alot at once. But again good game.",
      "I really like this game, but it takes so long to finish a room. The coins you earn from playing a game is not a lot, so you gotta keep playing in order to buy the items you need. Earning more coins after each level is needed or it'll be Xmas again before i get a whole house done. I've lost interest, uninstalling like right now",
      "Sooooo many ads. Ugh. Opting out is way too expensive. Worst part is when it freezes up and u have watched 3 ads for bonuses on the \"daily pick a card\" for absolutely nothing, then we have to start over again and watch 1-3more ads or lose out altogether on bonuses . Plz fix it. Idk what would make it more enjoyable. Ty for ur response tho"

      "I think it's a great game but it really needs more chairs in the kitchen because I like having more than two kids in a household. I really think you could add more ages, eg. teenagers, or a pregnant belly to just make the game a bit better than it already is. More moveable items would be nice, eg. chairs, beds etc., just so that we can change the layout of the house so that it's not always in the default setting. Please add day and night. Other than that, it's one hundred percent a great game.",
      "This is an amazing game to play! There are no in app purchases and I haven't had to watch any ads. The game is so interactive and comes with parents room, babies room, girls room, boys room, laundry room, bathroom, kitchen, lounge, living room and outside.",
      "Best game ever love it !! I've been playing this game a long long time but im sad that you took away the car and that all the places doesn't connet like they used to please can you maybe think about adding it again ?? I still love this game and also reccomend",
      "I feel like it just needs more ya know for example the chairs there's not enough for the family and I think there should be more with the dog and i feel like it would be cool if the family could have like a cat or a hamster heck maybe a goldfish!",
      "Wonderful game at all. I love this game so muuuuuch🥰🥰🤩🤩. And i'm reccommending everyone to try to play this game once.I think this is very goood for kids and adults also. No adds and no purchases 😄😃. Play this game and i am sure that you will love this👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😍😁😘"

      "I love this game. I'm happy with the choice of puzzles in order to earn currency. Decent choices in materials. Maybe look at other games for inspiration and combine the choice of puzzles with choices of materials. Otherwise, keep up the great work. It's appreciated as someone who is working on her skills as a future interior designer.",
      "Thank you for creating a match tiles game that isn't too difficult to move through the levels. Too often the game creators make the game so challenging that it takes a whole day or more to win and advance through the levels and I end up losing interest which means it will just get deleted. I am actually having fun playing this game. Thanks!",
      "It was fun for awhile and then the games got harder, you dont give enough moves for one thing, and then the blocks you click are all at the top and none show up at the bottom, no way after 25 times that I'm going to beat this, its not fun anymore, I am deleting, if you can improve it then I maybe back Deleting 2 days ...respond",
      "COMPLETE GARBAGE 😡 Not only did the game stop working by not allowing the changes I worked for in the third room (Sweet Bedroom) but when I contacted customer service they implied that I was apparently too stupid to know that I had to complete tasks to make changes to the room. Interesting that I was able to figure this out on the previous 2 levels but apparently lost my ability to figure out such an idea on the third level. This game will be deleted! Greatly disappointed!",
      "I'm on level 370, decorating the dining room. It won't let me go any further, stating(when I click on the 'book of tasks')to look for future tasks. I've updated, but that didn't work. I've come so far & really like the game, but why is it doing this & WHEN will it advance me? Sigh."

      "This app is the worst. I currently have an Android phone and the app consistently crashes! The whole point of having security cameras is to be able to be notified immediately and have the ease of checking on your home at your finger tips. This app, however, crashes when you open it, and freezes for at least 30 seconds before having to be forced stop Its very counter productive. The app is trash. The security system is self does what any other system would do.",
      "The service for the most part is good, but the app needs work.. it doesn't always refresh the status of the security system. It doesn't always send u notifications. When you get a notification, they don't always load up. Mostly only admins can get messages about people at your door. If they fix these, this app would get a higher rating.",
      "Doesn't function properly. I don't get my videos and pictures on time. There are several delays in recording. Husband walked out the front door and it didn't capture him at all. Just the sound of door opening. We are constantly resetting cameras. We are constantly having to reset our cameras. Delayed notifications. It's not notification friendly either. We have had to reboot the system several times.",
      "This app lacks a lot of features and does not notify you with nothing more than a buzz no way to set your own ringtone for an alarm alert. This is probably the one of the worst apps I've used so far when it comes to security. I won't be renewing my account with vin vent when it expires. Vivint does as little as it has two to make money and still not satisfied as its customer. The fact that I cannot be alerted to what's going on with my alarm system it's just aggravating and disruptive.",
      "Was good but it bad over time. Had this for 3 years. Doorbell camera captures random moments. Other cameras as well. I don't know how many times I've called them about this issue. It gets fixed for a couple weeks then it just goes back to what is doing. No one has time to call and hold for hours every time. I'm just tired of them and they weren't a cheap system either."

      "4 stars as is. Follow the setup directions and don't plug anything in until the app tells you to and you should have no problems. My wishlist for the app so far is: Let me save my current settings as a scene. Let me edit the scenes I already created. Get rid of the 6 scene maximum (arbitrary and ridiculous in this day and age). Also, none of my other smart home apps depend on the cloud for local device control and I don't expect to sit in the dark if my internet goes down.",
      "The app starts up then says \"your phone has lost connection with the internet. Please check your connection and retry.\" Does this with both my tablet and brand new phone. All other apps work and the internet is working fine. Can't even get on the Sengled website because server is not showing. Worked ok until now other than a couple of resets. Updated review 1/12/2020. The cloud service has been restored and has been working fine since the correction. Changing my rating to 5 stars.",
      "App has worked flawlessly since I first installed it over 6 months ago. Now after Dec 5th, 2019 update it stopped working. Now it won't login. Keeps giving \"your phone is not connected to the internet\" error. Btw phone IS connected to the internet like it always has been. Just in case it would work, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled again, still nothing. Please fix whatever it is you unfixed. 01/06/20 Update. App is working like it used to. Thanks for the fix. Back to 5 stars.",
      "Have not had any luck in setting up the home starter kit. It automatically links up with one bulb but not the other (the starter kit comes with 2 bulbs). When we try to add the other bulb under 'add devices' the bulb is not recognised. We have tried many times. This is ridiculous to set up and not fit for purpose. I'll be going back to normal bulbs until someone can come up with something that is user friendly and works.",
      "Complete waste of money.. bulbs cannot connect to my home network no matter how many attempts. The app keeps telling me I am entering the wrong password. You may save money using the bulb but the connectivity doesn't work."

      "4 stars as is. Follow the setup directions and don't plug anything in until the app tells you to and you should have no problems. My wishlist for the app so far is: Let me save my current settings as a scene. Let me edit the scenes I already created. Get rid of the 6 scene maximum (arbitrary and ridiculous in this day and age). Also, none of my other smart home apps depend on the cloud for local device control and I don't expect to sit in the dark if my internet goes down.",
      "The app starts up then says \"your phone has lost connection with the internet. Please check your connection and retry.\" Does this with both my tablet and brand new phone. All other apps work and the internet is working fine. Can't even get on the Sengled website because server is not showing. Worked ok until now other than a couple of resets. Updated review 1/12/2020. The cloud service has been restored and has been working fine since the correction. Changing my rating to 5 stars.",
      "App has worked flawlessly since I first installed it over 6 months ago. Now after Dec 5th, 2019 update it stopped working. Now it won't login. Keeps giving \"your phone is not connected to the internet\" error. Btw phone IS connected to the internet like it always has been. Just in case it would work, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled again, still nothing. Please fix whatever it is you unfixed. 01/06/20 Update. App is working like it used to. Thanks for the fix. Back to 5 stars.",
      "Have not had any luck in setting up the home starter kit. It automatically links up with one bulb but not the other (the starter kit comes with 2 bulbs). When we try to add the other bulb under 'add devices' the bulb is not recognised. We have tried many times. This is ridiculous to set up and not fit for purpose. I'll be going back to normal bulbs until someone can come up with something that is user friendly and works.",
      "Complete waste of money.. bulbs cannot connect to my home network no matter how many attempts. The app keeps telling me I am entering the wrong password. You may save money using the bulb but the connectivity doesn't work."

This issue has apparently been going on for several days; if your techs haven't been able to figure it out yet you might need new techs.",
      "So, i love that this app exists, i don't have cable so the fact that they have some things free is really nice. However, this is the 4th time that i have been in the middle of an episode of something that was free, had to close it out for an hour or so, then went back and the show or season was no longer free. There is an exhorbitant amount of commercials that have to be watched to have free stuff, to play with people this way...",
      "Uninstalled, reinstalled twice. The app opens to black screen with circle. I think it needs me to enter provider and password, etc. But there's no message, no dropdown menu, no buttons, nothing. UPDATE I contacted HGTV as requested. I've tried periodically using the app, with no success. I did get one error message, that mY have suggested the need to log on, which I did. I really miss using this app. 02/04/2020 Tried again today. Yayyyyyy! I'm in. Thanks! 😍",
      "I love the HGTV GO APP experience : to place a monitoring countdown of the commercial break's duration of the episode being sponsored knowing the approx. time; knowing how much time I have before the commercial break ends to prepare the popcorn or multi task before the episode starts, while listening to the commercials from the sponsor.",

      "This app is the worst. I currently have an Android phone and the app consistently crashes! The whole point of having security cameras is to be able to be notified immediately and have the ease of checking on your home at your finger tips. This app, however, crashes when you open it, and freezes for at least 30 seconds before having to be forced stop Its very counter productive. The app is trash. The security system is self does what any other system would do.",
      "The service for the most part is good, but the app needs work.. it doesn't always refresh the status of the security system. It doesn't always send u notifications. When you get a notification, they don't always load up. Mostly only admins can get messages about people at your door. If they fix these, this app would get a higher rating.",
      "Doesn't function properly. I don't get my videos and pictures on time. There are several delays in recording. Husband walked out the front door and it didn't capture him at all. Just the sound of door opening. We are constantly resetting cameras. We are constantly having to reset our cameras. Delayed notifications. It's not notification friendly either. We have had to reboot the system several times.",
      "This app lacks a lot of features and does not notify you with nothing more than a buzz no way to set your own ringtone for an alarm alert. This is probably the one of the worst apps I've used so far when it comes to security. I won't be renewing my account with vin vent when it expires. Vivint does as little as it has two to make money and still not satisfied as its customer. The fact that I cannot be alerted to what's going on with my alarm system it's just aggravating and disruptive.",
      "Was good but it bad over time. Had this for 3 years. Doorbell camera captures random moments. Other cameras as well. I don't know how many times I've called them about this issue. It gets fixed for a couple weeks then it just goes back to what is doing. No one has time to call and hold for hours every time. I'm just tired of them and they weren't a cheap system either."

      "I'm being generous with three stars...First, I don't enjoy feeling like a \"guest\" just because I won't sign in with Facebook. Rude...Second, I've played a lot of these match 3 games and the amount of stars you require for each task is a bit ridiculous! The only reason I was willing to give three stars is so far most levels are relatively easy to complete. Still will most likely delete this game soon because overall I am not impressed",
      "Had to write another review after coming back to the game after I uninstalled and reinstalled the game.please tell me why I could renovate the front garden as I thought it was part of the game.",
      "Did not know I had to take a screenshot every time I use the boosters. I was selecting to use booster but it didn't work but I was still charged for using it. I contacted support, they asked if I had screenshots and I told them no I didn't. Needless to say I haven't heard anything else from them nor did I recieve the boosters back. Game was fun but not anymore. Support is awful",
      "Yeah its a basic decent match 3 but my problem is that it rips off a lot from Word Villas, including the main character (which is an easier game anyway) and the ads for it show this even more since it also rips off her ex boyfriend (which is funny bc she doesn't move because of that, so misleading ads too.) Seriously, at least don't make her blonde, named rachel, an artist, and with a pet cat geez. Play Word Villas, its obvious this game is a joke.",
      "I updated the game but it didn't work. Loading times are very long and it still freezes constantly. It might be 1 sec or 30 sec but it will not stop. Sometimes it just shuts down and I have to reload. It's a shame because I really do like this game. Please try to fix it. Would not let me contact you in game."

So i i figured out, this game is not different to others, just try a little bit more if doesnt work just like other game i will delete this",

A game like this should be constantly updating. 2-3 months between updates and added content is quite slow. I like the game, I don't want to uninstall but there needs to be more being done of the devs side. UPDATED 1/30/2020 - Apparently after the Reykjavik dining room, there are no more rooms.",
      "Enjoyable game. But now it has been at least three months and they have no rooms to design. So l have got over 250 thousand points so l could probably design so many rooms now. I keep asking how long to wait and they kind of fob me off. I enjoy this concept of the game that is why l am still waiting. HURRY UP!!!!!!. Or at least say how much longer we have to wait. I originally gave it a 5 but now a 3.",
      "I installed the game because it looked fun! It really hooked me into getting it, but after the introduction i couldn't get past the part where the lady Sofia it going to show the house. It may just be a coincidence but i think not. I tried reloading the app multiple times and its just freezes on that one part. Please fix the game i think i could really enjoy it. Thank you.",
      "I am on level 20.. But am unable to proceed to another level, as no room for makeover is available..its showing ..new room for makeover coming soon..please look into this matter..because i like this game and enjoyimg it..but nothing is available for makeover..pls unlock the next level..that are coming soon..so that i can play...n move to next level..",

      "Not getting alerts from the camera. Update: Apparently you have to enable motion tracking for the alerts to work. After enabling this feature and setting the option Away everything worked as expected. The reason I'm only giving 4 stars it that sometimes the app takes a long time to switch on/off the camera, even when I'm on fast connection.",
      "Great quality! We use as a monitor in our daughter's room and it's perfect! It's portable as well - we moved it from baby room to entrance when we travel so that we check in from our phone while abroad. Can connect through phone or tablet and you can speak through it, record video and take pics. Only place it's lacking is it doesn't have a stream function.",
      "I have had this camera at least two years worked perfectly fine until the update on the 19th February. Now it has been rendered useless not fit for purpose. Please fix this update . I have had email correspondence for the last two or three weeks have done everything they say and still no sound alerts.",
      "Not very good. The camera: the camera doesn't move, you can't \"look\" left and right. The app: I can't view the history of the same day. It's either a bug or not a very well thought feature. Looking back isn't possible for some \"hours\", can't understand why. Payment: quite expensive to connect to the cloud. Overall, not very good. There are much better cameras out there, with rotating heads, much cheaper subscriptions and easier to use apps. 2 stars out of 5. Because the camera works.",
      "UPDATE: After a year using it I can only add one thing, NEVER UPDATE! Why this app needs relogin and pair again with all my devices every time I update it!? Worse app! I have to double do everything. Settings, opens but shows cam is off. Open settings second time, shows correct state. Connect to cam, first time fails, second connects. Check alerts, same issue."

      "The app in itself is your standard realtor app. Must admit, the Opendoor feature is very nice, however, not many properties in our area can take advantage of it. Also a fan of discarding properties. Finding difficulties in placing an offer as you must do so via the app which is very limited and does not allow for adjustments like seller consessions, etc. Also, was unable to add the cobuyer's info as the app would not accept any email address in the required 2nd email field.",
      "Great idea until it's not! Went to see some houses in a Sunday afternoon. Got to one house, no problem. Second house and the app wouldn't open asking for my license. That would be fine, if it actually worked. But it never does and then it asks you to call. And then I'm on hold for over 3 minutes! No thanks.... like i said, it would be revolutionary if it was consistent and dependable. It's not.",
      "It's nice to have the option of looking at houses without people on top of you trying to make a sale, but twice now we've gone to look at a house and there are people already there. It'd be nice if there was a feature to let you know someone else is touring the house so you don't waste your time driving out and then have to wait however long for people to leave.",
      "Don't even deserve the 1 star. Open door isn't veteran friendly, wouldn't pay even 1% of closing cost with a va loan. As a buyer stay away. The app as a whole is fine and convenient but trying to get a house from them is terrible.",
      "Nothing wrong with the app, but more a gripe against the company. They offered me $30k under the market value for my home, and wanted to charge additional $30k fee to sell my home. I talked to a real estate agent, and he said after listing fees, real estate commissions, and closing costs, my final fee should only be $18k. So if I went with open door, I would have loosed out of $42k. Think about that before doing business with this company."

      "I really love this app, it has some amazing features and functions. The only downside is the music function, it's difficult to scroll through your music to find the exact song you want to play. If you could play straight from your music app it would be perfect. I do understand you can use the microphone option but it doesn't work as well as the music function does. Please roll out an update that makes playing music efficient and optimal. Thank you!",
      "Have critical problem. I connect the USB WiFi led controller with Sony Android TV, everything is going well until I turn off the tv. an hour later, the led starts flashing and it is reset. Not sure what happen but as I know, my tv isn't turn off completely. It is just stand by and wake up to check update in background. There isn't acceptable solution found now. Only solution is unplug my tv.",
      "keeps disconnecting randomly, wont go online no matter what (changed the cloud server and other stuff but nothing works.) you can still toggle light on off using the app but not google assistant",
      "Controller works well. But it just lacks so much functionality for addressable LEDs. Search SP108e on YouTube for examples of what a decent controller can do. I regret this purchase.",
      "Really great app and gets the job done and easy colour switch. Sadly the custom colour change functions seem to have stopped working recently though"

      "Nice game. I only enjoy games as most other people when said games have the least amount of ads/interruptions while in progress with a game. After 2 level completions there's a pop up ad for 30 secs. before going to the next level. Often times more so. Sorry but this does not enhance the enjoyment of a majority of the games that are available on Google Store. Hence as to my rating. I will keep it that way until for the majority of Google Store there games there is more interactive playing time of levels before a pop up ad.",
      "It's a good game, but would be better if things weren't so expensive as you have to play loads of times just to buy one thing & that' s with doubling value. Also sometimes you have to watch an ad twice to get the reward",
      "This old Game app has the potential to be Great! But unfortunately, the gameplay is glicthy, Full of bugs so much until the ads do not have. Chance to express their products with out piping up. To the developer: Please update this game. Because it has a lot of promise. Thank you!👍",
      "This is a nice concept. However, there are bugs that need fixing. Videos wont run for ads and some levels act as if you never played them even when you did. Deleting for now. Will check at a later time and see if you all fix it. This could be a very good game.",
      "Love this game! Only problem I have is it freezes, then I have to close game and start all over again."

      "Prices displayed are deceiving/misrepresented of \"actual price\" . For example: when shopping bed frames, when you select the size of bed frame (like a king) then select the color, it will show you the price of the full (but doesn't indicate this anywhere on the screen. I had to call customer service who snottingly advised me of this and offered no apologies). Then when you select the color, on the main screen it will show the \"actual price\".",
      "This app used to work fantastic. Unfortunately after multiple updates it has become nothing more than wasted space on my mobile device. As many other people have mentioned 95% of the time it will not load any searches. Will not allow to scroll photos but only enlarges the initial photo as well. I have had some great experiences with Wayfair but this app has forced me on many occasions in the last few weeks to make my purchases elsewhere. I have deleted/ redownloaded as well as much more.",
      "Not sure what happened to this app but I can no longer view any of the color selections. No matter what option I select the photo doesn't change. Please fix this. Buying online from stock photos is already a gamble but not being to preview a color sample is just bad. I've used this app many times and have had no other issues until recently with this problem.",
      "Very cumbersome and slow to use in all aspects: searching for items, filtering items, accessing orders, viewing the cart, etc. The only thing that happens quickly is placing an order. However, it happens so quickly that you don't get to review items or delivery options.",
      "Slow loading, can't track my package unless I go through my email and track it that way, in today's world of next day delivery I have to wait two and a half weeks for a shelf. I won't be using Wayfair anymore I think, as it feels dated and old. Like I am ordering from a Sears catalog. I don't have a screenshot Don't know the version nor care And it's a huawei"

      "Convenient app. It took 3 months to make it work with my At&T internet and Samsung S10 phone. I continued to receive \"no internet connection messages\". I was finally sucessful oneday. I don't know what I did differently but, the app finally connected! Now, for me I still receive \"no internet connection\" messages on my Samsung S10 if I don't close all the windows on my phone prior to pulling up the app. Other than that I enjoy the app.",
      "We have constant issues with the geofence not engaging properly. Lately we've been having issues where we'll turn the heater completely off and the app will turn it back to heating mode on it's own. We've also been having issues with it increasing the temperature and not turning off when you lower it back down. Exp: it's set at 69 will switch to 77 out of no where. We'll turn it back down to 69 but the heater will keep running until you switch it to off completely.",
      "Takes you round in circles , says turn on airplane mode then complains no Internet connection. Will not import existing TCC setup even though it says it can. Says seven day support on website but is only weekdays so as usual if your a home owner stuck with it good luck getting tech support. Coders apparently are unable to make one app that works for all. So far a real joke like phillips wiz lighting.",
      "Geofence has failed and app not communicating with thermostat anymore. Can't use the app to set temperature anymore ever since this last update. Using a T5 lyric. Why you folks messed up the app? It was working perfectly. After updates, looks like we need to reset wifi and it works perfectly again.",
      "This app is a really great concept if it work. It is really complicated to connect to the thermostat. Also when I change the temp it doesn't change! When I try to turn the thermostat off it stays on. Very frustrating"

      "Absolutely horrible. To switch internet on or off on a specific device takes FOREVER. Plus, they are down for maintenance or the app isn't working quite frequently. Which means if you need to turn the internet back on and you are locked out, then you are screwed. The whole app isn't user friendly either. This is my LEAST functioning app out of all the apps on my phone.",
      "Love using this app. The best home internet manager app I have ever used. It's very easy to use and allows me to control everything to do with my home wifi internet. If I do end up needing any help, the customer support was great and able to explain things clearly and made things so easy. Thank you",
      "Update: Received email from app representative after I contacted them. They gave two recommendations to try. I let them know they didn't work. Never heard back from them. Worked great previously. Now it says my internet is offline, when it's not. Been saying this for a few months now. I've called to have it fixed and still the same issue. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, still nothing. This app is useless at this point.",
      "Really sorry that I updated this app. I used to be able to control how many hours of internet my children could have on their device profile. It still shows the time limit, but there's no way to adjust it. Maybe this is a bug to fix? It is a great feature that I hope you aren't deprecating. Without it, this app is worthless to me. Please fix and I'll be happy to change my review.",
      "Awful!!!! It doesnt work it's either not recognizing my user ID or says temporarily unavailable. I can't transfer my replacement gateway without having the app. I called customer service twice they couldn't find a solution. So I'm left with a nonfunctioning app and if I want a tech to come make the transfer then I would be charged for that visit. I am currently looking for another provider that cares about their good paying customers and don't have a problem lending a helping hand. Disappointed"

      "Overall I enjoyed the game and completed the levels available. Main complaint is the actions. you have to look directly at whatever you're doing or it won't work. I'm happy there were multiple graphics level options. The other thing I didn't like was that wall/floor tiles were just stretched, so nothing looks even. Also some areas are broken and instead of painting a wall, you'll paint a window, and you can't undo it. I love the concept. I'd prefer a click-to-do-action and wait instead of hold.",
      "For those who can't find 20th dirt on horror house. It's on a wall. Go up stairs turn left, turn left again (so stairs are on your left), then turn right (Stairs behind you), walk straight and turn around so facing steps. Walk towards steps, it's on your left. Hope that helps!!!",
      "Lots of potential. There are some bugs that need to be fixed. Sometimes during a mission, the counter doesn't work properly. Theres also one where when you finish furnishing a house to flip, it just goes back to the PC and you dont actually flip the house. Aside from that, maybe fixing the textures and getting more missions would be good.",
      "Love it, so happy it works! I never have left a review before but decided this game needs more support. It works amazing for me so far and I have so much fun with it I can't put my tablet down.",

App Drawer - make it resizeable even When list is turned off. the icons are too big for my tablet, hence need a resize option. 2. App Drawer - When apps are grouped into categories(e.g. Letters).Make the Category Label just above the apps at the top of each group instead of being as big as the icons 3. Animation for app opening can be optimized. they are slow and pauses for a bit compared to native animation.",
      "The app was a clear cut 5 star. Recently, the app froze. When it unfroze, there are widgets that can no longer be moved off the home screen. It is still functional, but the problem with me being stuck with widgets in my home screen that I don't want is an issue.",
      "This is my launcher. But the app drawer is a mess. I hate it immensely. May suggest that you look at \"3D Live Launcher\" and do something similar. That is, square home 3 should be able to categorize the apps on someone's phone and move the apps into the relevant folders created by the launcher. Plz stop spending so much time fixing minor bugs and get the app drawer right... Why is it that when the background in the apps draw is dark, the app labels are also dark thus rendering them unreadable?",
      "Closest I've used to an actual Windows interface! If the tiles were more active like windows, we'd be in business! Update* OK-you've done it. 5 stars! Tiles are quite active and also have the ability to add multiple home screens! Do not stop supporting this app! Thanks team!",

      "At first I liked this game. These are the types I love to play. However, the game is slow. You go to shoot the bubbles and it either freezes or its delayed. Then you purchase the \" super \" aim. The super aim is horrible. It does not aim at all. Just bounces off the wall sometimes. Not what I consider by playing other games as super aim. Super aim to me means that you can get close to the bubble you want to hit. Ended up deleting the game.",
      "Well I love this mafia family but the speed of the game is extremely slow. Bubbles take too long to hit target, there's no pinpoint directional arrow to hit bubbles, which is becoming a standard function in other games. I just started and it's rather a low-level bubble game. And PS your original Home game is constantly freezing. This'll be a fun series if you upgrade and remove the glitches.",
      "This would be a really fun game if you could rotate the screen gives you more room for playing and decorating if you can rotate the screen then i would download the game i love these games when you can decorate but i like the match 3 build your own.",
      "The cat throw bubble to slow it take long plus it freeze alots but i love the game and decor",
      "even though the game is interesting ,I fill it's can be slow,frustrating and doesn't have smooth graphics.otherwise ok"

      "I like the app for the idea that it implements devices from different manufacturers.. It's annoying to add app after app to my phone and account after account for different types of devices. That's put me off from buying more smart home devices. Links to Wink and Harmony work well. Philips Hue defaults to Rooms not lights. That's similar to their app but would be nice if we could separate them to see individual lights in a Group. Unfortunately Etekcity is not a supported device type (yet?). Sometimes there is some delay getting device status and changing settings. Might just be my old phone. I don't understand how it enables Alexa. I expect to find a Skill from Amazon. I'm comfortable giving Amazon my login to your app for account linking, but not comfortable giving your app my login to Amazon. I don't know who you are or whether you might be intent on trying to control my home so it was difficult enough for me to enter my logins for my devices.. I took it on faith that you really aren't sending that data from my device as is promised in your Privacy Policy. But I just can't trust this app with my Amazon account. This would be key for me to purchase the app. The Designer is pretty cool. Lots of power to personalize the app to control your own home. This could allow individual Philips Hue lights in a group. The Designer is worth it if you like to twiddle bits. But it's also a bit of a time suck. Especially difficult since I couldn't download more examples from the web site. Fortunately the Page Templates helped me get started.",
      "Works faster than the official Wemo app! I use this on my Windows pc also, its just as slick on that platform. It found my 10 Wemo devices, also my Smartthings hub (which controls my front door lock). Can't even do that from the Google assistant. I use this pretty much every day. 4 stars only because it doesn't display the 2 Wemo Insight plugs correctly on either platform. I just downloaded the designer program, trying to figure that out, but the examples are missing.",
      "After the 12 2019 update it crashed at start. After the 3.0.5 update the app is working fine. I use it to control my knx lighting from Windows PC and Android phone and it does a great job on both, although it can do mutch more than that. Thanks for the great app and support!!!!",
      "Works as advertised and free. More powerful than you'd expect from a free app. No Wyze support and that's a problem, widely available at home Depot and their smart plugs, lights cameras and devices are well supported",
      "Works great, will you consider adding support for TpLink's new range of \"Tapo\" devices."

      "I love the game. Odd that you have to spin the wheel to get money instead of just taking the money from levels but nothing that will stop me from playing. Kudos to the dev's in the game after the update, the gifts were nice and made switching all of my furniture back not too terrible.",
      "The update makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Suddenly, There's a mansion sitting in the front of everything and I would like to know why. Also there are new selections of the upgrades I selected previously. Although it is the same game it feels as if I am playing in someone else's account. The update is extremely mysterious and bazaar. Pump the breaks on the nuances developers. No shade, just strange. Also how many games can you compile into one? Find out playing \"Home Master!\"",
      "It's a good take on the normal building games. The latest update wasn't really an update. A large mansion which seems to serve no purpose. The daily tasks are almost impossible to get without spending a lot of money on boosts. That is , if the restaurants actually give you the tasks you need. I played alot yesterday to get dishes to complete my task. Only got coins, or likes with no opportunity to complete the dish task.",
      "Im tired to reporting the bug in this game. First i cant visit someone's house. Second, the game is slow as hell, freezing, then close by itself. When i watch a video to get a chance , i got nothing. And now , i cant give anything to the first customer. And when i got perfect dig im not getting any bonus. Please fix it. If i dont get any response till a week, im uninstall.",
      "I really liked this game when I started playing it then they did the updates. I cannot get any of the new areas open it says download and when you do nothing. There is no reason to play it anymore since you can't advance to any other areas. The areas that are open are all completed. I did uninstalled and then reinstalled the game hoping it would help it. It did not, I reached out via the game in the help section asking for the issue to be looked into nothing."

      "Its an alright app, what would be really helpful is, that if the app synced with your calendar on your phone verses having to constantly open the app to look at the showings, date and time. Force the app for the realtor showing the home to comment on the showing (intrested/not intrested) and also have a conpleted option to let the home owner know that they are done. Another thing that would be great is a \"no show\" option for the seller to notify both the sellers realtor and the buyers realtor.",

      "This app is great, when it works. Unfortunately, that's not very often. Constantly glitches, error message after error message. Usually can't even get past the home screen. When I am able to, it's not for more than 5 minutes before it starts creating crazy errors. Using a Google Pixel 3 with most current OS. Everything up to date and no issues with other apps. (so I shop on those instead).",
      "I never have an issue with the app. I use it on my Samsung android just for reference. It is very good at connecting with your email for orders and updates. Tracking numbers are almost instant and accurate. Get Beyond + as well. It is seriously worth it.",
      "Don't know what's going on. I've tried several times to update this app and all it does is spin. Had no problem with it until I had to update it, which it won't do Useless, so I guess I have to ho directly to the website in order to browse and make a purchase I just uninstalled the app and tried to reinstall it. Same thing, it just spins and spins, won't do anything. App is useless",
      "I downloaded this app for the sole purpose of using it for my wedding registry and it doesn't work. Registry screen just spins and spins (yes I verified I was on wifi, also tried just using data). When you click Manage Registry it just reloads the same search page you're on (yes, I verified that I actually created the registry). It seems like a really great app... if it worked.",
      "Won't let me log in and on entering my email address for offers it wastes a few minutes of my time, then tells me I'm offline. News to me since I had full signal and all other apps work. Waste of time and effort. Forces me to go to customer service for them to print my membership for the cashier. Big waste of time!"

      "The app was super helpful with pulling rentals wherein the contacts actually respond and for the most part the listings are very current. The map feature isn't the best because it doesn't allow zoom in/out. So you better be very familiar with neighborhood streets or type address into another maps app for use of zooming feature.",
      "I don't like that I can't just choose apartments or townhouse, they are bundled together, giving me more work to do and wasting time. Also, why every couple of days I open the app and it has an address in New York as my latest search? I'm looking in south Florida! update: now it has either NY address or if I, again, manually delete it, it gives me an address in the worst neighborhood in south Florida. That's when I click on the new listings notification icon! Ugh"

      "It's a good app but here's the problem, every one of these listings has the option to contact a real estate agent. These agents send you emails that try to lead you away from Zillow to their own websites & their own listings. Instead of contacting the rental management directly, a person could waste vital time messing with these real estate agents. The problem is that most of the rental management cannot be contacted by any other means. Believe me, I tried & got nothing but voicemail.",
      "Can't contact properties through the app because my keyboard doesn't pop up for the fillable fields... Good as useless. And I need an account to do anything? No thanks.",
      "Locations of properties are bundled together in one place. Easy to read, highlighted always accurate. This app refreshes itself with current houses,condos apartments... It even has a filter allowing you to only view properties of your unique interest. Take notice of image providing indoor/outdoor and street view of ea. property. Nearest schools, location, even crime rates. Expensive properties include sq.ft/ fence/yard/finished bm/younger. Yet Oldies have great main level updates as well.",
      "Compared to some of the other rental search apps Zillow is conveniently successful making the search and application process a breeze. Every rental property has a sensible amount of info in the details, all the necessary elements are in place and it is easy to use, can easily contact the property manager or landlord for every listing available. It is also a great app for those with wanderlust, just browsing the photos of random houses for rent all over the country, just daydreaming.",
      "I've been looking in areas that have a lot of senior 55 plus housing and I wish there was a way to hide them, town I'm currently moving to seems like more than 80% of the available housing is senior housing and it makes it very difficult you need to find a way to eliminate senior housing if needed."

      "29/01/2020 I updated the Home Network System App on my phone and it is working!! Thank you for fixing what was wrong. 24/9/2019 I am very disappointed. Could only use WPS to connect the Hub to the Wifi. None of the connection steps via the Home Network System App works. So, waste of money and time, for no connection to app, no view from cameras or any other use.",
      "This monitoring system has so much potential. It has all the features you want in a security system and more. However, connecting through your cell phone signal is nearly impossible. There's no rhyme or reason but it works whenever it wants to which is almost never. When connected through Wi-Fi it works just fine which is pointless because you want it to work when you are remote. It's so frustrating and there's no way to communicate with Panasonic.",
      "I was out of Country and Panasonic Home app started working with 4g lte. It wasn't working with T-Mobile in U.S.A. To fix this issue, Tap Settings > Connections >Tap Mobile networks >Tap Access Point Names. Tap the name of the Access Point. If you see APN protocol set to IPv6, you found the problem. IPv6 is preventing app to connect to the Panasonic Servers. Most companies switched completely to IPv6 protocol. Set APN protocol to IPv4/IPv6 or IPv4 if you don't have IPv4/IPv6 option. Don't forget to save setting after making changes. If you are not able to change or option is greyed, then add new access point from menu and copy all the settings of original access point but change APN protocol:IPv4/IPv6 or IPv4. After saving new access point make sure to select the access point you just created. After changing settings on my phone i don't have any problem connecting to servers when i am away from home and i like this system again. If you don't know how to change, google how to change access point on your phone, also it should be on your service provider website. You can call service provider or take your phone to service provider store and tell them to change the settings for you.Please mark helpful to help others, also don't forget to update the app rating. Good Luck.",
      "From the last update it wont work reconnect when i get back home(exit app and then open again. This with android 8). A couple of days ago i've change my phone(android 9). Now it works only on wifi, but....no longer on mobile data !!!!!! IS NO LONGER WORKING ON MOBILE DATA WITH ANDROID 9 !!!!!! If you not fix this I will never ever buy a Panasonic product (I have a couple) Shame on you, there is a lot of people who has that problem. Update: not working with android10(mobile data).",
      "The whole system is worthless rubbish! I paid $269 for Camera and Hub and whilst I manage to get everything running after several frustrating attempts, the CCTV camera starts recording intruders with a delay. USELESS! Based on this experience I will not imvest in any other Panasonic product!"

      "I would give this app a five star if the develper adds roofing, compound and some cars. And also update some tools in the editing panel like adding elevators and you know some modern things cause it seems the items are old. Also in 3D I would be glad if you are able to close and open doors, ability to turn lights on and off. And lastly ability to build underground basements or apartments. But in all this app is good and will be perfect if you include these listed points in the future update.",
      "This is the best phone based plan app, period!! I am a project manager and having the ability to create a floorplan, export / send it instantly is worth while. The floor plans are compatible with AutoCAD which is extremely valuable as well. ROI on your 1st plan! It is user-friendly and the functions are fairly intuitive. If your in need of the services this App provides don't look any further. I was using Magic Plan ($99 a year subscription). Floor Plan Creator is the best in class for sure!!",
      "This is a very fun app to create spaces on, I'm not professional, I just like it for the creativity and as an all round fun app to use I don't really need the export feature but I'm still going to buy full version for the support. the bad comments are just people who didn't pay attention to the warning at the start regarding exports png etc",
      "I love it. I have always been looking for a app to design a home, but they all need money. This one however doesnt. I can design what I want with the free version, and am not forced to pay. Only suggestion is a better zoom/walk around for the 3d. Otherwise great app, definitley worth getting!!",
      "This is an extraordinarily helpful app. I used it for planning my bedroom while I was cleaning it out, and it helped me decide between tons of minor things like, how do I want the bed rotated, will my desk be against the window or not, and all sorts of things. Can't recommend it enough."

As with most of the HA stable, it's a little 'nerdy' and not very well documented (yes, i know i can change the docs myself). 30 minutes after setting it up, i had it working remotely AND generating Zone triggers! Now if i could work out how to get the notifications coming thru Android Auto ...",

Played levels to place the rack, its still in the middle of the kitchen!!! Now, I have to play 3 levels so they can take a walk!!!!! I am considering uninstalling this game!!!!!",
      "I'll be in midst of a game, have two or more battery pieces, the game just up and decides to remove one that I just earned. Not because I used it. It just disappeared. Another game later, I have a match that'll earn a bomb piece and it only matched the 3 lower green pieces and not the top two of the match. Highly pissed at the game and uninstalling at this point. Was suppose to entertain and all it does it upset me.",
      "First it would be grate if you can remove the Christmas stuff. Long gone. Level 75 is so dif. to pass because there to little movements for such a big puzzle. Sitting for hours trying to pass level 75 and some others aswell. Otherwise a very enjoyable game. Thanks.",
      "This used to be my favorite decorating game. The decorations you got to choose from were beautiful. But as you get into more rooms, there is less decorating, less choices. The kitchen and dressing room are examples. Very little decorating and a lot of elements you can't change. Now I'm outside and just got enough stars to get a bench. I didn't get a choice in what the bench looks like. Very frustrating.",
      "It's an ok game. Pretty much the same as all the others like it. Really hate how all these games make you use a star for dumb stuff like \"feed the cat\" or \"open package\". Mostly it's enjoyable until you get to the levels that are just so hard to beat it becomes near impossible. Also, the treasure chest that pops up and covers the game board is annoying as hell."

      "I have loved this game more then any other game. But there will be no more chapters added, I messaged developers on Facebook and that's what they told me. So I continued to play anyway, trying to get 5 stars on every room. But sometimes you design particular rooms 50 or more different times and you never get 5 stars. So unfortunately I'm quitting the game. There is lots of bogus voting that goes on. A lot of the voters profiles are fake.",
      "I like the game but every time I go to the next room it is totally broke up into pixels. For mostofthem I had to reboot the game. I'm on level 5 it's broken up too and not even a reboot will fix it. If it can't be fixed I'm going to uninstall it.",
      "Facebook account is required to play long term! Didn't know that. Lost significant data twice and now I can't login!! Won't allow data to be saved via Google Play account. Wrote to the developers. Wrote 2 other reviews. NO HELP!! NO ANSWERS!! Past disappointed and fed up with the disappointments!!! DELETED game regardless of quality, graphics, and the fact it WAS my favorite design game with lots of my own earned furniture! Don't waste your time!! If you run into problems, you're on your own!"

      "Easy to use and it's Free really Free not pay a dollar now and $40 after every month and there pretty up to date I look at a lot of sites it knowledge my self",
      "I would rate it higher if the pictures actually loaded. I've only had it downloaded 5 minutes and I'm annoyed with the fact that many of the pictures are not loading. That's definitely an important feature to have working when it comes to people house hunting. I notice I'm not the only one that's mentioned the issue, as well. But, it seems it is impossible to find a list of local foreclosures online (for free), so this is the only option I have found thus far. PLEASE fix this issue.",
      "Very informative. The places they show are usually fairly nice, but there are a few that are very old and not well maintained. All in all my experience with Cash Net USA has been good. I had a loan with them once before and it went fairly well. That was over ten yeats ago I believe.",
      "Only shows the most expensive listings first, without the ability to refine the kind of results so parking spaces show up, and the UI is very childish",
      "I like this app. I usually have to look up a state map that outline the state's map by counties. That is easy and once you have an idea which county in the state your looking for it is easy to find nice, reasonably priced homes. The homes that I find are rarely torn up and at good prices. It definitely makes a home search so easy!"
