      "I know there is the Covid-19 virus going around, and of course the phones are busy, but why doesn't the app or the website let me cancel online? I have been trying since 8 am and I keep getting this error message: This is a new reservation and is currently in progress, please try again after 30 minutes if you wish to cancel. I made this reservation 2 weeks ago. It's now 4 pm and I have until 6 pm or the hotel charges me, non refundable. Fun? No. Can I give 0 stars?",
      "The actual act of reserving rooms at a later date is not as intuitive as it could be. A nice bright button on the home page after signing onto the app would be great, BOOK ANOTHER? Having said that, the app keeps me logged in, so that may be a problem. There's no readily identifiable way to delete mail after having read it.",
      "Got stuck in the cold after they took money for a reservation. 20 minutes on the phone asking where my confirmation is if the money was held only to be told that the system was \"updating\". On a Saturday night, it was \"updating\". Not enough to completely shut down the app or website, just enough so that it places a hold on your money while leaving you out in the cold waiting for a confirmation or support to answer your call",
      "This site has the worst useless outsourced customer service and lately I've had nothing but screw ups on their end with bookings. After paying much more due to errors they will not fix on their end with room type and billing, I am uninstalling this app. If you have a problem with your booking (and there's a good chance you will using this app) you'll spend an hour talking to a rep in another country who will tell you how they cannot fix the problem. Also you get worst rooms (handicap, no view)",
      "I've been a long time, regular user of this app/site. I booked a room 2 months ago for a room in a month from now. It was non-refundable but that was before COVID-19 & the closure of the border. I'm self-employed & am now out of work. The money I used to booked a room I am definitely NOT going to use due to a closed border should be returned to me as I clearly had nothing to do with travel restrictions. I can't get anyone on the phone or via web chat. How do I get my money back..?"

      "This game is fun and addicting. My only complaint is that there is 5 hotels to complete. I completed them all and spent the $10 to have the manager keep up with my hotel while I was away. For spending $10 on a mobile game, I thought there would be a lot more hotels to complete. Not just 5...",
      "It's pretty much impossible to make any progress without watching copious numbers of adverts - and over £10 for an advert-free version is daylight robbery. They're technically optional but if you want to achieve anything in a reasonable amount of time, you need that extra cash boost - especially because it's not a true idle game. You can have a full hotel, switch to another app, come back a few seconds later and your hotel is half empty. It doesn't properly simulate running in the background.",
      "I like the game and all these other people saying you have to spend money on this game are completely wrong. I have completed 5 hotels to 5 stars without spending any money at all. Yes it takes a while to do it and that is why you have an option to spend money. As for the ads, In order to get double profits, you have to return to your hotel while the multiplier is still on. It also works for every hotel, not just one it brings you to. 4 stars because there are no more hotels as of right now.",
      "I absolutely love this game! I have had ot for quite awhile now and think it is so fun. A bit of a challenge to save your money when upgrading, but a good way to know what a struggle it must be to keep a business perfect for customers! There aren't many ads. The only times you have them is if you accept to am investment deal or more customers. I will keep this game a long time!",
      "This game is good but not much progress. I've been playing this for hours and it's starting to get boring. Watching ads is the best way to progress but it kinda felt like I'm just watching ads and not playing anymore. Although it is a very nice game. The graphics and gameplay is good. Nice choice of characters as well. More updates and maybe this could possibly be one of the best tycoon games or whatever it is called. Lol. Overall, I still like it :)"

      "Terrible. Chat never available. Cancel feature broken. Called multiple times to hear a recording that the service was not available. When I finally got through, the agent uttered I was being unresponsive and quickly hung up while I was talking. She literally gave me 1 second to reply while on hold for over 2 hours. Now I'm stranded outside the country in this crisis because the airline canceled a flight and put me on a connection before the first flight. I'm not a time traveler. Thanks Expedia!",
      "This app sucks, how did it get 4.5 stars? You will NOT GET ANY REFUND if you cancel a flight. You will only get CREDITS can only be redeemed by calling them. You cannot use your credits on the app!!! And they have some technical issues so you cannot call them to book a flight. So your refund money is gone. The app sucks.",
      "DO NOT BOOK TRAVEL WITH THIS APP!!! Due to covid19, we had flights booked. The airline canceled our flights but cannot refund us because we booked with Expedia. Expedia's robotic call system will not allow us to speak to an agent and there is STILL no option on the app for a refund. We are trapped in a foreign country as they have our money and we cannot book another flight. We are not the only ones. UPDATE: Your reply matches Expedia's Mar 12 email, but nothing has changed with ref to refunds.",
      "I found the travel insurance that is offered to be useless in the face of a real emergency. I purchased my trip long before the COVID virus was announced. I am outraged that the travel insurance company was allowed to add a bunch of exclusions concerning COVID-19 long after my purchase. AIG altered the policy to avoid paying out. In my opinion, the insurance offered is a scam.",

Not only that, the representative for Priceline stated that I would receive a call in 15 mins. 45 minutes has passed by, and no call. Please reframe from using this application and Priceline in general. They are a rip off, and only about the company policy. Unbelievable",
      "This app seems more for buying a new trip then tracking one. I love priceline and all the people in custermer support, the deals, updates in the email but the app is not geered for that service. It seems to really want bew business. I am un installing it.",
      "There were a few problems I experienced while trying to book this same room for a second night. But I think its because I am not familiar with doing things for myself eith today's technology. But I think \"Yeah, I Got This\" now. It's great yo know one can save so much time and money with such ease!!",
      "I used like 5 different apps back and forth trying to find a decent flight, and this one ended up being not only the easiest, but definitely the cheapest. Doesn't direct you to another site to book, and you individually choose departure and return flight. Super helpful and informative.",
      "It's great except using it for flight. The date of birth is not the most efficient. Scrolling several pages to get to my birth year was ridiculous. At the end, it kept the correct month and date but stayed with 1990. I tried three times. It needs to be fixed. Other apps use easier ways to get dob."

My username is Ryufengg and I'm not able to edit my bio or username. Please help fix the glitch, Thank you very much. Sincerely ..",
      "This is amazing game i recommended this for all because we can can fight with friend,buy new clothes ,play with friends, dancing, and adventure in secret rooms ,and there will a daily reward to buy clothes like diamonds,coins ,3 clothing gift . And more first when i play this game i don't like because there is only one room its my room and i were grey weird dress but i get coins and i buy clothes and my home is wow!yeah beautiful i have 109 friends . So i recommended this for all",
      "Great Game! There is so many things you can do! One thing that I wish I could do is transfer items, coins, and diamonds from one account to another. Also I wish it was easier to get coins and diamonds. Another thing is that I wish there was more secret rooms. The main problem is that my game glitches alot. But still, this is still a great game as it is though. I recommend this game to thers, Hotel Hideaway is a great game and I never get bored of it!",
      "I like this game but since few days it stars laggy and then stuck when I'm open my profile on my second avatar...please I don't like this....Please fix it ASAP...and please add more 1 and 2 stars item into the wheel ..MAYBE you can give us on discount for every item in _HH for a week for our quarantine time...😔😔😔please fix the glitch I don't like glitchy..And please add new feature that can be use not useless like reporting...PLEASE READ THIS AND MAKE IT HAPPEN ASAP",
      "I've had the game for over a year and every update they break something important, the staff doesn't listen to the players whatsoever, you go to the support section and you're talking to a very unhelpful bot that repeats the same lines over and over again, theres literally nothing to do but stand around and talk, this game is rated 17+ yet is filled with children, each event that passes the content in the game gets more directed towards children, and it's a glorified popularity game."

      "The Choice privilege program itself is wonderful. Booking in app can be a pain at times. (I have booked online, received confirmation and showed up with no reservation on the hotels end.😒 Luckily my hotel of choice is amazing and all was well!😎😎) Calling is usually much easier and faster. But customer service; all in all, is great!😁",
      "I must say this is a great app, it help when you need to book outside your state. Also, you have a lot of benefits on this app, such as blinding reward points for free nights at an choice hotel location. In conclusion, if you have any problems you can call customer service at anytime for assistance.\" Great app\"...😄😁",
      "Takes about at least 15 minutes at least to do a reservation on phone. App on phone not user friendly. Very hard to understand agent from Choice Hotels. Last booking agent was in Monterey Mexico. Not good.",
      "I love the app! It has little things that I adore. Great prices for hotels that I enjoy staying in, a filter option for not just pools, but indoor pools, the weather forecast for the days of my stay, and the best one...the option to add my reservation to my calendar (this has check in and check out times and the address so I can hit a button and, tada, I'm on my way!)",
      "I don't think I've had one complaint with choice or with the app itself since I very first joined almost a year ago. The app is easy to use and simple to navigate, nothing confusing or extremely complicated. Also, I can honestly only recall once or twice that I had any difficulty with the app loading or connecting. I blame that on the system itself being down perhaps. Whatever the case, I am a very very satisfied customer."

      "Love the app, helps you see the property and areas that are around. Photos are very helpful, and the reviews. It shows the total price for your stay and some properties have pay at the property upon arrival. So you can actually book months in advance although with that option you may pay a little bit more. I'm ok with that cause it allows you to save up for your trip.",
      "used to be great, but this weekend it left us stranded due to double bookings. If you use it, make sure to contact the venue before booking. edit. It's now 8 months later. We again used it a couple of times and over this past weekend they AGAIN double booked us. This time I did contact the venue and they confirmed everything is fine, but upon arrival it obviously wasn't. Save yourself a lot of grief and uninstall",
      "I used this app in 2019 to book my first vacation. I was pleased with the locations I was shown & the options given. There was a smooth flow of communication between the host the app & myself. I was able to cancel with ease I was able to reserve same way and make additional requests. Emails from the hosts came in a timely manner because the feedback thru the app was perfect. As for the pricing I didn't feel I was over charged credit card information was protected. It is user friendly#great app💯",
      "Always makes it fast and easy to find a hotel! And prices are usually cheaper than booking directly through hotel, especially if booking last-minute. And when the hotel has no rooms available to book directly, there are usually some rooms available through this booking site. It also has detailed information regarding the hotels. I use this app a lot! I always end up finding a decent hotel in the end! Thanks so much 😊",
      "I believe the application through TripAdvisor then Google Play to Booking APP download relatively quick. I also was very impressed with the data submitted and quick confirmation via personal email. The special request is based solely on memory but prefer the upstairs. I stayed here in the past but cannot recall the room number but it was definitely upstairs. I hope the breakfast bar improved yet recall the bananas were good. The staff from what I recall very efficient checking into the motel. TY"

      "So far, so good. I just started playing this game and its been fun & relaxing. Sometimes these match tiles games get frustrating when you cant pass a level and so you just end up deleting the game after you've decorated only maybe half of it. So, we'll see if this game becomes too difficult to get anywhere with it. So far I have been enjoying it.",
      "I love the story and designing the hotel, but it is too hard to proceed because most of the obstacles like stars and boxes are at the bottom part and are compressed, and you need to hit them multiple times to clear them, but the number of moves is not enough, and power ups are not so powerful if it takes multiple hit to clear an obstacle",
      "The game was fun until the higher levels, it takes at least 10-20 tries before I get to pass the levels, and the decorations or I should say the story, take at least 3 stars to complete. It's also extremely hard to get money or power ups. Which just makes people frustrated. It's obvious that this is a pay to win game.",
      "Great game! The Disappearing walls are a little awkward and glitchy sometimes but overall that's probably the only problem I saw with graphics. The actual story line is really good and gets a little slow sometimes you can't make tap forward in the conversation you either have to skip it all or sit through the whole thing. Please don't do it so many other games have done and just fled their game with ads every time you turn around. Maybe steal it back a little even make the ads optional for bonus",
      "At first its a great game with a fun storyline. I didnt really mind the fact that it was a copy of Homescapes. But by the time you get to level 37, its impossible to play without spending hundreds of pounds on coins and powerups. Im sick of it. Im just gonna uninstall and get Homescapes instead. And YES I HAD USED UP ALL THE FREE BONUSES"

      "I like the game but i dont know why they have to make the actions so slow , i dont enjoy having to watch a character take forever to walk into a room its unnecessary and time consuming. Speed up the action.",
      "I enjoy the Hotel series of games. But here's a tip - once you start receiving good reviews, don't change things. It's counter-productive. You know the old saying \"if it's not broken, don't fix it\". With that being said, well done!",
      "I enjoy the game, but after an update I cannot access the settings; also I cannot \"connect to server\". I've uninstalled and cleared cache. I join the competition but cannot get my prizes because I cannot connect to the server.",
      "Love this game. But I cant use my keys. I have tried everything i can think of. If it's not fixed soon i will be deleting the game. There is no point in playing if you cant move forward.",
      "Fun and additive game! Love the concept! Would give it 5 stars if we received coins for extra moves left over! Especialy when we have to pay for certain items. And filling the safe and only getting 10-20 coins just is not enough to buy extra lives and items to renovate the hotel! Might play a little longer and if nothing changes i just delete."

      "I use to like this game but then it became very difficult. They have made it very difficult to get Radars and other special equipment. Also my friend on a Mac OS has the option to watch a video to continue playing when her time has finished and i dont have this option on Android which is highley unfair. Please give us the option to watch a video to continue playing as well.",
      "At first it was great. But now as I'm progressing it feels like this game is cheating on me!!!! When I reach 98% to fill up the star to get a key and wait for the energy refill, so i can get remaining 2%, the whole progress is gone and it starts with 0%. Wth!! And besides that at first it would take only 3-4 levels of searching things to fill the star but now even 5-6 turns are less to fill 100 points.... I'm really getting tired of this and its disappointing! Even touch is not quite accurate!",
      "Edit * I noticed it was another mode added. I'll bump my star rating to four but to charge 950 coins for an extra 45 seconds is obscene. Especially when you only win 10-20 coins per round... 3-21-20 *How can I change it from hard mode? I haven't played since last year so I'm rusty and cannot find all of the objects in under a minute. Help!",
      "Now the game is taking ages to load and once finally in the game, it pauses for 5 seconds exactly every two minutes. Odd? It's clearly not my device. There are currently many complaints of this nature on rating sites. I don't wish to email you and receive a copy-paste reply about clearing my cache (which I've done & my device is optimized). I want to give this app a high rating - despite the awful storyline, glitches and bad grammar, I really enjoy the hidden object scenes for the most part.",
      "Beyond upset. I had gotten pretty far, again, but then it just dropped me down to day 7! I was even connected to Facebook. I tried to reinstall it and it still wont bring the diary day up to the correct task day! This happened once before. I deleted, and then decided to try again. I got even further. . . Then this happens!! What the hell?!? I don't want to keep making progress, just to be dropped down again! Fix it!"

      "The gameplay is neat, the levels sometimes challenging, cute graphics, nice music. Sadly, the game becomes unplayable after a while. There is a lot of ads in the game and quite a few bugs. Sometimes touch sensitivity is very weak but the worst is how often it freezes, espacially in combination with ads. Tgere are obligatory ads to play special levels, after and before levels and even these freeze the game very regularly. Am deleting it now.",
      "Fun, but the ads are too long for how frequent they are",
      "Good game but far too many advertisements that last far too long and spoils the experience Also, if you quit the game it will not open again and you have to uninstall and start from scratch, which definately is a big no no. Also a note for the developers, the advertisement for fishdom corrupts the game and wont let you revive, it's happened quite a few times now, it's the one with the fan, boot and shark please stop using this Ad.",
      "This game is awesome you can do parkour and also you can win rewards it's awesome you should totally play it like one side of my brother cuz it was so bad for him but like I love it he's not going to park or anyway so no need to talk about him this game is so awesome I wish I could play it everyday if I can play it everyday that would be awesome no one would be bothering me while I'm playing Hotel Transylvania adventures and like awesome you should totally play it",
      "Good game untill you reach some levels you cannot play because of the ads. You are obliged to watch ads in order to enter a new level and sometimes there are no videos available to show so you can't play. I unistalled it because of this."

The app comparison fails (or in the case of an e-mail address gives an error \"invalid e-mail address\"). Finding an existing reservation / confirmation number takes WAY too long. Spnning, spinning, spinning.......",

      "This app is really great but I would love a rating system to be put in place. I've encountered hotels who look nothing like their picture and its just disappointing. One of the hotel I went to looked decent from the picture but the floor was all dusty, the aircon wasnt working(no air con remote either) and no tv remote.",
      "I get what people are saying about price per day use vs. the normal overnight reservation but when there are no other options available to you this app fills this particular space nicely. I'm sure as time and competition increase so will better prices and options. For now, great app. Thank you.",
      "Prices aren't much lower than for the whole night!",
      "Love the DayUse App, I travel a lot for work and manage fatigue by using day stay accommodation in Melbourne 3-4 times a month. The app makes it so quick and easy to find the right accommodation for the right price and that hours that suit. A++++",
      "Comes in clutch everytime. So far it's my favorite hotel booking app"

      "This app is very confusing and it doesn't feel good to use it. One example is if you want sort price from low to high, the app shows \"deals\" that it thinks you should see rather than what you asked to see (low to high). When I do find a place I want to look at it is very bloated and I don't feel sure I will get what I want or what agoda wants me to get.",
      "Awful! Latest update is buggy, search for hotel in a specific location but doesn't even work. This is your core feature. Can't you get your QA work on the app to be more useful? Plus the feature on mobile is outdated, you cannot even provide a search for nationality while booking. Actually I thought your team could work better but this is absolutely disappointing. Where can I rollback to older version which it's not as horrible as this one?",
      "Crappy, crappy app!!! Agoda application is very poorly designed. I tried to email customer service from it, and I was not able to enter my booking number, and it is a required field! Also, if I left to get the booking number from this email, your app page would reload and I would loose all the information! Whoever designed this app has not done proper testing (I work in IT for over 20 years...). Use the Booking app instead!",
      "Agoda gave a great price. But, when I wanted to pay, they said that the VA.Number is expired. What was that meaning? I've tried 4 times and it still didn't work at all, I still cannot pay the hotels. I hope that u can improve ur services to customers. Great price is nothing when u didnt have a great and useful services & apps.",
      "I'm very disappointed with the service ... I've successfully booked a room, but I received email that my payment hasn't been received, even though I paid in full. in the email, I've 24 hours to contact, if not confirm, the booking will be canceled. When I contact customer service Jakarta (Indonesia) there is no answer, until the pulse runs out of 50,000 no one gives explanation, just wait and wait until my pulse runs out! Very Upset!"

Thanks Wyndan, GREAT JOB!!!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!",
      "Horrible!!! Made reservation using app and it changed dates on me! Couldn't modify reservation as it was 10:40pm the night before I wanted to use my reward points. Tried contacting Member services as soon as I noticed the error but nobody would help me as it was close to the office closing. So I get charged twice for the same day. NEVER AGAIN!",
      "Doesn't allow one to set up, log in or use the app. I think the app was developed in 1998 as it's very similar to the snake game where you just chase your tail for hours but never actually achieve anything. Useless junk",
      "Other Hotel Chain Apps of todays user are great while this app is 25 year behind. User cannot look up location and add reservation. USER MUST CALL THE 800 NUMBER, an additional use of valuable time many business travelers do not have! Ability to select room based on reservation and rewards tier level is not there. Past stays and activity do not show up as this goes back to the first issue. This company has an Edison Complex as they take credit for other peoples work.",
      "Wonderful ... Tried most and Wyndham Rewards just always comes out on top as best hotel/travel app. That's just the way it is ... Don't just take my word for it ... Try/test it yourself and see what ya think. I'm certain you'll agree Wyndham Rewards, unparralelled"

      "Reservation made easy. I called Marriott reservations, first, it was suggested to use the Bonvoy app, because I'd get a better room rate. I saved $20.00 per night (3 night) using the Bonvoy app. Looking forward to my stay in Sept. I always enjoy my stay at the Atlanta Marriott Gateway.",
      "Probably the best hotel app out there. Small suggestion: at times my wife arrives without me at check-in, and it would be nice to add her info as a guest - as it stands my only option is to call the hotel after I book to add her to the reservation, so it kind of breaks the otherwise seamless in-app booking process.",
      "Junk ...I am a new customer and my 1st impression is that they do not have employees or contractors that know what they are doing. This app is a nightmare & will effect their public relations in a very negative way until Marriott takes responsibility to make the app work. I think it is a horrible way to begin a relationship with a potential new client with an app that creates a negative image around the brand. Horrific.",
      "Love the interface. The transitions are so smooth and using it is very intuitive. Using the app to book a room is a delight. It might sound like I am getting paid for this review but I am not, I just like this app.",
      "Logging into this app is the worst! Always tells me I entered the wrong info, NO I DIDN'T!! It's too time consuming. Have to dig through emails to confirm my member number, recreate ridiculously high security passwords. Hey, Marriott your a hotel brand not a frickin financial institution. So dumb!!!"

      "Very easy to navigate and find multiple rates in different locations. This app is much more user friendly than other travel apps. App is wonderful when it decides it wants to work. Digital key is either best feature or absolute worst. Some hotels, it works with 0 issues. Others, I stand right next to the door and it won't recognize that I'm in range to unlock it.",
      "App used to work! Now it consistently crashes! I tried to make a hotel reservation and it crashed repeatedly! I got on the internet and got a phone number for what I thought was the Hampton Inn in Wytheville, VA where I wanted to stay! I made the reservation but when I arrived, they said that I made the reservation through a 3rd party and I didn't get my points for the stay!",
      "I absolutely love this hotel!! Amazing! The people who work here are awesome also! If I could get my own permanent room, I'd do it. It really does feel like home. Would give 100 stars if I could. It rocks here. I wish they could do something bout the pool area...discount? Free night after 5 nights? Family movie night? Game night? Craft night? Story night?",
      "The Hilton App is one of the easiest to use and offers great rates. Saving preferences and offering the option of self check in and room selection takes the worry out of travelling. For business travel it is great being able to get the same room to stay in the same room. Easy to navigate and lots of good ideas on vacation options.",
      "It's a very convenient way to book reservations. You can look at rates and locations to events and restaurants. However, I want to use my points at time I book my stay. It seems to be more difficult to use points for discounts than when I first joined the Hilton Honors."

And OYO said that just Sorry",

      "Aggravating!! Game is very fun but has 2 long ads per level you play and constantly has glitches I'm now on level 2 and I still watched both ads with no issues but when I try to play the game it completely freezes and is unplayable no matter what I do. I really hope these issues get fixed because I really do enjoy playing this game otherwise",
      "Too many ads! I played this same game many years ago. I really enjoyed it. I am ok with ONE 30 second add between levels but 2. Come on, that is just greedy. This is a very old game. Not worthy of a freaking 1 minute combined commerical between each level. Please do not reply with the same canned response you gave the last complaints. Thank you.",
      "Why I can't move my level? I'm always stuck in level 4-2 where the chambermaid doesn't come out and and the furniture are in disarranged. Could you fix this bug in this game? I'm interested at this first but then it always bugs.",
      "It's quite good: challenging enough that it's not boring. The graphics and controls are okay, but I do wish it was less sensitive(?) because I accidentally press the wrong object quite a lot. I don't have problems with watching ads to continue playing. Besides, you can also pay for the levels for a small price. Overall a good game.",
      "It was a super fun flashback to me until I got to level 4-2 and it glitches out so the wine bar blocks a door, I can't call on the maid and when Jane goes into the kitchen she doesn't come back. I'm very happy that I sat through the seemingly endless ads instead of purchasing since there was a glitch that makes the game unplayable so far into the story. I may try the second one, but 2 ads per level is too much to keep my interest through 2 games and I won't purchase a glitchy game."

      "A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. ...

Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms.A good app cheap hotels very superbbbbb.",
      "Hotels can contain hundreds of rooms and several floors; they generally have staircases, elevators and internal corridors that lead to the rooms. Motels commonly have a one- or two-floor layout and guests access their rooms directly from the parking lot. ... Motelstypically have a more utilitarian construction.",

I was told this app was garbage but didn't listen. Lesson learned!! Hopefully nobody else has to go through this. Book airlines and hotels on your own through Google and save the headache",
      "Booking was easy. Good luck with customer support. I've been trying to call for 2 days now with no response. I can't even get a hold of a real person and the AI support just keeps sending me on a loop so I can't cancel my flight. Once this trip is settled I'm never using this again",
      "Incredibly frustrating to try and cancel a reservation using this app. In fact, it was actually impossible for me. I ended up having to cancel the hotel and the flight individually with the providers. I have since deleted and uninstalled this application and will never use Travelocity again in my life. What a joke.",
      "Booked hotel for 3 days, due to weather, needed to cancel one night, but app only allowed total cancellation, could not contact Travelocity by phone to cancel just 1 day due to \"technical difficulties\" on their end. Contacted hotel to cancel 1 day, but hotel said they would do it but couldn't due to it being booked through Travelocity. After trying for 3 hrs to contact representative had to cancel through app costing me $200.00. I missed cancellation mark by one hour. Thx Travelocity for nothing",
      "Would NOT recommend using this company! When I went to book one hotel room, the site told me that it had timed out and not went through, so naturally I did it again. I ended up being charged for 2 rooms and have been trying for days to get ahold of them to get refunded , with no luck yet. The phone lines always say \"we are having technical difficulties, please call again later\", no response from FB messenger, or email either. I just want my money back from my unused hotel room.."

I cannot even see the hotels list before placing a booked date. I cannot even post a review on hotels that I have stayed so far. You have so many many bad hotels that I need to share directly with you, but I cannot post any complain nor review with your apps. Again, don't ask me to email you!",

      "5 stars all the way. This game is incredible. It is super addicting. I play it all the time. Purchases are all optional-- this is not a pay to win game as many reviews say. The graphics are incredible! Sometimes you can see glitches in the animals when they're moving, but it's not often. The enclosures are creative and fairly easy to level up. The food and treats are pretty expensive, but you can get lots of coins for hosting animals. All in all, this is an awesome game!! New favorite!",
      "I love this game so so much it is really nice, there is a bunch of diffrent animals to take care of level's are easy but so much fun to play. It's a nice and simple game because i'm not a person who is into complacated games or apps. I've had this game for 2 years on my phone and i still love it! The best part is there are not alot of ads at all and that's really nice! Also it is very giving there is food and treats around the farm which is nice, and everything is FREE! I love it so much!",
      "It's a really fun game but there's alot of adds and i really wanted to unlock the cat pen but it was alot of coins and i couldn't get that many between feeding costs and treat costs.(the treats are sooo expsensive they cost more than the food!) but the wheel and free snacks/food help but it would be better if they gave you more food for the animals you've unlocked intsead of the alot of food for the ones that you haven't unlocked. Also, up -grading the animal pens cost alot. It's fun though!!!!!",
      "Tivola is probably the best creators to make animal games and games ect. And I have most of their games, the graphics are ALWAYS amazing, it's pretty realistic, and sometimes I know there can be glitches, but it's not often at all!! Tivola, I'm sorry for all the hate you've been getting..But I support you!! And I totally recommend this app if you love animals!!",
      "I remember I got this game 3 or so years ago and let me tell you something, it was SOOOO boring. You could only take care of dogs and cats. I got this game after so long, and when I saw the features, I was in awe. That was literally the craziest thing I've ever seen in a game! I'm so happy that their is a wide variety of things to do unlike the old version. Thank you so much for making my day!"

      "I had the worst experience with this app they made a fool out of me, I for the first time booked a hotel, made the payment also, then they reassigned me to some other place, so I cancelled it. Then made another booking which when I reached the property was not at all the same as the pictures suggested , the time were stinky and very cramped. So I had to leave the place. But it shows that I checked in and also checked out. Plus they never refunded my money. Never ever oyo again. Not reliable.",
      "Useless app. Do not expect any refund despite their assurances that the refund will be credited in 2 weeks. My booking id is fbms3482 and case id are 22644557 & 23238622 dt 16.11.19. You want time to check your own computerised records. All details are given in this post. More than 10 weeks and stll no refund. .Mr sandeep kumar of oyo on 17/02/20 assured that refund will be creditef in 3 days, but stll no refund. Now what ? Where is the refund",
      "This app sucks. It doesn't show hotels in the exact place we search instead shows hotels miles and miles away. Gps search is not functioning properly. The rooms shown are far away from the search location. Very very worst app ever. Fed up of this app. I feel its better to book rooms in person. I would never suggest this app to anyone. Literally disappointing and annoying.",
      "The 1 star rating is for the lousy app, not OYO, which has some great deals. But the app is bad. Can't book with it at all because instead of showing us the booking home screen right away, it insists on showing \"looking for deals\" with a spinning wheel that goes on forever. If you have a slow connection, forget it. That spinning wheel page will never go away and you can't do anything with it because it is forced on you. So I still use agoda even when booking oyo properties.",
      "Hi, my booking id is DFVT6193.I haven't received gst invoice against the same despite several messages to your team.Also, only booking receipt is provided by your team, which doesn't mention that it is electronically generated and doesn't require any signature. Update : No resolution provided on booking id DFVT6193.Same is the case with booking id XBFP8270"

I used to have that game in my old phone in 2016 but since my phone but since my phone kept breaking and disconecting, my phone was restarted over and over again. But i remembered this game and started to download it. Its very fun but nothing changed since in the past and now and the animations are the same as the cats behavior.",
      "I think catHotel is a great game because of all the stuff to do and it's so much fun there's 4 things you can do for every cat and then when they get tired you have to put them to bed and give the cat back so they can go back the next day you start off with one cat and you can get more along the way and it's all at once I love the game and I hope you to oops there is one thing I forgot you can get different areas in your game get new levels and money and get cat hotel now I am truth it is amazin",
      "Love the art style and animation! This is a really cute game and I'm not deleting it anytime soon. The games are really fun and cool and this is overall a super nice game :3 Now, for the flaws :( Wish there was more to do, can only take care of one cat at a time, and a tiny bit glitchy. But I still love this game a lot! 👌👌❤️❤️❤️🐱🐱🐱🐈🐈🐈🐯🐯🐯🐅🐅🐅🐆🐆🐆:3:3:3",
      "It's simple yet quite realistic in showing the cats behaviour.. I love it! Especially because it's unrelated to real time making it perfect for someone who doesn't have much time to play like me! If you love cats that's definitely your game!",
      "This game is amazing! I love all of the cute cats and taking care of them. Plus, getting to decorate everything majes it even better!"

      "More than the app the problem is their costumer service. 5 mails sent, 5 times they replied without spending one second to understand my needs, and without solving my problem. In other words, if you book with them, forget the chance to indicate your frequent flyer number, as in my case, and for 4 different flights, it was not possible. Never again.",
      "The APP is not real time and definitely useless . I purchased ticket on february for a march 25 flt. I supposed to be asking for rebooking or refund because of flt cancellations due to covid, however my flt is not even listed in the app. My hard earned money will be wasted! I also emailed several times but an automatic reply has been sent with a useless message. Not useful at all!",
      "This app is soo hard to cancel and the design is confusing. And because of the design, I was able to purchase additional baggage to my return flight instead of from origin flight. I tried to cancel it right away, just 2 minutes but there was no support, no customer support at all. And they still purchase it without minding the customers side. It would be better to purchase your flight right away to flight companies than making use of their useless service. Their service is only for making money",
      "SCAM! Very deceptive and trashy app. It will change the price right as you're getting ready to pay. I checked actual airline site as well as others (couldnt use them because of my foreign credit card) mulptle times and the price hadnt change. The only amount that changed was the fees which began at 10 dollars and jumped up to 30. Pathetic they would stoop so low. That kind of trash should be criminal. Especially during a crisis!",
      "I booked my ticket in this app but i cannot find my booking number in the airline official website. Now i cannot requesta refund for my cancelled flight. This company is only after your money."

      "Spam spam spam. I have never seen an app that feels the need to spam both your sms, push and email notifications by default for opportunities for bookings. This is plain marketing manipulation. Be better guys. Manufacturers are trying to get people to look at their phones less and now you're pulling them in with every single means possible. Do better!",
      "The app is okay I guess, but customer service is horrible. I called in understanding I would have to stay on hold to talk to a representative but after not recieving any wait times and completing the same automated loop twice it hung up on me. This happened two times. If you are looking for a company that cares about customer service this isn't the one.",
      "I travel for work & have used ABB over the past year. Pros: ABB is global. It is THEE App to use for work travel & vacationing. It is fairly easy to use, once you learn how to navigate the program. Cons: I don't like that you cannot book multiple reservations at one time, each one a separate transaction. And that availability is not displayed in real time. Also messages don't always display right away. Consumer Advice: always use the \"Instant Book\" feature.",
      "Great app, easy to use, just with a few quirks. 1) The ratings are shown rounded to the nearest 0.5 so you often think they are more highly rated than they are (this definitely applies to your Saved lists, not sure elsewhere). 2) There isn't a way to change your payment methods unless you are about to book a place (or at least I couldn't find it). 3) When looking at a saved list alongside someone else (both using the app), we saw different prices - mine included service charge; his didnt.",
      "It's a great service really. I understand they are likely to take the blame for bad services provided by hosts which is unfair but I had one issue with the App company itself which I feel should be addressed. If you do not use the App for a long time and forget your password, the recovery and reactivation process is overkill. It's good to have tight security, but in my situation, it worked against me. How can some one abroad auenticate with their (likely) native phone? Security question, plz!"

      "This is an alright game. I have only gotten one horse so far so I wish there would be more options for horses. I also wish there were actual levels and not just days. I also wish there was more to do. There are times where the only thing I have to do is fill the food, water, and clean the \"stalls\".",

But this one, I completed 100 missions that I checked many times & spent things that I saved for months to complete 100 missions, BUT DIDN'T GET PROPER PRIZES. when I ask nicely, it said \"database said you only COMPLETE 20 MISSIONS\". Like, how do I know it's require 70 then 100 if not BCS I completed the level? And often glitches especially in Turtilliada.",
      "I am new to this game but why is it too slow when opening the app, I just download it a while ago then I tried to open it but it's been 30 mins. It is still loading. I am very upset",
      "I find the game challenging and fun all in one thus far, however it can be slow at building profits. Either way I do like the game very much 😊👌",
      "Hard to get started so slow everything expensive from the start but once get going it might be a good game if you have the patience",

      "Level 404 is impassible. The goals are reversed. Says 8 boxes, 9 bats. Problem is, there's 9 boxes, 8 bats. Once you've collected all the bats on the game board, it still says you didn't pass the level. I've completed all goals several times, but cannot pass the level because of the missing bat. Please help. I have reached out to support staff through the game, no response. Sent email to the email address listed, email was returned as undeliverable.",
      "So far so good, few minor things I'm sure will be fixed, freezing being the biggest. A recent issue with level 168 cost me two lives. The eye ball jars fall and leave a blank space where a bubble was placed and I could not pop it because no piece was there, just the bubble, and the rocket nor bomb would destroy it, even spent 200 coin to get the Steaks and it wouldn't let me use it on the bubble, had to lose and play again and the same thing happened, had to lose and play again. Still great game",
      "Never seems to fail. As soon as you buy a bundle pack . The game works for a little bit then goes into level loads but screen blacks out. Level 95 . Sorry to say the money I spent It wasn't worth it. Refund would be nice. New game I took a chance. Bad choice on my part. Sorry guys",
      "I like this movie. This game has potential to be more fun. Takes too long to earn. ? Some levels are very hard to get out of. If you buy your ways out what fun is tgat...its not honest... Whew...ive cut back on pkaying...may delete if you dont fix these items... Your loss... Thnx...cece in nc usa🦉",
      "I love Hotel Transylvania, so this game is awesome for me. However, some of the levels can be quite hard too pass. Also, I wish you didn't HAVE too buy Mavis with REAL MONEY, I would love too play as Mavis but I don't want to spend real money on a game, I don't think it's fair tbh. At the very least you should be able too unlock her as a playable character and NOT HAVE TOO BUY HER WITH REAL MONEY."

I planned a weeklong Vegas trip of things to do, places to eat, etc this way and never missed a thing. I ran out of vacation before I did options! Highly recommended",
      "This app is slowly improving. Most things you can do via the web interface, you can do with the app. However irritations such as embedded links not always opening, and the Inbox being slow to update private messages, mean that its not quite there yet.",
      "Have used this app for years. It has generally been very good. However I would suggest it would be more user friendly if a review writer was able to get into a review he has made. The reason being that some times after a report has been posted a writer picks up an error he has made. At present time it is a real drama to try and sort it out. If the writer could get into the review and edit it there and then, no dramas that would be a real plus. Just a thought. Regards Kiwi nev No action yet.",
      "This app is not very good. It tries to do a lot, but does it poorly. To search for a specific listing you're better off using Google. I tried writing a review and adding photos, and the app is painful in this regard - it just doesn't work properly. If you can, use the desktop version of the website, because it's less painful. You would after all these years that the developers might finally get it right. Sadly, this is not so.",
      "For checking out Hotel reviews it's fine. But I don't like it for booking a trip. Does not give clear per person pricing. Mostly just per night cost of a room. I want to know exactly what I am paying for. Even for rides to the Airport it says may include an extra charge. Then doesn't say how much. Think I will keep using a Travel agent. I don't want any surprise charges later."

I don't know why this is called \"hotel tycoon\" that makes the whole thing confusing because it's not like a hotel at all. Better names would have been \"idle town mall\" or \"idle town centre\", possibly even \"idle town recreation zone\". I love that this isn't a pay to get everything kind of game, GREAT job! 🤩",
      "The graphics is good it's like in real life-you could play offline but 1 thing tho is that it's not a hotel game it's a super market tycoon just like that other game but its on Apple only I guess,but now we have a game like this on android. : ) but i guess so that they didn't get a copyright......smart.",
      "Would have really enjoyed this game however 10 minutes in ads resulted in video didnt end properly. Bit of a let down to be honest. I shall be moving on to a different idle game. I may come back and try again one day.",
      "Just started the game tonight and liked it a lot...until now. At first, the video ads were fine and bonuses were great. Suddenly though, every time I try to watch an ad, it says \"Video 7 did not end properly.\" I cleared all relevant caches but that did not help. Is there a way to fix this? I am missing out on millions of dollars from the ads!!",
      "I already know I will get the same message I got on my review of your hospital app. \"We will continue to optimize our work and blah blah blah\". It's the same problem on both games, the ads just stop working. Please find the money to pay the service that provides you ads so that the people who download your games can enjoy their experience. You should have worked out all these problems before making it available."
