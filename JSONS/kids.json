      "A convenient selection of reasonable content. My one complaint is that it isn't fully parent-customizable. It would be nice if I could add specific YouTube videos (e.g. David Attenborough's Tree of Life) to my child's profile and have it available for them in YouTube Kids.",
      "It is really nice for her to enjoying watching her shows and she also says it's interesting and entertaining and some videos you can learn about ABC and 123and it helps other kidsnshe shows her friends at the park and says it is really nice to watch and learn new things so we really like YouTube Kids and I think other people will to this app is so exciting for kids all over the world and whenever she is supposed to go to bed she upset because she likes YouTube Kids a lot she watches it everyday",
      "Thanks! Very useful! It helped me prevent my kids from watching those Anime girls thing, I was very disappointed to acknowledge that my son is watching such inappropriate Anime cartoon at his 6 years old, but now he's unable to watch it anymore, he kinda rant about it but I don't care, I just give my son what's best, thank you once more",
      "Cannot get past the setup, I can enter my age,then the next step is to confirm my account, I receive the email saying I need to accept the terms in app, but there is no text showing up in the app. Does tha lt on my phone and my wifes phone, samsung and LG. 0 stars, bad application unusable.",
      "Very nice and useful app. I am now satisfied after installing this kid version to avoid actual version for my kid. Necessary stuff can be selected as per age factor..very nice work"

I also like the app for my girls, they can play games and learn with their favorite charcters from their favorite PBS Kids shows. Please fix this and any other problems for all the kiddos out there that want to learn and play fun games with there fav. charcters too 😁💜",
      "DISSAPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING!! My son loves PBS. When I think PBS, I think dedication to education and learning and I think Quality. This app falls way short. Crashes, freezes, wont work, too many bugs and inconsistencies with accessing the App. NO !! It's not our devices! This is per other reviews, from personal experience and across multiple and different devices. I know it's free but this is ridiculous. Please get it together. This is a huge disservice to children at this point.",
      "First the game was really fun but after a little bit is stopped working because something happened something happened and it doesn't work when I try to load into the app but in all when you get into the app it's very fun the games are awesome. And everything is so much fun and in all I read this app 3 stars.",
      "OK So This Seems To Work A Bit, But 1 Question, Why Did You Remove The Electric Company From PBS And It's Party Game Lost On Prankster Planet On The App Store? Please Bring The Electric Company Games Back :( And Respond To This Please PBS, If You Respond, I'll Give You 4 Stars, If You Bring The Electric Company Back, I'll Give You 5 Stars And I'm Not Lying I Really Will Give 5 Stars If You Bring It Back :)",
      "There is now sound after a month and a half of no response from dev team. Games crash often, but my four year old loves it. EDIT: the sound goes out daily and i have to reinstall."

      "I personally really enjoy that this game doesn't have a color switch option- instead it changes with every stroke in the order of the rainbow. It's a great app for toddlers or smaller kids who aren't smart enough yet to change the color alone. It's got an easy interface and yet a lot of options. My 2 and 3 year old neices love it. Great app and I strongly recommend!",
      "My kids like it. It's a nice little distraction for doctor appointments or long waits places. They can be creative and it's easy enough my 2 year old can swap out one drawing type for another and switch to a blank pad. Recommended for parents that need a distraction for kids that like to make colorful designs.",
      "Good doodle app for kids. But the constant ads is a complete and utter joke!! Running an ad-blocker for this app is a MUST! Running ads at the main screen is fine.. Understandable even! But on the drawing page? That's rediculous! Use an ad-blocker or find an alternative! Or at least give the option to unlock an ad-free version with a one-time purchase",
      "Its okay. It gives you an oppertunity to color and draw on your own photos. Its fun. I use it to draw funny things. I loose intrest in it a little quickly.",
      "It's nice to do when your bored or just need to satisfy yourself. The colors are so beautiful, and it's not a waste of time. There are ZERO ads and its great for kids."

So good to not have to work about the content my son could come across. Very well designed to!",

      "This app has not let me or my toddler down. It has always been reliable with the latest episodes even before they air on Mondays. The app has helped us on long car trips and she absolutely loves to see her Elmo, Cat and discover new shows like odd squad and Xavier riddle.",
      "My favorite kids video app ever! Even as a grown up I enjoy the videos when I watch with my kids. Everything is age appropriate and fun. Productions are super high quality they are all well thought and produced.",
      "Love PBS, grew up with it and i'm amazed with all the shows that are still going that my son can now enjoy. Unfortunately shows like Fetch (not the Ruff Ruffman Show) and Peep aren't on the app and the ones that my son watches like Cyberchase and Wild Kratts only have a few full episodes on it."

      "Seems like a cute game, but they embed ads for the full version into the play so that kids can't click those balloons and just get told to buy the full version. That's super crappy. I might have otherwise bought this, but not with that kind of approach.",
      "I love the app, but i wish it had a setting that made it more difficult to back out of. My granddaughter loves to play it but she's constantly hitting the \"back\" button & then the game stops, she cries, i have to put it back on, 10 seconds later she does it again. I bought the full version hoping that would change things but sadly, no.",
      "My two year old loves this a lot, and having multiple languages available from the main menu is super useful for kids being raised bilingually! We can stop her exiting the game accidentally by using Android's App Pinning feature, but she does get into the settings screen a lot in spite of the calculator lock. Maybe making the lock answer two digits might help with this? Finally there is a single bug we've found - if the phone gets locked while the game is running, the music stops once you unlock it again and you have to restart the game (but not the app) to get it back.",
      "I downloaded the game for something my Girlfriend's Son could play on my phone that would hopefully be educational. Within about 10 minutes he was repeating colors and within about 20 minutes he was saying the colors as he popped the balloons. We have been playing for a couple weeks now and its very significant how much it has helped him learn and be consistent.",
      "The way the screen locks in game mode is great. My lil one can't back out. She can tap, push all she wants. She's already repeating colors as the game says (3 yrs old)"

      "I just recently actually; started using messenger kids to keep in contact with my 2 little boys! It's definitely the best thing, by far, that Facebook has came out with for children! & well I guess mainly the parents.. an other family too! 🙃 it's so easy and simple!! My 9 year old and my 6 year old have a blast on it!.. especially...with all the different, silly filters & games we get to play around with while we're talking to each other! 🙃🙃",
      "This app allows younger kids talk to there friends and their parents. It allows lost of different stuff. U could play a drawing game and send ur picture to a friend and have them guess what it is. There isn't just filters but there is little games you can play with you and who ever you are talking to on call. It's kind of like a discord to because u can close the app and go into another app while u are still on call. THIS APP IS WONDERFUL",
      "SO AMAZING! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHAT WITH PEOPLE JUST BY ENTERING A CODE! Just enter a code and boom! You can now chat with another person! It's that easy! There is some ads but they never occur when you are chatting or typing! You can even see when someone sent a message just by CLICKING THE MESSAGE!!!!I rated this five stars for a reason! DOWNLOAD NOW!!!",
      "I love this app. I can message and face time all of my friends that have the app. I can also send pictures and videos. My only criticism is that I can't send gifs anymore even though my friend can. My mom didn't put any restrictions and I used to be able to. We didn't change anything so it makes no sense why I can no longer send gifs.",
      "We love this app. We can completely control who our son can talk to and set times when calls can't be made or come through. We didn't want to get our son a cell phone but wanted him to let us know when he got home from school. He gets home facetimes my wife our I and it's great."

      "Too many ads! Its a game for little kids and they put adult ads at the top of the screen the whole time the game is running. The ads take your child on the internet and then who knows what the end up seeing and what all site's they could encounter.",
      "Really disappointed in what this game has become with all the ads. My 5 year old is constantly having to get help to get out of the ads. We're deleting the game to look for something less intrusive.",
      "Mmmm not sure if you have any questions or concerns please visit the plug-in settings you are the best YouTuber ever known me for the time to go and get back to you and your family and friends right now because this video is not available for remote playback 4",
      "Looove this game. It's perfect for little kids. To get rid of ads its 99 cents and if you want all the trucks unlocked right away, you can pay a small fee and unlock all the cars but it's worth it. It's simple for them to use and, there are mini games that my son loves as well. Wish all kids games were this simple and cheap.",
      "My little brother is obsessed with this game. The game is very fun, lots of activities. But my little brothers favorite part is unlocking new cars. But there is one thing that the game should be updated to have MORE cars to unlock and it should tell us if we got 1st, 2nd or 3rd then the balloon pop. I hope this helps you to find out if you should get the game or not."

I thought Peppa Pig didn't discriminate between rich and poor kids, but it definitely does! The toys are already expensive, why make this app so expensive? It really doesn't make sense. Also, spring has begun, when will it be spring in Peppa Pig world ? I would love to see a spring version!",

Theres only 2 dinos everything else is locked so deleting. *To response: You can give gifts, feed the dinos, tickle them, do a puzzle, get facts, maybe there's supposed to be 8 but they didn't work for us & there's only so many times you can do the same thing. It's nice you created this, others seem to enjoy it but my 3 yr old has older siblings & asked to delete it & chose something else. No point arguing, we rated based on our experience compared to other games*",

      "The touch Doesnt really work. Have to tap too many times to get things to happen",
      "My 2 year old loves this and the other one (bought both) but the balloons that spell the dinosaurs names are extremely unresponsive. My son taps them a ton but they only pop if you touch them in a really specific place. Otherwise the app is nice for dinosaur loving little ones but the balloon thing needs fixing because my son is too young to understand why they don't pop 95% of the time when he taps them."

      "This game is very boring but however I enjoyed this game. When we start building the house so I feel we are building a real home. This game should have more levels to be built. Due to this only I start feeling boring by making the same houses. There are four houses from which two of them are blocked. However the game is good but it need some changes like it should have more houses 🏠🏠🏠🏠. It should have several levels for making a house. The vehicles should be controlled by us only.",
      "I have play pass and I'm still getting ads with pop ups requesting money to make them go away. Please fix. *Update to GoKids! response* You can't make it fully free? I don't understand. I pay a subscription for play pass. Your app description clearly shows that \"No ads or in-app purchases with your play pass subscription\". Either there is a miscommunication or error somewhere.",
      "My kid enjoyed this game. I've bought the game on the two devices. But, since 3 weeks ago, all the SOUND stopped working on all devices. So, game itself is working, but there is no sound. Is it the compatibility problem with some android update? I think that happened when you added new stuff to the game. As I said, I've bought the game on two devices, and I'll give you 5 star rating if you fix the problem with sound. My devices are not a problem. I have Note 9 i Note 10.",
      "My 3 yr old loves this game but it keeps freezing up. I must turn my cell phone off and on to unfreeze it. Any suggestions? 1/25/2020 I reinstalled the game. It appears to be ok. I want to purchase more levels but dont understand your categories of tester, developer, etc. What is the difference between the 3 categories? 1/27/20 Still need to know what the difference is between the 3 price options.",
      "My 2 year old loves how his favorite things in the world, trucks, come to life in this interactive game. He was at first frustrated with the controls, but after practicing a few times, he even learned how to navigate the \"commercials.\" Aside from the obvious benefits, the greatest has been the emotional and mental growth. Thanks & kudos to everyone who made this possible!"

      "my daughter is 2 years old and i found this app very helpful since she already knows her abc and numbers this app helped her in learning her colors and shapes and she got to meet lucas and ruby. she really enjoys the game that we have to switch phones because the app was installed in my phone. now im using her phone 🤣 great app and easy to navigate. she really enjoyed this",
      "I cannot thank you enough for these apps of yours. I have downloaded pretty much all but a couple math ones (because my daughter is only 2), but I will download them soon! They're absolutely INCREDIBLE. I tell ALL of my friends about them! My daughter adores the characters and loves when we let her play her games! She blows us away by how quickly she picks things up and it helps us to put emphasis on shapes, colors, numbers, etc. I just want to say Thank You for all you're doing! :)",
      "Before there was the update changing the animals, this game was great. Since the update, the game will not load past the first screen. It freezes at 100%. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, and nothing works. I wish it worked because it was fantastic for our oldest child. Edit: after clearing the cache and the data, I was able to get the game to work. This game is wonderful for helping to teach shapes and colors with multiple activities and repetition. So glad to have it working!",
      "I love the fact that this app is interactive and entertaining. We are in the beginning stages of teaching or toddler letter sounds, numbers, colors, as well shapes. I downloaded the ABC Kids and the 123 Numbers from this same company. I am impressed with the quality of the app and grateful that it is free.",
      "Every time my son saw the game logo he will automatically smile and run towards me to get my phone, and his day also brighten up whenever he see either Lucas or Ruby. Currently he likes to play the color section. (Since he is only one y/o) I do recommend this app for kids at the age of one. The best one in store and it is absolutely free! Thank you for this app guys!"

I let my daughter play games on the phone so I can do housework and she's not disturbing me but with this game (mind you without the adds) would be the greatest app) but because I'm getting disturbed every second I hate it",

      "This app is ok. Its great for exploring but not much learning. Theres alot of fun sounds and songs but there is no instruction. For example. There is a pattern sheet. And im not sure what to do. Do we draw the picture? And if so how is my 4 year old supposed to draw a sail boat. There should be options to look through pictures and put them in the correct spot. And i would like it in the alphabet page if it said the letter alloud other than just play music. Deleting for now. Hope it gets fixed.",

Here's the kicker, in-app purchases won't work with your Google family library, folks. That purchase is tied to your account only. Want to let kiddo play on your spouse's device? Too bad. I wouldn't mind so much having a free version and a paid app, but misleading with a \"free\" app that only works through in-app purchase is despicable.",

      "The full unlock (swipe to the left not right) is considerably cheaper than the cost of unlocking each theme individually. * The lockable themes have EXACTLY the same activities. They only look different. * My 4 year old became bored quickly. Interest doesn't persist beyond a few play throughs. This app may look fine by it is not worth the cost. Unfortunate. If the complete version was available for perhaps $3 - $4 I might consider the purchase.",
      "The app itself is good and my daughter enjoyed it enough for me to pay for the full version. However, the app reverted back to locked status for an unknown reason. The restore purchases option does nothing and the padlock icon takes me to the Google payment page as though I'd never bought it. After a few emails, Bimi Boo have provided a work around but the root issue remains unknown. At least my daughter should be able to use the app again for now. Thank you."

      "Terrible, there is a commercial after every game my son plays! The commercial is for a kid way older. Just trying to teach my kid numbers and letters. Also have to buy everything its just awful. Since my review the comercials and adds have gotten worse, it happens after every game. These people dont get it. Its a childrens game and the adds are for children much older. Also they said you can skip then ya ok, once you try to skip them it jumps to another add or exits you out of the game.",
      "This is a very intresting game. I play this game at first time but this game is very intresting. this game to my friends. My favourite cartoon is masha and the bear and my brother like this cartoon most. I am very sad because I have not a masha and the bear doll. You give me a masha and the bear doll please answer yes or no. If yes you answer and I send my addresses to parcel doll ok.",
      "My daughter and I can't figure out why we can't play any of the games. I am not going to pay for anything until we can figure it out and even I can't get it to work. I will try and uninstall and reinstall. Nothing seems to work. We click on a game and then it seems to just freeze. We can go back to main screen and that's all",
      "It is a very weird game for my daughter an it needs a update u need to make it funner and boring because e my daughter does not like it and have paid 100$to get a new specifically for this game and it does not work true fact hope this helped 🙏 pray fo poor Masha and the bear also the picture game is slow and stuip need to add action learning fes hope this helped u because everything type was true fact so don not ask how this get is anymore",
      "I received a reply from the company and they've basically told me that I need to pay MORE for the game when I had ALREADY paid for everything; the unlimited candies, the three outfits and no ads. The subscription service should not apply to people who bought the game prior to the update. THIS IS A RIP-OFF!!! The company CLEARLY care more about money than its customers."

      "What a scam. Payment method expired so after a couple months decided to cancel the subscription. Cancelled they a few days later updated payment methods for other apps. They then decided to reinstate my subscription for Noggin without permission. I'll never use this again.",
      "The recent update has changed the entire layout. Its much more confusing now with games mixed in with the episodes. The names of episodes no longer show either. When you're done watching/playing be sure to close out of the app completely or the show moght start up/continue on its own several minutes later. This is especially creepy in the evening. I'm hoping for an update/fix soon otherwise we'll be cancelling our subscription.",
      "I have this for my four year old. he played the games and watches shows. we have it on a tablet and two TVs. never a problem. $8 a month is cheaper than cable.",
      "If I could give less than the 1 star I would. The app is very misleading. It keeps saying it can't connect to my internet on all of my devices. I thought it was just the one but then it's all of them. Not worth continuing a subscription. My son couldn't get into anything the 2 days we were allowed to get into the app. I know it's not my internet. I'm switching to a different learning app."

      "Just, no. Absolutely no. Upon starting the app, it looks pretty nice. Things are sorted in categories and multiple activities are available. However, ads are really prevalent and make it easy for kids to two-click install mystery apps. The alphabet game teaches with a horrible midi voice, and always seems to skip the correct next letter. In conclusion, this doesn't even work as advertised and it isn't safe from kids pressing what they shouldn't.",

      "I don't usually write reviews but I feel it is important to say that this and the boats game, and possibly others are very similar in concept, animation and play style to another popular kids game (see my boats review.) I'm unsure who copied who but the differences are purely cosmetic. I've had issues with this and the boats game regularly, once new content releases it asks you to pay more money to unlock \"all\" content. Feels scammy although the game itself is very cute and engaging.",
      "This is really a funny game! My children really enjoy playing with it. Sounds and pictures are funny and they laugh with raccoon's while he is racing and capturing stars. They love the chance of changing colors and each one choose his favourite color, tires and stickers. Even the older one, who is not a toddler, enjoys designing the cars and running. For us, it's really a 5 stars!!!",
      "This game allows child to create their own car and place it in a race. Good game for 3+ years old and especially if they like cars.",

But the 3 shapes to select after the drawing comes to life to move or make the object do b something, I can't tell that they cause any different reaction and seem to not have much function.",

      "My son loved it, I decided to buy the full version BUT quickly changed my decision when I found out how much it was. 5 dollars for this game is an unreasonable price for what it is, especially since there are so many other fun apps for kids out there that are cheaper or even free, I would've bought it if was in the 1-2 dollar price range, which was what I was expecting, really shocked that it was more. Heck you can buy a game like minecraft for 5 dollars, why is a coloring app that expensive????",

      "Great game. More than happy to pay the small amount required to unlock all trucks and levels. One small criticism: the jump and horn buttons are somewhat awkwardly placed, but this does not detract from the overall quality and presentation. Perfect game for the smaller Monster Truck fan! 10 out of 10",
      "this game is so good day I love this game very because this game has different monster truck and I love to crush the car in this game",
      "Good game but no way to turn the music off.",
      "Great Game My Son Loves to Play! Perfect for Pre Schoolers. Simple an Fun! ☺",
      "horrible game it gave my phone a virus. If i had the option for no star that is what I would give you."

      "Great game for kids, can be a little difficult for kids to control when but will learn in time. My nephew likes to unlock all of the planes quickly and it says you can watch an ad to double stars. I watched an add and he didnt get any extra stars at all so disappointed with that.",
      "This is absolutely adorable. I,a 37 yo, even experienced entertainment from trying it out for the lo's. There is an ever present ad atop game play but doesnt get in the way. Start out with 3 plane model options. Levels unlock as u continue to play. There are 4 or 5 other minigames to choose from. I think my 6 and 3yo will love this . TY",
      "Great toddler game my 2 year old loves it! Easy to play plane game. Only problem is sometimes he flys to high over the finish line pole and his game doesn't end just keep going & going with no end in sight or anything to collect & lost everything bought when I got a new phone",

      "I LOVE this app! My little sister loves the stories and how she gets money everyday for reading! She loves to buy the new books and set goals for herself to get to 2000. I honestly love this app, not only does it teach reading it also teaches morals, helps to raise goals for young ones, and it also has cool games for young kids. I truly love this app. You should buy it!👌",
      "This app is really awesome, I did not expect it to be so nice. I downloaded it for my daughter and when we started reading we saw that you can interact with the book!! Soo amazing. There is tasks to do to finish reading the book and also fun mini games to play to continue reading.",
      "I like how it held our interest. It is very pleasant and clever. I tutor children whose first language is not English. Since we are in the USA, it is fun to hear the words pronounced with a British accent. It is sometimes difficult, however, to understand the speech when we touch the objects on the pop-up pages . I wish closed captioning were an option. Thank you for creating such an enjoyable way to read these classic fairy tales!",
      "This app is awesome, the music, narrator's voices, graphics, interactive scenes, everything is so great. I wanted suggest few things. first, kindly, if possible, make it highlight the words that the narrator is narrating, secondly, some pages are fully written, and kid needs to concentrate. therefore I think it will be better if there is a stop option, to stop narration while the kid gets reoriented. thirdly, lengthier stories should be added for a bit young kids. like Alladin etc.",
      "My girls age 2 and 3 now like the books to be read to them but dont know when to turn the page, would be nice if there was a little chime at the end so they know when to turn. Also they cant read so when it comes to the interactive part it would be nice if there was a voice to tell them what to click instead of having to read it."

      "The app said it come with games and what not. There are no games. I have to download more. It should also come with more free songs also everything costs money now a days. Its for freaking babies. The damn songs should be free.",
      "I love this app, I actually downloaded it for my baby brother... And now he can actually sing some of the songs in it, he also knows some of his colours and numbers to.. so I would recomend this app alot.",
      "Open with popups to buy more, then when you close those, it goes to the store to buy more. Then you have to navigate to another screen to actually get to your purchased music. Not great for young kids to navigate to play songs. Also anytime we have switched devices we cannot restore purchases and lose all of the money we spent buying songs. Some of the songs are also extremely annoying. Poor app. Poor songs. Easy to lose money on app purchases that won't work.",
      "Outrageous, I down loaded this app for my friend (only just started nursery) who loves pinkfong songs but when I had a look at the songs there all nursery rhymes not one pinkfong song. Even more if you want to add more songs on you have to pay for them. And if your child wants that song but you don't want to pay think how sad he\\shes going to be. I'm definitely not telling my friend about this app. UNINSTALLED straight away",
      "We've bought quite a few packs from here, but I hate how so many of the packs have the same songs c so if you buy it in one pack you're basically wasting money buying it with a different pack. If they would change the home screen to the songs you actually have purchased and makes the songs available for individual purchase instead of packs that all contain the same songs, I'd give it 5 stars."

I'm response to response from developer, what you say may be worth considering and I saw the 3 day trial, however I had to select a subscription plan for my user on each device before I could get a trial, and there was no mention about any types of a count being free or any family plans. I even sent to your website. Please send a link to informatio",

Samsung galaxy s7 active tried uninstalling and reinstalling still doesn't work",
      "Want to reiterate an earlier review that I'm sure was one of many inre this issue, the full-screen ads that pop up every 1-2 minutes which I have to clear off so my kid can play the game are BULL****! As soon as I get him weaned off these games this will be a quick uninstall. Also, FYI, the companies that are marketed in these ads are GUARANTEED TO NEVER GET MY BUSINESS.",
      "I put this on my phone a few months ago and at first my 3yr didnt want any part of it as he liked watching youtube videos. So I started turnining off the internet so if he wanted to play with my phone he only had learning games and out of 4 games I had he loves this one. He has gottsn so good at the activites and actually plays the game more than he watches youtube now. Fun and educational!",

My only negative about this game is that the apple version of this game always seems to have better cars like space, halloween and xmas then the android version. It is why my daughter prefers playing this game on the apple tablet instead of android, despite the fact it crashes often on apple compared to the android version.",

      "2 & 4 year old TWIN grandsons LOVE love this game!! They love feeding the animals and watching the chickens go scurrying after the food. They love to feed the pigs, when the poor last little piggy sadly turns and begins to walk away they yell out Nooooo little piggy come back there is more food for you!! They love feeding all the other animals. Strangely, this silly fun game I think believe teachers them love and compassion and in a small way, service!! Great job guys!😁"

Will update review if I see an update that fixes any of the items I mentioned.",
      "My daughter loves it. And it works well on her tablet.",
      "I thought it was going to be a cool game for my daughter and I downloaded it and all was fun until she wanted to switch instruments I think it is absolutely ridiculous that you have to pay for more interments and songs and animals!!! Hey come and download this free game.. but bam you have to spend money to get all the other cool stuff!!! If it is free it should be free. And if it ain't free you should put it on there saying this app is free to download but if you want all the cool stuff that comes with it you have to pay money. So I don't waste my time... hey parents you want a free game just like this one then it's called kids piano-Music and songs now it is free with all the cool stuff!!",
      "My 2 year old son really loved the other version. We like the new version too especially the piano. I do prefer the new version, because now he has to work to fill in the images and make an effort to finish. He got bored otherwise as he didn't have to put in an effort to finish it. I didn't mind paying for the full version, it has nice graphics and it's fun for him.",
      "bit disappointed that after paying for many of these apps, there still appears an add for new apps. my daughter keeps accidentally pressing the button. i don't think it's right to continue with adds once paid money for an app.otherwise the games are well thought out and my daughter and i enjoy playing them together. i have since had response from developer and am putting up my star rating as a result."

      "Excessive pop ups but good game. Play again- pop up. Change activity-1 pop up, 1 dev advertisement. Pick a game, some need to be downloaded. Not sure if that means you have to buy more or just download but looks like baby can do it. Haven't tried honestly. It's something i might consider purchasing for my grand daughter but seriously can't stand the pop ups. I understand pop ups are part of free packages, however, the amount of pop ups is excessive, as stated previously.",
      "Ridiculous amount of ads. I understand that ads pay for development, but this is a game for toddlers. After every game you are forced to watch a full 30 second commercial. I had at least 5 Candy Crush Saga ads, with no option to get out after 10 seconds. Full ads. You people are kidding yourself and you will end up sabotaging your own industry. People are not fools.",
      "This is kind of bogus. I paid $4.99 for this game to get rid of the ads, and there are still tons of links to other games for download that are not included, which are basically ads for other games. For that much money for an app I shouldn't still have to direct my kid to avoid an entire row of games because they're for different apps that cost additional money. Update based on response: Give the option of removing links to additional paid content. Otherwise it's just a money grab.",
      "Exciting from the start and it got my 2 years old daughter's attention immediately, had I not lost my job, I would be happy to support this program by purchasing whatever the app has to offer, Thanks for making it possible to use the app for free, I really do appreciate it",
      "I boughy the next levels but now when games are played it stays at the same level never goes up a level and that after I paid R39,99. nice games for little one just sad that it gives you a option to buy next levels but does not give it in return"

Despite being purchased through my play store account (via my phone) the purchase does not transfer to a tablet with the same account. I emailed the company through the email they provided in comments to other unhappy customers and still have no heard back week later.",
      "already bought in app, but after changing the cellphone with the same Gmail account, there are still ads and can't remove ads. edit : I have sent an email since January 1, but there was no response. so here's how the developer takes income from the buyer.",
      "DO NOT PURCHASE NO ADS IN THIS APP!I purchased no ads and it won't allow me to use on my second device without a second purchase to remove ads with this being a childs app it should allow use with gmail on re-download for multiple device use, HORRIBLY UNREASONABLE !",
      "Downloaded this app on both of my sons tablets. One tablet had to be factory reset to fix a glitch. Now I can't restore the purchase on the tablet. Which is disappointing cause my sons loves this app and the dino section is has. I have sent an email to the developer but have not back yet",
      "Ads ruin the experience. I'm not sure why a toddlers app would be bombarded with ads, especially the banner at the bottom. Deceptive way to get clicks - by having a 2 year old accidentally download other apps. Uninstalling"

So, i don't want to spend my money on this useless app. Please, fix this problem.",
      "Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too.",

I have only been able to get on the app 1/6 tries as it keeps giving me the blue loading screen. It does this on my android phone and tablet. I have had to go through the web on my phone which then offers me the app...frustrating. I was able to use it through the web on her tablet but would like the app better as it is easier.",
      "I has the same problem as Ella Shaefer (sorry if I misspelled the last name). I used the app without incident for months, maybe years, and then suddenly couldn't access even though I was charged. ***Customer support was slow and unhelpful. Even after I gave my card info, screenshot of charges, etc they said I had an active account but probably with a different login, I've used the same login this whole time.**The problem has resolved itself now, after being unable to access the app for weeks.",
      "Got the app. Went to make a profile name. Did that. Then it asks for my kids age and it won't even let me click his age. So I try all the ages and it won't let me click any of them. I thought my tablet had froze up or something, so I try clicking the next button. Low and behold! it says \"CLICK AN AGE TO CONTINUE!!!\" Do not waste your time on downloading this app!"

      "I purchased this app for my daughter. February a 2019 it is never works correctly. Every time we get on it only allows us to watch the free videos says that we don't have a subscription and that we need a new one. We have a subscription. In fact, I was just charged again for a subscription that I cannot use when I tried to cancel it. It says it won't cancel till next year. I'm very disappointed with baby first and with Google Play.",
      "BabyFirst puts BabyFirst FIRST! I haven't used the app yet however I've read review after review of mainly subscribed users & difficulty accessing subscription content after purchase. Yet, BabyFirst replies w/basically the same reply every time. Obviously it's an APP ISSUE, NOT a per user, case by case basis. It's easy to get money back. With my bank, when I pay for services I don't receive or not as described, I report to Google & dispute with my bank along with documentation to back it up.",
      "This app is garbage. We set up the free trial and planned to do the yearly subscription, but can't access any content. The app just goes in circles telling us to restore subscription, then asks us to pick a plan when I can see from my email that I have one. We're getting rid of our cable and had planned to use this for my 20 month old and 9 month old and now we can't.",
      "I guess it's ok. I just got it for my baby who loves Babyfirst TV but his favorite show seems to be Shushybye...and I do not see Shushybye on the app at all. I was hoping I could let him watch it while I took a shower. I tried the lullaby videos but he didn't seem to like them. Can you please put Shushybye on the app?",
      "You may technical support once you purchase it, or to clear the app data after your purchase. A side from some initial problems the technical support cleared up, the app is pretty good. My kid loves some of the show and it's worth the subscription fees for no commercials."

      "Best app I found so far for my boy, no ads and no in app purchases. I'd give it a 5 if they had free draw on here, my kid sometimes just like to scribble a whole bunch of colors in the pictures and the app wont let you draw anywhere outside the lines you start in. And the boarder is kind of annoying, should be a way to take that off. Other than that it's a good coloring app"
