      "It's an alright learning platform, but i feel like it's too test-based and not lesson-based enough, but guess it works for memory. Otherwise it's pretty fun. One issue i noticed recently is that you used to be able to drag and drop word boxes into different parts of a phrase, but that ability is gone all of a sudden. Could that be re-added please? It's really tedious to have to delete an entire sentence just because i missed a word earlier on.",
      "This is a great way to learn at home, the stories, podcasts, and just the app in general is amazing. I love using it and it is a fun way to learn. I love it when you Finnish a whole section, just the achievement. this is great for working on your own or I like to take it alongside my French class so that I can get even better at French and faster.",
      "This app is most definitely helpful. I enjoy the animations and the way you can click a word and get all the referencing words. I only wish that maybe there were some mini-games such as flash cards or even a word search or crossword puzzles. I also think that this apps that reach more to the basic fundamentals such as Counting and colors. Besides that, great app.",
      "Good app but.. just today I logged in and completed a lesson. I got a few questions wrong, so I decided to complete another one. But then it said I had no more \"hearts\" left. I knew that it was new because I had never seen it before. I under stand that you need money for Duolingo to happen, and this is another opportunity to make more money. But schools allow children to use Duolingo in schools and that may change if students have to pay to practice. I hope that you understand and please reply.",
      "The app works great and at first I loved it. As it gets more difficult (which it should), the loss of hearts is irritating. Hearts are essentially the number of mistakes you are allowed. If you run out of hearts, you can't do anything with the app for hours. You can get more hearts with gems, but they run out too. The only way around this is to pay for the premium edition and poof..... the \"free\" app isn't free anymore."

      "I am speechless... For the first time satisfied with an app from play store. Hats off to the creator, his creativity and the idea to create such a useful app. If you are determined to learn something new in the field of coding, it's definitely worth installing this SoloLearn. It's simply awesome and simple too... Even as a beginner I am not facing any issue or problem. The app has been designed very carefully and it has lots of great content. 👍👍👍👍👍👍",
      "Is fun and very very useful for myself if you're looking out for apps to use. To learn coding this is my best recommendation rn... Compare to other ones that I've downloaded you need to go premium in order to learn and pay for the knowledge they will give you but this one is the best..... So if your still hesitated take my word for it.. It won't let you down.....",
      "Great way to learn the basics of code, keep your coding skills sharp, or refresh you knowledge. Many coding languages are offered. The best way to learn how to code is to actually code, and this app offers you to opportunity to do to a decent degree. Perfect for when want to chill on the couch and code or learn while commuting.",
      "SO AMAZING This app is where i started, i played and messed around here. i wish i could explain exactly what happened throughout these 4 years of me having this app and how it helped me to not push me into the world of programming but lead me and guide me into it. Sololearn has the absolute best community and people who are willing to help and inspire. They have high quallity tutorials. And many languages to pick. They have coding challenges every week. Sololearn helped me to lern to code! GET!",
      "Update: look at this generic cut-and-paste response from the developer; a laughable attempt to show they are \"listening\". LMAO Decent so far, except there is no option to buy to remove ads, just subscription to pro. This app is worth a one time purchase of $5 at best, and if it was, they'd get $5 from me, but because \"software as a service\" is a trash concept, they'll get zero."

      "As a youngin I never truly understood how computers actually work, and now that I'm getting older, (early 20's) and moved from Mac to Windows, I'm finding a lot more interest in the backbone of computers. This is an awesome app and I'm glad I found it! Thanks for not asking over and over for me to pay as well, but its worth a buck or 2!",
      "I like the app, but I can't change test answers when I get them wrong, it's upsetting. I would think the long term use of keeping a test is to have another example of a correct answer. An answer being permanently wrong attached to your account is detrimental to the learning process (a real life test would have the correct answer shown after the grading. For another, it's anxiety inducing to have permanent marks because the major benefit of a free online course w/o no teacher is no pressure/GPA",
      "For complete beginners. Many hints & explanations; very easy. JavaScript without typing: select what you want to code from box of functions app has taught. Can't write better code using loops in topic one: no loop in the box to select. No way to skip things you already know. I'd rather code on a computer in a programming environment like Eclipse; its hard to click the exact spot you want to modify the code on a touchscreen. Longer code becomes unwieldy on the small screen. Not fun; too easy.",
      "The idea is wonderful but there's room for improvement. The app is easy and fun to navigate. I love the Grasshopper icon. The concept of the app is great and the feeling of accomplishment is awesome. However, after awhile you feel like you're just following directions rather than learning. I understand the idea behind following steps and keeping things simple, but at some point w need to have assignments without guidance since the concept was given prior the exercise. Constructive criticism",
      "While it might look a bit too 'elementary' at the beginning, this is to explain the concepts in the simplest terms. That being said, I feel the app does too much of the work for the user, robbing them of the chance to better cement the ideas being taught by implementing them on their own terms."

      "I am able to sign into my account on the computer, but whenever I try to loh in on mobile it says, \"Invalid Password.\" I would like Khan Academy to fix this issue right away so instead of waiting to go on the computer I can go on Khan Academy on mobile. I need to keep up with Khan Academy because COVID-19 shut down my school and I need to finish doing my work for 6th grade Math. If you don't fix this bug I would not be able to go on mobile so I woupd have to wait for my turn on the computer.Oof",
      "Love the app, I love studying , I'm a nerd like that. I'm having trouble with the videos, the sound is fine but visually it's all wrong, I can't see what's going on. I realise this is probably the fault of my phone, I just wondered if you'd heard of this issue before and would be able to help?",
      "Love the app. The content and UI is really great. Some more features could be added though, like manually selecting video quality while streaming and downloading because sometimes the quality is so low, I cannot understand the audio and video. Also, dark mode for nighttime would really help.",
      "I want to give it 5 stars for the content, idea and mission... however i can not find on the app autoplay option for videos, even worse there is no one click to go to the next video in landscape mode (like there is on youtube), which wastes a lot of energy and time, especielly while exercising (e.g. stationary bike). I will revise my review if there is an autoplay option. I am using android on samsung note phone.",
      "I really love this app it really does help me when I get stuck on a problem because all I have to do when I get stuck on a problem is get on Khan Academy thank you people who works for the company you people/guys/and girl's are the best of all."

      "This app is amazing. It explains everything so well and doesn't pile a bunch of words and stuff on you at once. It's pacing is so good and it's so helpful how it explains things. I do wish it reinforced a little more and was slightly more engaging but it's honestly so good I love it.",
      "Hey LingoDeer, I'm totally satisfied with your service of language teachings. Last time when I downloaded app, I felt it's too much boring for me. But after listening about app, reading feedbacks online, I just re-downloaded again. Well, it has been improved a lot till now. Thanks for making such an amazing app. Still it is very important and useful for everyone!😄😄😄",
      "It easy enjoyable a first, but the more I progress through the lessons, the more bugs I encounter and the more the interface feels clunky and unfinished. The \"detailed tips\" have obvious mistakes. Learning Vietnamese from English, some questions are impossible to answer without knowing how to read Chinese, as it shows 4 images with Chinese characters to choose from. Most annoying is the clicking on those tiny letters to write answers, and too many more annoyances to list here. It's a shame.",
      "JAPANESE COURSE - I started to like the app, it had some fun ways to get you immersed... but then, the problems came. First, it makes you use hiragana on the keyboard translations where you should use katakana ('American' should NOT be written in Hiragana). Second, their stories throw you into hardcore Kanji before you even have your basic hiragana down and are discouraging. Lastly, a pay wall by the second lesson preventing you from exploring enough to see if you want to upgrade. Moving on.",
      "I've used 8 different apps for learning Japanese, with 2 books. LingoDeer is the first I've wanted to purchase the full mode for. I purchased 1 full year. I am very far into duolingo, & other apps, and none have been as informative, and helpful as this one. I like that I can listen, then repeat, and hear my own voice. I've been able to correct a lot of pronunciation that way. There are extreme helpful learning tips before each lesson too! Only downside is no writing, or stroke order practice!!"

You aren't going to get much anywhere without going away from the learning more though, I recommend the one where you have to spell out the word using the dashes and dots. Well worth the minimal time and effort, thank you for giving me the privelige to have such a wonderful app.",
      "I love doing this in my freetime! One mode I feel would be great within the app is one that is just like the \"LEARN MORSE CODE\", where it just gives you the letter without it telling you to code in the beginning, or an option in the setting to disable that.",
      "Needs a learn mode where it shows the letter and plays the sound with no visual representation of the sound. Start slow like that then increase. The worst way to learn morse is by visually associating the sound with a visual representation of the sound (i.e. . - for A). Go direct from sound to visual of the LETTER!",
      "The app in itself is great. A feature I suggest adding is an area where you can freely Morse instead of having to either translate or attempt to find in the trainer.",
      "Terribly unuser friendly. I've used many apps of many kinds. This is one of the hardest to navigate. I get stuck because there's no back buttons. The phone back button has to be used twice, but isn't always available, depending on what part of what menu you're in. All the menu's are good ideas, they're just poorly executed."

      "Pros: + Great app to pick up and learn. + Easy to use + Lessons are quick and easy to do in five minutes or less. + Built in goal setting and reminders + Nice\"gamification\" to keep you going. Cons: - Lessons are very surface level and not a replacement for more active learning. - Some questions are poorly worded. - Easy to advance without really learning concepts. - Some quizes seem bugged, where correct answers aren't accepted. - Expensive for what you get.",
      "It's a great app. I'm using it for game development (which is a pro course) and it helped me a lot. Gonna publish my game soon on this platform because of it ;) But I do hate how you can't write the code yourself. It gives you choices almost, but you never write the code yourself. You'll have to just observe and test on your own project. That's why I'm deducting a star.",
      "It's a great app for beginners or just to refresh your coding memory, also I suggest for the developers go make the question number and line green instead of red when I get an answer correct because It makes me think I got it wrong. Thank you for such a wonderful and well developed app!!",
      "This is *hands down* the best low-bar, super accessible, code learning software I have ever used. Every salient concept is not just explained but repeated again and again in short exercises, and I'm so hopeful that I will actually further my coding skills for real. Thank you Mimo devs!",
      "Mimo has excellent lessons and projects and competitions and streaks that guide your learning at your own pace but encourage you to maximize it. The pro version is worth the annual £20 as it allows further development of each section and the creative projects to show you what you can do with your skills. If you are not new to HTML, this might not be as useful, since you have to complete all the basics before getting on to anything difficult but it is a superb app for beginners!"

Excellent work by the developers and the guys who wrote the content. I'm learning React, Python (Advanced) and BlockChain. So much that I didn't know about the languages and concepts has been clarified. Cheers!",

It seems like it gives you the absolute facts in the app, then provides additional reading if you want to delve a little deeper. So far, thoroughly enjoying the experience!",

I bought the full personal package a couple years ago & recently recieved a free upgrade to access all languages! It was already more than worth the purchase so I am very grateful. If you actually want to start learning a language or brush up on your skills you won't regret the purchase!",
      "Great program. On desktop. The phone app won't let me log in, changed password, deleted and reinstalled, and restarted phone. \"Something has gone wrong\" well what exactly? Seems to be a new problem for me at least. Updated talked to support. They said nothing can be done until next update. When that happens I'm sure my review will go up too",
      "Cannot log into the app, no feedback is given besides \"something went wrong. Tried contacting customer support via live chat, waited for 30 minutes with no response. edit: The update has no effect, I still can't login. I paid for a three month subscription and have not been able to access the app after I paid. Waste of money.",
      "Pretty nice app. It stopped working just recently. It asked to log in but it was impossible. I tried to update, but it didn't help. I was able to fix the problem! I went to \"app info\" from Android. Clicked \"force stop\". Then clicked \"storage\" -> \"clear the cache\". After that I was able to log in, and everything seems to work right. I hope it helps someone else too! Do not clear the data. Only the cache. I think this is the best language learning app, when it works.",
      "Dear friends, do not buy any subscriptions until they solve the login issue! As many other users, I'm also unable to login since last week. If you buy a package now, you be in trouble like I am. New version 5.13.3 was said to solve the issue, but it doesn't. Support area gives no forecast for long term solution, so you may keep your Duolingo tasks meanwhile. ***UPDATE*** solved with version 5.13.4, almost 1 month without access."

      "Great app. Paid premium and enjoy been able to spend time each day listening to French uninterrupted. Only thing that could improve this would be to have translation in the karaoke section underneath the native language to aid learning.",
      "I love this app! I like leveling song lyrics. It's more excited and more effective way to study language and to develop your listening skills. 🤗",
      "Cool app, it allows you to learn languages in a funny way. Too bad there are not many songs though."

      "Quizlet is amazing! I use the free version, and still get everything I need out of Quizlet. Whether it's last-minute cramming or a study plan set weeks before a test, quizlet is a perfect tool. You can even include multiple languages, play games, use flashcards, and assess your skills. Teachers can use it for tests and quizzes too! Whether you're a student, teacher, or just a curious individual, get Quizlet and explore! Trust me😁",
      "I didn't know that flashcard apps were that advanced nowadays. I got the \"go\" premium membership to remove the ads, that's fair. Only complaint : The auto completion when creating sets is great, but the way it's made doesn't make much sense to me. I'm learning Russian vocabulary and the app picked that up very well, but as soon as I've written a Russian word it should suggest the English translation as a \"definition\" instead of suggesting the word I just typed.",
      "Needs improvement. Agree with the other comments. There needs to be a merge/split set option. Also, I like the scan document icon but only available when you first create the set then it disappears after you saved the set. Also, you can't delete the set from the folder on the app; and you can't shift the order of the cards by dragging it, it can only be done on the computer version but not the app.. Please also have an option to display which sets to display on the main page",
      "This app is the ultimate study guide. You can create multiple sets of cards. If a particular card stumps you every time you see it, click the star. You have the option later to study only the starred ones so you can concentrate on the things you need help with the most! Also, you can see similar questions & answers to what you're typing, allowing you to select those and save time. One suggestion would be to make finding & editing particular cards easier, instead of having to hunt thru the set.",
      "I got quizlet to help me learn French and it is very helpful because when you set the terms to french it would define it for you in the definition so you wouldn't have to keep on going back to google translate. Another helpful tool is the combine tool to mix two sets together in a game, a test, etc or you can make a whole new set with them. You can use the customize feature so if you like mostly all of a set that you found with the search tool you can just take the term out or add one in"

    "comments":[
      "Great idea, but few bugs affect the experience and updates are too infrequent. - the main problem is it does not check pronunciation of phrases on both my Android devices. In Apple version, after you recorded the phrase it shows which words you said correctly, but not for Android. The main competitor, Hello Chinese app, works correctly on my phone, so this was the deal-breaker for me. - In each lesson, first time you open it the first card is skipped. This is minor annoyance though.",
      "I really like the character writing prompts. More of those in a quiz format would be great. When introducing a new word, it would be nice to see the pinyin as well. Often, it's difficult to be sure of the pronunciation of a new character just from listening and that makes it more difficult to hold it in mind. Very good pacing.",
      "I'm really enjoying the app. There are some things I wish were more explicit, but language fluency requires details, which can be picked up over time. Maybe the app will go over some stuff later. Anyway, I like that it's a mixture of real people speaking videos and flash card associations with pictures. Love it.",
      "There are a few issues still on a couple of the multiple choice pages that still need to be ironed out but I love it. You can do the lessons multiple times to reinforce. You can have both character when learning then switch when you want to practice recognising Chinese characters. Also what you have learned reappears over again so you don't forget and build on what you know. I love the stories at the end of each chapter too. Really cute design. Good user interface. Would recommend.",
      "It is surprisingly fun to use this app for learning a language you thought it's impossible to learn. The interactivity is amazing and not getting boring, new challenges everywhere, short videos of native speakers, you can draw Chinese letters and record your own voice - just amazing tool and makes fun to learn a language! Highly recommended"

Special features like writing practice , pronounciation etc etc makes it even more practical.. Everything is satisfactory.. Thank you so much for such an amazing app... Love it!!😍😍..keep up the good work!!",
      "I love this app! I've used it before with Korean and French for vocabulary practice, but now I'm using it with Greek, which I literally just started learning. It's really helpful and the way they teach you helps you memorize the words and get them down pat easily. One thing I don't really like that much is that there's only 5 minutes, which kinda sucks when you're trying to write everything down and actually do the activities. I would really love if we had at least a few more minutes though.",
      "This app helps me so much in building basic vocab, and in memorisation. The simple 5-minutes a day idea makes me feel more productive, because I know I took my time to learn every day. I love this app, and I want to thank everyone who's behind it, but the reason why I rate it 3-stars is because my streak disappeared when I didn't even forget about it. It made me a bit upset, because I feel like my whole 'making sure I wouldn't sleep until I do my daily Drops' is totally wasted. Please help :((.",
      "This is one of few European Portuguese apps. Thus far I think the icons are poor and it has presented words well beyond my wants or needs. It is at least the dialect I need for my trip. Update, there seems to be no pattern of learning and basics are not happening. This program design does not give me confidence and has discouraged me from learning a new language.",
      "screen resolution and aspect ratio does not resize and adopt on my android box. I'm using CloudNetGo RK3399 android box. it is not about controls /touch controls but how your app/s displays adapt to different displays and devices. I barely see the whole app page and it does not display properly. I tested other mobile /devices. it only works on well known adroid model devices not for some mid ranges and android boxes."

      "It is a great app to learn coding. For ex. I am learning python. The reason why I gave 4 stars because there are some optional mini topics which you need pro version to understand. It's like taking money to learn.",
      "Great app, it could be more straight to the point giving more concepts at once, instead of very small pieces, however I understand it may be better like that for complete beginners.",
      "It's good because it teaches you the basics of coding. However, unlinke other websites like Codecademy, I don't like the fact that I have to pay to learn more basic coding tag, which I can learn for free in other platforms.",
      "You ever heard of a free trial? Spotify does it, Duolingo does it, Mimo does it, My Fitness Pal does it, MOST apps with a \"premium\" setting offer it... Not Encode! Too good for it. You're just supposed to guess if it'd be worth it or not.",
      "this app has made leaning to code fun and enjoyable. the app is very basic in the sense that even school kids could easily pick up how to code within weeks/months. so far i have only used the free side of this app and therefor cannot comment on the paid side to the site. thank you to the developers for such a great way to learn code. :)"

A good VERY basic start, but I finished much of it in an hour and it added very little to what I already knew, even despite never having taken any course on electrical systems ever.",
      "The application is put together really well for what it is. My biggest gripe with it is the broken english and terminology used. Not to say it's wrong, cause the terms used could be used in another region of the world. What I do know is that it's wrong for en-US speakers. If you're from the US I wouldn't try to use this app. Additionally, a dark mode would be A LOT easier on the eyes and I feel like having the user sign up or sign in with Google is unnecessary.",
      "This has the potential to be a great app, but there are a few issues. Someone needs to edit the content for grammar and accuracy. For example, at the beginning of chapter 4, the text has \"Because resistances are very small...\" where the word \"resistor\" should have been used. There are numerous examples of this throughout the app. Also, some of the test questions are vague and have 2 or more correct answers. If those issues are addressed, this would be a 5 star app!",
      "Quite impressed, ads aren't too intrusive, though the achievements seem to take a bit of time to register. Otherwise good content.",
      "It's thourough. Loads of ads but overall a good app with good content that works. It seems a little old fashioned or simple in format but I'll take simplicity over non functioning."

      "Excellent app, I've definitely improved my singing in the week that I've been using it. The exercises are really well paced and with a good progression from one to the next. 4*s as the western course is a bit short compared to the Hindustani & Carnatic courses. I'd consider getting a subscription if there was a bit more to the Western course, but it's hard to justify with the limited content that's there at the moment.",
      "This is really Nice app for Learning and practicing Music... I am CEO of my Cybersecurity Firm and I hardly get time to go out and learn music in classes but with this app I can get reference notation with analytical graph of my vocal pitch and can improvise...I think this is reqlly a blessing for me that feeds my musical practic and gives me portability to carry this whenever and wherever I want...",
      "Wonderful experience! I'm in love with RIYAZ App. Great idea 👍 Amazingly designed. I recommend this Application for every vocal singer for practicing music regularly. Thank you so much Riyaz!",
      "I would probably rate this 4.5 the only issue is there are no songs to sing, other than that its really amazing and I can already feel improvement in my voice!!",

      "Great flashcard app with both user-made and official courses. There is a paid option but the app is 100% useable in the free version. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can no longer access user-made courses for the first time from the app. Instead, you have to go into the internet in your phone, search for a memrise course you want, then open it using the app. After that it can be accessed from the app at any time. It's not a big deal, but it is a bit annoying.",
      "Forgot how awesome this app is. I practiced with the app about 4.5 years ago. It felt like a game. Then, I stopped. A few years later, I went to Duolingo and was shocked by how many words I remembered-- The random learning left its mark. And, even though I could not form sentences, I was primed for learning when I visited Seoul in 2017-- My ears and eyes were accustomed. Now 4 years later, I'm back and the upgrades are so cool. -- I get the sense of being in Seoul learning from people.",
      "After the 7 day free trial, I bought the annual subscription. I am mostly satisfied with the app, but I do have two complaints. My favorite feature of the app is \"learn with locals.\" It's super disappointing that once you move past the first level (and after the free trial period is up) that feature is no longer available. My second issue is that when I make a pronunciation mistake, the \"difficult words\" feature only has me spell, translate, and listen rather than pronounce.",
      "I've been using this app as supplemental learning for Korean. I've done the first 3 sections of Korean 1 and it's great. The best part is that the romanization is the same so it doesn't confuse me. The only thing is though, my books are geared toward teaching the polite form of phrases first while the app lessons are mixed. But, the app is really good at giving multiple sound examples. If I did not have my book lessons, this app would be a little hard to learn Korean, but still managable.",
      "I've been learning Turkish and the course is designed very intelligently. The subscription is very affordable. Teaching methodology is great but a simple tweek can make the app stand out for the five stars. It would be great if you add pictures with words. Obviously, the pictures shouldn't be visible during review but a visual effect of pictures helps memory last longer during learning new words. Because some people are not good in their imaginations ;)"

      "Poorly organized compared to similar online learning apps. Several major points for improvement: 1. Courses appear as list of HUGE tabs. Would recomend sizing them down for easier browsing. 2. Course content is very poorly organized and not everything can be run on the app. 3. At first there were no lecture videos. I had to start watching through the browser for them to appear, and even then only got the videos for that week of the course. 4. Why aren't videos streamed? Why must I download them?",
      "This is my favourite continuous education app. So far, I've only been using the free courses but yesterday, started my first edx certificate pursuit. Absolutely amazing how cheaply you can obtain knowledge from the world renowned experts! You can be really proud of your project and I'm really happy it's been successful for such a long time. Only one thing is missing - at the end of each course, you could provide a PDF summary of the knowledge obtained (e.g. for people who completed a course).",
      "Its really a wounderful platforme. Easy to register, to pay online....etc. I found solution to my programimg skills with edx. It helpful to biginers and also to those that want to improve their skills expriences. Its an online learning for all.",
      "Very interesting, but the lecture delivery too fast. It will be more interesting if delivered at a lower pace .",
      "Good resolution, and sound, also, backs to where one left before while watching, at for one lesson I have taken so far."

While listening to English music or watching English movies, TV series or news no matter how hard you try you don’t understand what they are saying? Well, that’s because you are not familiar with the English vocabulary words they are using. To communicate effectively in English, it is extremely necessary to have a good understanding and improve your English vocabulary. Learning English vocabulary won’t just make it easier to communicate, watching TV programs and listening to music but it will also help you to learn anything in the world you want to learn.\r\n\r\nAs learning and improving your English vocabulary can bring you so many benefits but it isn’t always easy to learn English vocabulary. While other vocabulary builder apps are providing you with complicated meaning that leaves you confused and bomber you with annoying pop-up ads, we focus on providing the premium quality user experience for free. \r\nThere are hundreds of thousand English vocabulary words you can learn, but not all the vocabulary words are useful. To save you time from learning unnecessary English vocabulary words, we hired expert teachers to collect a collection of important words for you. We exactly know what kind of problems people face while learning English vocabulary. Don’t you think sometimes vocabulary builder apps use unnecessarily complicated definition to define a simple word? That’s why we provide each word with a simple meaning and to make it even easier to understand, we provide many synonyms.\r\nAll English learners have had that embarrassing moment when you learn a word and somebody tells you that you are pronouncing the word incorrectly.

That’s why we provide plenty of example sentences which will surely give the idea of how to use the words in sentences in real life conversations. \r\nIn almost all vocabulary builder apps, you will find that there is a mechanism to learn words but there is no way to review words that you have learned. We know It is very important to revisit words after you have learned them. That’s why our vocabulary builder app has a separate section for your learned words. There are also separate sections for your favorite words and all the words in the app.\r\n\r\nSpaced repetition flashcards\r\n\r\nA learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review and testing of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.\r\nThe notion that spaced repetition could be used for improving learning was first proposed in the book Psychology of Study by Professor C.

      "The app is very useful for my child but sometimes when you are learning tigrina the voice doesn't match with the words.",
      "It is a good app but when you go to the word list/phrase book and tap \"play\" to listen to words, it automatically sets your speaker volume to the maximum level which is extremely loud. That is a really bad bug. Edit: You don't even have to tap the \"play\" button for this bug to occur, I don't know what screen it happens on, but it happened again, this time with my headphones in! It just changes your volume to maximum! Terrible!"

      "More than optimal at teaching language skills if the learner repeats phrases and words as they are taught, as well as writing down the conjugations (which are tappable, to a separate box) on a piece of paper. I know that may sound either drastically too much effort outside the app or too little effort by myself to wait for the application to move forward with lessons. The best way to learn is diversification so, here y'all go! 🙂 Have a good day.",
      "This app is pretty good for vocabulary-building, but there could be a good deal more grammar instruction. You cannot achieve basic fluency in a language without having at least a basic understanding the grammar. That's where most of these types of language programs fall short, and Mondly is no exception. Also, the scoring system has much room for improvement. I wish I could give it a better rating, but the deficiencies make it kind of average.",
      "The user interface is smooth and easy to use, and it's rather full of features, but there are two issues I have... one is that the clues are sometimes off -- for instance, I clicked on the verb and it said it meant \"ask\" despite it saying the full sentence as having the verb \"bit\" instead. Secondly, I started with Korean and it will give the option to show the words romanized or in hangul, but it isn't teaching me hangul.",
      "Great app for learning! Microphone is a bit wonky and playback in conversations cuts off FAST. Other times it takes several tries saying the same thing the same way to get it to understand. Biggest issue now is that undisclosed to the members is that if you review any lesson (day, week, or month) more than 10 times you only receive ONE POINT instead of up to max number of points for that lesson. ONE STAR UNTIL ADJUSTED!!!!😡😡😡",
      "i bought the full version. The user interface is very easy and the app works well. it does not present enough challenge to really test your abilities. it could do with more tests that are challenging to really consolidate what you know Subsequently my subscription came up for renewal. There was no way to cancel or renew. I contacted support and got no response. This is unacceptable"

      "Pretty good little app to remember where the notes are in a music sheet. Especially good if you already know how to read music sheet, but needs to read faster",
      "You *cannot\" have an app teach music where you can play a note that is lower on the keyboard and yet sounds higher and is written higher on the stave. This is really basic stuff! The concept of this is fantastic and the app is well made but, as a music teacher, I could not recommend this to kids as they will get confused! It's a shame as this is an app I would love to recommend kids use outside of the classroom but it just isn't accurate enough and will lead to wrong concept learning.",
      "I never thought great app like this existed! No ad! And it teach you step by step😊 not forcing us to rate the app and it's absolutely FREE! THANK YOU VERY MUCH ❤️ I'm really thankful because I can't afford piano lessons 😭 thank you for not being selfish ❣️😭 I Wish I can give you guys 500 STARS ☹️ ALL LESSONS ARE FREE ! THANK YOU GUYS!",
      "After having tried many of the other music training apps on the play store, Vivace is by far the best one! The app has a clean minimalistic design, an intuitive usage flow, and a great UI/UX",
      "Best trainer i have come across. Covers all clefs and key signatures. Helped me learn at a much faster speed."

      "This app seriously focusses well on learning for beginners. Lots of jargon is explained very simply, examples are given, things are repeated sometimes so it stays in your head easier and after some information you get a short quiz about what you read. Its structured well and easy to look back at things. I wish more educational stuff was made like this.",
      "This app has been wonderful in terms of breaking it all down. The way everything is worded for you, as well as the examples given, really help you to fully grasp & catch on to what they're saying the first time. You won't have to keep reading things over & over, confused as hell... they've done an excellent job of making knowledge that the normal consumer has access to but typically doesn't understand, understandable! I really appreciate this app.",
      "Just started using this app and I am happy to have found this. The explanations are easy to understand, with highlighted key points to learn certain terms used in the finance world.",
      "The app is okay for understanding basic financial terms. The quizzes need to be overhauled as the answers appear in the wrong order and often have more than one correct answer, when selected it will display as incorrect.",
      "Easy to read. Like the quiz and the prediction. I would do more predictions with explanations. Even an prediction mode to just learn by doing that. Nice graphics too."

    "comments":[
      "The distinction between free and paid content isn't clear enough (fixed) and, sometimes, an entire section within a lesson is subscription only. Also, developers should provide some sort of incentive for correcting other people's exercises (for example, for every 100 or 1000 corrections you get free Premium for a week or a month). Badgering people to pay can be annoying. At this point, I'd rather see third-party ads than pay for subscription.",
      "Good with room for improvement. I miss a pure grammar section, with explanations about structures and direct access to it (I had to get a book for that). Also, whenever you interrupt an exercise, you need to start from the beginning of the section, which isn't always bad. Compared to similar apps, on Busuu you have the chance to type some answers, good point. But it would be better if the exercises were more extensive, like \"translate this sentence into German\", prompting us to work harder.",
      "Its the best language learning app I ever tried, and I'm having so much fun! It explains the grammar really well, and I love that theres even a community where native speakers can help you get better. I only wish that I could favorite the grammar tip pages, as they are pretty crucial to the learning and I would like to be able to find them quickly if I forget how the grammar works",
      "The cool thing about this app is it gives you a free test, according to which your language level is being evaluated. It is very interactive and integrated for all language levels in a unique way. The examples given (to illustrate the meaning of certain words) are not easy at all for beginners. I believe this is not bad, but rather it strengthens learners' background of the structure as well as the common expressions in a particular cultural based language.",
      "Really cool app. Nowadays i am using this app in order to learn the Spanish. The content is really interesting and attractive and the same time it is abounded with fun which is helpful for learners. Also the content is full of videos that helps to practise the listening skill by just watching them. Really gonna say thanks for the developers. Great job! Muy interesante."

      "Straightforwardly, I prefer this app to simply piano by joytunes. I don't say that simply piano is bad, but flowkey is just much better to me. Flowkey provides a much better fundamental for beginners. Also, as I remember, unlike simply piano, I can skip lessons that I already know which is very convenient. I rate 4 stars since I have a problem with MIDI, whenever I plug in the MIDI cable, I hear no sound from either the phone or my organ. Can you guys fix it?",
      "This app is amazing. It has a great guide to learn the piano notes and songs. On the pace that you are comfortable with. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn piano. The only thing that bothers me a bit is that its a bit expensive. I think if it was a bit cheaper it would be accessible by more people. Another downside is that you cant technically download the sheet music. You can just view it and learn it online on the app. It would be good if you could download it though.",
      "Super buggy. Half the time during an exercise which is supposed to be waiting until the notes are played correctly it'll just goes on without me playing anything at all! Or if it's actually waiting for me it won't wait for me to play the second note when two of the same notes are supposed to be played sequentially. Just very unhappy I spent $120 on this.",
      "The constant pop-up to rate the app, even after paying for premium, is extremely annoying. The exercises repeat too many times with too many screen presses, taking hands off the keyboard. Courses are fairly limited. Fortunately I only subscribed for one month, but already regret the purchase",
      "I really wanted to learn how to read sheet music. And this app helped me so much. It starts with the basic and marginally raises the difficulty. Overall a great app."

      "Amazing. I play with friends and online. Simple, with lessons and puzzles. Options to do so free and to pay for premium for advanced teaching. No annoying ads. 5 stars I had a previous bad review for not being able to go back using my back button. But I realised I had to turn my 'game tools' off in my settings. Still would be nice if they had an on screen option to go back",
      "The update has been terrible. Piece movement is now less sensitive. It means that in one minute games you'll lose five seconds trying to move a piece that before the update would be done easily. There's also dating adverts and hot singles in your area coming up. Why would this ever be appropriate in a chess app? App update wasn't tested before release, because it's really poor. Update march 1st. Just updated and the same issues are still in the app!!! Why are the pieces so poor to react still?",
      "Search for 1min Chess960 seems to take a long time (understandable if not many play this option). Sometimes I will do a search walk away (because I know it takes a while to find an opponent), if I am white and do not make a move, I get a loss and points are deducted. Not sure if this is by design, but I do not believe that is fair, even if I am black. Update: pre-move fixed with the update, but other issue still persists.",
      "I'm very disappointed with the new update. Please revert the change or at least for it out as a \"chess classic\". It's not that I don't like change, it's removing functionality without any reason that is upsetting. I normally play against the computer and I'm trying to improve my game. So in case of a stupid mistake I don't want to resign and start over. I want to take back my move. It's a computer I'm playing, not a tournament.And why did the computer level go from 1-10 to 1-20? Popular request?",
      "The new UI is terrific but I'm suddenly being paired up with people who are nearly 200 points higher than my elo leading to more losses. What gives? Edit: 1) I have versed people nearly 300 elo higher than me. That's stupid. This feature just enables smurfs to troll easier. 2) I did wind up editing what elo I want to verse online but I still run into people way higher than my elo. Your system is broken. Can we please just go back to the old matchmaking?"

      "This is ridiculous. I used this platform before and always loved it. Now it's not working. More specific the mic. Yes I already checked the mic itself, the app has permission to use the mic as well. Also no background noise. Still doesn't work. It just doesn't seem to record anything and says try again over and over again. I did not pay so I could not use the mic function! Usually I never write reviews but now I am actually mad. Not cool.",
      "It's def a great app ,just by taking the first lesson I can tell I would learn the language fast with this app. The only downside is you have to buy a monthly subscription. The price is the reason I'm giving it 3 stars. Please consider lowering the cost so It can be more affordable and more people can have access to it.",
      "The only thing that stops this getting 5 is the inability to change the size of the text. I would like to make the words slightly larger to make it easier . Update 15th March 2020- Also the listen and complete is painful. In other parts of lessons when you press the sleaker button it says it slower and the press again it says normal speed but not in listen and complete. It needs to be the same.",
      "I'm lazy and it's hard to stay motivated but the different formats and repeated usage of the same language and in a conversation setting really help. It seems expensive with so many free apps but a \"Spanish for dummies\" or other language learning book from the local book shop isn't much cheaper if at all.",
      "Major drawback is not being able to select vocabulary for review myself. Also, a lot of the translations are ambiguous. Often I had to use a different program to determine the meaning of a word. The meaning of a word should be provided, not just a single word translation that can have many interpretations."

    "description":"It's never too early to start your child's education. Preschoolers, kindergarteners, toddlers, and older kids are eager to learn their ABCs, counting, addition, subtraction, and more! The best way to encourage that is to share smart, well-made educational apps and games with them on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nMath Kids is a free learning game designed to teach young children numbers and mathematics. It features several mini-games that toddlers and pre-K kids will love to play, and the more they do the better their math skills will become! Math Kids will help preschoolers, kindergarteners, 1st graders to learn to identify numbers and start training with addition and subtraction puzzles. They'll have a great time completing games and earning stickers, and you‘ll have a great time watching them grow and learn.\r\n\r\nMath Kids features a number of puzzles that teach while your child plays, including:\r\n• Counting - Learn to count objects in this simple game of addition.\r\n• Compare - Children can build their counting and comparing skills to see which group of items is bigger or smaller.\r\n• Adding Puzzle - A fun mini-game where kids create math problems by dragging numbers on the screen.\r\n• Adding Fun - Count the objects and tap on the missing number.\r\n• Adding Quiz - Put your child's math and addition skills to the test.\r\n• Subtracting Puzzle - Fill in the missing symbols in the math problem.\r\n• Subtracting Fun - Count the items to solve the puzzle!\r\n• Subtracting Quiz - See how much your child has improved in their mathematics skills for subtraction.\r\n\r\nWhen kids can play while they're learning, they're much more likely to recall information. It also makes them want to learn more frequently, which will give them a huge boost when they start kindergarten.\r\n\r\nMath Kids also comes with a number of features that help adults monitor and manage their child's progress. Customize game modes to increase or decrease the difficulty, or check report cards to see scores for previous rounds.\r\n\r\nMath Kids is the perfect introduction to the basics of counting, addition, and subtraction. It will teach your toddler, kindergartener, 1st grader sorting, and logical skills along with early mathematics, giving them the perfect foundation for a lifetime of learning.\r\n\r\nNote to Parents:\r\nWhen creating Math Kids, we focused on building the best possible learning experience for children of all ages. We're parents ourselves, so we know exactly what makes a good educational game, as well as what doesn't. We released Kids Math as a completely free game with no in-app purchases or third party ads. Math Kids is full featured, frustration free, and ready to go. It’s exactly the kind of educational app we want for our children, and we think your family will enjoy it, too!\r\n\r\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios",

      "I love the content, but the actual app is pretty glitchy. Trying to resume a lesson often plays one 2-3 lessons back. It's something you learn to work with, but still, for content delivered by professionals and leaders of their respective industries, it'd be nice to watch it on a more polished app",
      "This was a gift. My husband knows how much I enjoy learning a little bit of everything, so this was such a perfect gift for me. I am absolutely enjoying this app! So far I've watched Gordon Ramsay, Sara Blakely and Jeff & Rich... They're all very informative and fun to watch. I totally recommend checking this app out. He got us both the year subscription and we both are enjoying it. I look forward to getting thru all the Mater Classes by the end of the year! Thank You!",
      "Love, love, LOVE the courses on Masterclass!! Life changing. No joke. If you only watch one (which, you can't, they're like Pringles) watch Chris Voss. Also, the app is soooo streamlined. I think of it as the Netflix of personal development.",
      "I haven't even used the app yet (I saw it's Recommendation through a post by \"SUCCESS SECRETS\" on YouTube), but from the reviews/comments I am already seeing from individuals who have actually had an experience with MasterClass, I just know This Is The App \"I (we, you, people like us)\" NEED TO HAVE... 'If you know what I mean' I feel like this app will really ease the stress, whatever the goal, focus, dream, ambition... is. Good job in anticipation, team... I'll comment again in one month.",
      "I love the content, but the app is really frustrating. If you watch your lessons on your TV with Chromecast, the app doesn't remember which lessons you watched or where you stopped watching. So you have to remember what you did or did not see, but if you watch a couple of different masterclasses... That can be a bit of a struggle. Also difficult to highlight your favorite lessons or teachers. (or to remove enrollment from a lesson if you didn't like it."

      "I love this app, worth the price, easy to understand and a great way to learn to play piano. Yes, Iwould like it to have more songs I knew, but I also understand that the rights to songs cost $ for the developers, so I prefer not to be so demanding and appreciate all the work thwyve put into what they currently have because I have learned quite a bit from zero. Kiitos!",
      "To be honest, it's a great app. I tried out most of the instruments, including ukulele, piano, and guitar, and it really helped me learn from beginner to pro. It can be frustrating sometimes with the constant ads for the paid version, but I don't really mind. Highly recommended for playing any instrument. Obviously, this is just an extension of the full app, Yousician. I'm not sure why they need a whole separate app just for one instrument, since all of the other options are in the same app, meh",
      "Not only is it terrable, but boring. Forcing you to play along to tunes (apparently tunes) that you have never heard of force you to lean classical music reading which I have zero interest. I have been playing the guitar for more than 40 years and I have made good money at it . I've never had to learn to read a note of music, I still can't and don't want to start. This program is only just alright if you want to restrict your MUSICIANship to strict guidelines and have no intention of creativity",
      "The app is generally great but has a lot of problem. Firstly whenever Im trying to practice in learn mode it never shows me which buttons to start with and always lacks a button therefore I have to do the same thing at least twice to understand also it usually doesnt reads the key even though Im playing it right. If it wasnt for the trial I would have never played it.",
      "So there are 2 plans (which is very stupid) I already pay for the premium app but now if I want to play 'popular' song, then I have to pay for premium+ The app is fine but the pricing options are terrible"

    "description":"The Flashcards App is a powerful tool to build your vocabulary or to memorize and study anything.\r\n\r\nYou can not only create question-answer flashcards, but also flashcards with pictures and even multiple choice flashcards.\r\n\r\nIt's also very easy to share your flashcards with your classmates, fellow students and friends.\r\nThis is especially interesting if you are a teacher who wants to share flashcards with your students.\r\nAnd of course you can also send your flashcards from your mobile phone to your tablet and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe app can also read out your flashcards in other languages. That makes learning new languages like Spanish, French, German or Chinese much easier.\r\nOther features include question and answer swapping, shuffled flashcards and answers, a countdown function, different learning modes and easy drag-and-drop sorting of your flashcards. You can even format the text of your flashcards to highlight important words or phrases. The following styles are available for that: Bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough and text color.\r\n\r\nDetailed evaluations of your success and learning progress will also help you achieve your learning goals.\r\nThere is also a backup feature that let's you upload your flashcards to our new Studyoo.com platform for free.\r\nThat way your flashcards are secured even if you ever should loose your phone.\r\n\r\nFrom elementary school to high school, whether for your high school diploma or simply for your homework: the Flashcards app prepares you and supports you on your way to better grades. \r\n\r\n---------- \r\n\r\nYou can create up to 50 flashcards with the free version of the app. Other than that there are no limitations. If more flashcards are needed you can unlock the Pro version for a small one-time-payment from within the app. After that you can create an unlimited number of flashcards. \r\n\r\n---------- \r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions for improvement, please let me know so that I can work on updates.

      "I love this game. My 2,3 and even 5 year old LOVE it and are very engaged. For $8 a month is nothing. This app keeps them engaged and happy, laughing at the funny videos and bragging about new skills. Sounds crazy but it's great. MY ONLY COMPLAINT is the sticker games. You have to do it with your child for the best benefit. Sometimes the games won't go to the next level so we have to redo the entire area but it's honestly not a big deal because they're still having fun.",
      "My family really enjoys the app when it works. I seem to have constant issues opening the app. We ruled out the internet connection being an issue, we attempted to open on different devices yet no luck. It works when it wants to. I've uninstalled & reinstalled & even upgraded our account but the problem still continues.",
      "My kid is only 3.5 and we read to him every night but I never really pushed him to sound things out or write on his own. Then he started playing around on this app and he's SO INTO IT! He is really starting to recognizesight words and tries spelling and sounding out words in our nighttime stories. The letters he's tracing on the screen look awesome. The breaks he gets to draw and play along hispathway give him the break that keeps us BOTH more comfortable with this early learning.He's having fun",
      "I appreciate that this program offered a 1 month free trial. I had been interested but afraid to try. Now I see Homer is absolutely worth the monthly rate. My son loves electronics, of course. And I always try to limit them for all the behavior and health reasons pediatricians warm us about. This app lets my son play electronic games while building his kindergarten reading skills! This app has given us both something we want and we both enjoy it!",
      "Great app until the recent update. Crashed constantly, I tried uninstalling & reinstalling the application and still wouldn't load. Contacted service and they were great at resolving my issue in a timely matter. My daughter loves this app and is only 20 months and learned to identify letters and colors. Everyday she says a new word! Definitely worth every penny."

      "this app is great .i learn so many things using this app, actually i learning sql before two months but i face difficulties in learning, so one of my friend suggested this app, he said that you can try this app for learning in a easy way, than i am try and really my experience is very good, so i am suggesting this app for all people who start learning sql, it is very helpful and you learn in a easy way, so why are you dependent on other peoples and these books,where you feel not better.",
      "perfect for absolute beginners, expacially non-tech people. I reccomed to not get hang up too much on the \"comments\" from other users in the app's lessom forum: some are incorrect and you end up getting confused. Others are super useful. perhaps check them out at the end of the full Module. if you start to struggle, suspend your judgement for a few lessons. If after 3/4 steps you do not understand, only then go back.",
      "This application is incredible as it clearly defines foundational knowledge and builds on itself. It doesn't assume you already know everything about SQL which is great for people who want to increase their value as an employee but don't know where to start. This is a highly sought after skill.",
      "Good for reading about sql, absolutely useless for practicing knowledge. 1) Most questions are obvious even from just reading the question, not even the text it attempts to quiz you on. 2) There's no option to skip ahead, so almost doubly useless for anyone but absolute beginners."

      "I love this app. It helped me learn Hirigana and Katakana. It's pretty useful for learning symbols if you have the free one. My only problem is: where is Kanji? I looked through all the levels and just cannot find Kanji lessons. I just find this one effective and don't want to download a separate app for Kanji. Besides that, it's good.",
      "Superb! I learned many languages from many sources and apps before but Bunpo is the best. What I like the most is it provides the basic we need and divides courses according to the assessment exam levels. With this way, it saves me from studying aimlessly. I can see which exact level I am and what I need to learn more in order to step up to the next level.",
      "I've only learnt a very small amount of Japanese in the past, so I'm a bit rusty. I've only been going through the basics and it makes it easy and simple for me to refresh my memory. I'm hoping that this app will help me expand my knowledge and get to a basic level of conversation. I'm not only using this but it's a good app to supplement and practice.",
      "Loving this app so far. My only problems with it is that it can be a bit slow sometimes, especially when first starting up compared to other apps. I'd also suggest making the buttons for typing the letters way bigger. I find myself having to really concentrate on hitting the right one.",
      "This app is perfect for more advanced levels, as the study activity varies with specific grammatical usage patterns and conversation flow. This app really allows the user to engage in the content and allow themselves to be challenged based on their knowledge. I definitely recomment having a good solid background of the language before hitting proficient when selecting your level. Great study tool!"

      "So far this app is how it is described. It reads to you in your target language with your native language below. You have to download what you want to read so keep an eye on your storage. Some lessons have quizzes at the end and some do not. There are different \"authors\" and different subjects so you can find your favorite writing style. It's nice I can replay the audio. (I suggest closing your eyes as it reads out loud to train your ear.)",
      "Nice app, and I bought the premium because I liked it and I still do but I don't think there are any special benefits for premium users...? Which is a shame, and the news section is good except the translation is not perfect(automated translation) and the narrator is a robot. I expected it to be the same quality as the stories. If you are using the app, staying as a free user is a nice idea. I hope they add more features for us premium users.",
      "I like the idea a lot, and the execution of the app is OK. As far as I can see, a 10€ per annum subscription would be mostly to just unlock the current content. But there doesn't seem to be much new content added regularly. Whilst unlocking the current content is probably worth 10€ to most people, personally I'd rather pay 5€ a month on this platform for two or three current news stories every week, and two or three new magazine articles a week, all read by native speakers.",
      "I enjoy listening and following along with the texts. There are options to listen at full, 3/4, or 1/2 speeds. The split screen is great to check my understanding with the English text. Some of the narration isn't exactly like the text, but I think that makes it authentic, when you read aloud you often substitute words.",
      "I put 4 stars now because I didnt use much yet the app and changed my attitude because you changed - opened languages for not premium users! Thank you! That's good! I can try and understand how its useful."

You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of French grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\r\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\r\n\r\nThis is how the future of language courses looks like\r\nThe App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn French phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.\r\n\r\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\r\n\r\nCrystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.

      "I've used different language apps before and this is the easiest one to learn with. I can go as fast or as slow as I want. I can repeat the recorded word or phrase over and over so I get the pronunciation correct before moving on. Some of these apps move way to fast which makes the content easier to forget and harder to pronounce correctly. This app is just my pace. Great app!",
      "At first I thought that it is a good app (Everything was good) but , after when I have completed one lesson and moving to the next lesson 'chatbot' it was asking money to unlock , I could not afford money so can't we learn ! I am sorry it's only for those who can afford money! I am not that much happy for this app. Needs improvement",
      "Seems like a great app to recall and refresh stuff already learned. But it has a problem on my device attempting to use the mic. It tells me to tap and hold to use but never really connects. Never activates the mic no matter how long I press it. And then it begins to force close on me. That kind of sucks. Update. Not free at all. Functions stop quickly without pay. Use Duolingo te really learn for free. To answer your response, it won't be necessary. I'm using an actual free app. See above.",
      "Its a really good app for beginners like myself because of the repetition, but for some reason the app keeps glitching and the audio stops working for me after a few minutes of using the app. And sadly when it does this you have to exit the lesson and restart, which is really annoying. If that bug gets fixed it would be really good.",
      "By far the best language learning app I have ever tried. Focuses on functional learning so you basically hit the ground running with learning how to speak your chosen language. Other apps are too heavily focused on vocabulary before anything else which is not always the most ideal when learning a new language as an adult. Have used this app for learning other languages (Afrikaans) and it is great."

      "Fell in love with this app immediately. It is very intuitive and simple to use. Very complete. Learning languages with songs. You have a Vocabulary, Listening, Translating and Singing section ! All of them with different levels of difficulty. The only one down side to it is the excessive amount of ads in the free version , every time you finish, discard or start an activity, there is a 6 seconds add.",
      "The apps does have a few glitches, like syncing of lyrics, lack of pause during playing. But I love it for learning Spanish. I enrolled the subscription after 1 day of trial.",
      "If you are a music person, this has all of the potential to make learning another language a completely addictive experience! I am totally hooked and loving it! It still has quite a few frustrating points (hence the lower rating), but pick a favorite song, do the lessons, and have a blast from there. If you hit a snag (which is very likely right now), report it and make the app better for everyone.",
      "A good idea but the songs I tried in Italian are not translated well or have word added that are not suppose to be there, so when you practice it always say you have it wrong. I might try it again later if it gets better I tried the option to improve the translation. It only send a message and doesn't change what is already there",
      "Love the app it's exactly what I have been looking for and with this new update it's even better. love this app and now ik the meaning to all my favorite songs and learn how to sing them 2. Love this app 😍❤️"

      "The app is amazing. I earlier had this app but lost it when the phone was rebooted, but it was too good to be left out. The only problem i have is that though they introduced new features, they can only be used by buying them. Can't the team be a little more considerate and provide us with some in-app games/quiz or something like that through which we can earn coins and then use them to buy the locked( premium) lectures. Please do that since not all people can afford to pay for their hobbies.",
      "Minus a star due to a new problem after update: the app crashed in the new dialogue excercise, after switching the roles (at the end). Lost all the progress, of course. The app seems to got confused who should speak when. I like the app a lot - nicely structured, convenient. Works well for me. And I like one feature in the old version that didn't make it to the new - the games.",
      "I like it. I am learning slowly and incrementally. Liked the features. Sometimes the natives are super fast and unclear. Good to have the slow pace feature. The only thing that is so so is the character writing. I would rather write on a piece of paper. It takes too much time because my finger doesn't line up exactly with character strokes.",
      "I first got this app about a year ago and then stopped using it for several months. Back then it was still very good. I redownloaded it the other day and I was blown away at how much it has changed. It gives you practice activities which repeat themselves to help you memorize, but in a way that is less repetitive than Duolingo, and with a large variety of sentences. It just does an amazing job at efficiently teaching all aspects of the language, while giving you the option to skip parts you know",
      "I love this app! I used the free version for a few months and had a lot of fun with it: very well designed (content and user interface), no ads, a lot of material and adjustable audio speed. Then I upgraded to Premium+ and I very much enjoy the review with native speakers as well as the immersion classes. Ah yes, and they are also amazing in taking user feedback into account – very personal, fast, friendly and smooth!"

      "A good game and i like the new ways to get added resources however, game is now so unbelievably rigged its absurd. And its so obvious. You vould be winning over and over but then you chose to take the challenge of winning two battles in a row and all of a sudden it goes win lose win lose over and over. I think this seriously needs fixing. Or atleast make it less obvious. I mean for the bots theres like 4 variations of base layouts. It gets kinda dull when ur always attacking the same layout. It's amazing application. Working very much. And greatt help me and my son very good apps . Dhamaka app he madaro.",

      "It's a very good app to exapnd your vocabulary. When you forget your session, It reminds to go practice. Content can be repeated if not well understood. You given a word and it's similarity plus antonyms. Moreover, how the words can be used in a sentence. Also, short quiz after finishing the session to make sure you understood the meaning well. It's awesome!!🙂",
      "It can be good especially with the notifications that remind you to practice, but for an all meant to improve English, it doesn't understand syntax. It often asks in the notifications a yes or no question, but never gives yes or no as an option. For any higher of a rating, this blantant issue should be fixed.",
      "Enjoyed the app for the most part expect for the quiz and questions that change your answer from the one you click on then swipe to the next page so you can't see that it's wrong until the summary shows you what you missed and it's not the answer you submitted (I've done it multiple times now). Pretty annoying to get a 70% and only 5/20 coins back despite answering every question right. This is definitely keeping me from buying the full version. Why would I want to pay for this?",
      "Best app for learning English language. Please add a feature to open multiple course or mini course at same time, so that we can learn simultaneously. And also add the dictionary feature also.. at least in pro. It should include pronunciation, part of speech, synonyms, antonyms etc of each word. Pro users should have some extra perks otherwise what's the meaning of paying for premium.",
      "I love it !!! I purchased the lifetime membership with a reasonable discount price ...And I definitely won't regret it...It has tons and tons of vocabulary with creative, pictorial and fun way...Not only vocabulary but also phrases, proverbs, Grammar parts and the lists goes on...I really appreciate all the team members for their untiring work...I will strongly recommend it anyone who decides to improve their language skills..Keep going !! 😀😀😄😄"

      "The app is really good for beginners. But it troubles me everytime by insisting to install \"all in one\" app, which spoils the learning mood. Moreover, I couldn't toggle back to the old lessons. Is this a glitch or is it being put on purpose to boost the installations of other apps? I truly don't know what rating to be provided for the best learning experience and worst toggling experience. So is 3 rating.",
      "Do not download this app. It is impossible to do the quizzes as there is an ad at the bottom for their new app that prevents users from progressing. If you want to learn, you will have to download their new app, which has the same exercises, but seems to have lessons for other coding languages? However, if they wanted us to use the new app, the least they could have done is deleted this app, which is essentially useless now. It may be Thanksgiving break but I'm not very thankful for this app.",
      "This app is good , its quite alright but why is it impossible to access the quiz and move on to the next module? Is it compulsory to download thee new app? I'm okay with this one. The app is good, but it just doesn't give room to proceed to the next without downloading the new one.",
      "Garbage. Installed only to receive message asking to download the new version despite having just installed it one day earlier and there not being an update in play. This message prevents you from continuing to access material."

      "Great app but would be great if pictures could be displayed bigger, cuz sometimes you find a word or a definition on a webpage and is eassier to just save it instead of transcript it, but by now you can't read ot as the image is small. Great idea for the payed edition.",

      "Content wise pimsleur is great, I find it very fun and easy to learn with this method. Unfortunalty this app has some bugs, but the Web version still works very well. //for devs The main bug seems to occur mostly when the screen is off. It desyncs the duration bar(or wheel in the case of this app) making it slower, when you switch the screen on it then tries to catch up to where its supposed to be. But if you have finished the lesson it will crash when it reaches the 30 minute mark.",
      "I really love this app because it is effective, however, when listening to my lessons, the audio will randomly stop",
      "Excellent content buggy app. Given other reviews I can see that the issue is not my phone, but the app itself. There's issues with it lagging when I choose options and there's an annoying time lag that prevents me from being able to pause the content until it catches up. The lag causes the lesson to freeze and get cut off which makes it super difficult to remain engaged with the lesson. I love the content and focus on pronunciation. Part of me wishes there were transcriptions of the lessons.",
      "Very easy to learn basics and learn how to apply them in conversations. Very useful and clear app with good examples and activities to quickly learn the language.",
      "Updated review: excellent content, frustrating non-native app experience. Pimsleur fixed some bugs like the time seek control, but the app is still laggy and unstable; I have to force-restart it multiple times per week. Volume ~50% too low compared to other apps. Frustrating, but worth it for the content. Still recommend to everyone. — May 31,2019 review: three stars. Excellent content, frustrating non-native app experience. [Bug report.] Frustrating, but absolutely worth it for the content."

      "It's a pretty good app when there is decent internet connection, but on a poor connection it isn't working as well. Works better with airplane mode on in those cases. Devs: Sometimes seems to hang as if waiting for a timeout. Will also crash if the play store isn't installed (one of my phones doesn't have it). Would be really good if you could explicitly go into an offline mode like Spotify.",
      "Hello Udemy team, I have an issue regarding the screen resolution. I cannot watch the videos in full screen body ratio. The width of the videos are fixed to certain level. And we cannot even zoom. As you can see when I play a video in YouTube. I can get Full screen display ratio. It would be better user experience. If you update it to the full screen size ratio. and also great helpful for mobile user's. Please look into it and let me know. Thank you. Kind regards.",
      "What a time waste app. I bought bunch of courses.but wen i try to download them in my phone it won't download, it won't show already downloaded videos, shows wrong info. App is slow and black screen some times. It's really frustrating. I did uninstall and reinstall 4 times to perfectly download my course. But it says all wrong info.sometimes it says course downloaded, but the videos not downloaded completely 😡. It shows 24 downloaded.but actually 3 or 4 only completed. Worst app. No to rating.",
      "Edit: Changed my rating after fixing a bug listed below. Thank you! The udemy app lets me watch course videos, download course videos for offline viewing, play videos in the background (listen to course videos without unlocking my device), cast course videos to my screen, and buy new courses. Edit: This bug listed below was fixed after the first review (thank you): The course progression doesn't save very well. This causes confusion when I return to courses.",
      "I like the app but there are a few glitches I am facing recently. They are, 1) Even after downloading the whole course I am unable to view it when my internet is turned off or my phone is in poor network zone. 2) Recently I have bought a new course but I am unable to make the course offline, the download button does not work. Hoping to hear on a resolution soon for you. Thanks & Regards, Kevin Rodrigues"

      "The app is great. I like the type of teaching, it's fun and easily. BUT it costs $3.99 to $9.99 a month so it is not free. If you don't buy it ads pop up continuously. Also many lessons shown on the dashboard are locked out. You are allowed a lesson, then a break. I am now waiting 15 minutes (no, 15 HOURS!) to access the next lesson, after using the app for less than 10 minutes (with 6+ ads!). You are also immediately bombarded with emails until you unsubscribe from them. So a very pushy app!",
      "I'm really impressed! This app works like most language-learning apps, but it also has a chat feature that I've not seen anywhere else. It was fun, and it helped me learn to pronounce things correctly. It would definitely help to pay for it, but it seems like maybe things can be unlocked naturally, though I'm only a few days into using it.",
      "Fun and like a game but slow learning, you have to get premium to progress which is not very good for someone who really wants to learn. But it is fun to play and you learn some basic words",
      "It's a really good app, I love the way it teaches but still not sure if the way they pronounce the words is the way they are meant to be said or just a strong pronunciation on the developer's part.",
      "The app seems great but I am unsure if it is teaching the right words. For example it says that the Italian word for hobby is hobby. I find that hard to believe considering the Italian alphabet doesn't have a Y and according to a Italian/English dictionary it is translated as passatempo. It also teaches the Italian word for basketball is basket. It places doubt whether or not this app will be teaching me wrong."

Apart of this, it's really great. I do recommend it. I have easy fun for real :-) And I love that the support answers almost immediately and resolve my issue. The app is really great. I enjoy it more and more!",

Last, but not least, the FunFun Staff is very responsive and eager to help. Many thanks from Happy Me Gamer!",

      "I used to love this app a lot 5-6 years ago, and I was able to make a lot of friends online thanks to it. However, I don't like how the app now locks you to a specific language, something which wasn't the case before. For example, even though I was learning Japanese, I did have the opportunity to talk to people from Korea and elsewhere. I kinda miss that facility. HelloTalk, I hope you guys would be able to bring that feature back, as well as keeping it free and not making us pay for it. Cheers!",
      "I really love this app. There are so many people to talk to and it is a safe environment! I docked off 3 stars because a lot of the time it will say I have no network, and so i have to force the app to stop, then re enter. This happens even when I do have network. It's frustrating to have to constantly exit and enter the app. If this problem was fixed, i would definitely give the other 3 starts. Other than that, this app is amazing!",
      "At first it was a great app 4.5/5 stars, But now they began changing the native language of people according to their nationality, which is frustrating for people like me who have complicated backgrounds, otherwise it's a good app. I hope they fix it as soon as possible.",
      "Love this app, but it has lots of bugs, notifications and text not on time, and many times I need to close the app and open it again. In the same in time is nice that we can learn different languages."

    "description":"Learn Japanese with 5 minutes of practice daily. Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core Japanese words and Japanese phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. If you want to learn beyond the basics, there are also Japanese grammar lessons available. It’s even great for kids!\r\n\r\nWith Mondly you can learn Japanese sentences and expressions FREE with daily Japanese language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.\r\n\r\nThe secret path to language learning\r\nRemember the Japanese language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Japanese grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way.\r\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\r\n\r\nThis is how the future of language courses looks like\r\nThe App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Japanese phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.\r\n\r\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\r\n\r\n- Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right Japanese pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\r\n\r\n- State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Japanese words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Japanese clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\r\n\r\n- Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Japanese. Mondly teaches you Japanese vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into bite-size chunks and puts them into themed packs of lessons.\r\n\r\n- Learn conversational Japanese. Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Japanese vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak Japanese clearly.\r\n\r\n- Verb conjugations. Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Japanese verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\r\n\r\n- Statistics that make sense. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\r\n\r\n- The Leaderboard. We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\r\n\r\n- Adaptive Learning. We wanted to craft Mondly in such a way that it will suit every learner’s needs, even complete beginners. Along the way we noticed that learning Japanese is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.\r\n\r\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Japanese lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language. Kids will love it as well.",

      "I honestly like the app, the interaction and chatbot at least sharpens my pronunciation and conversation experience. I have no qualms with how they help you learn BUT- BUT after finishing one lesson or so, EVERYTHING ELSE MUST BE PAID FOR. I can live with pop-ups appearing and telling me to go premium every lesson but, to NOT have access to basically everything else is just bad. Most people can't afford it. I'm just gonna finish my remaining lessons and uninstall it since it's basically useless.",
      "Great even for free. Obviously paid gets you more content, but if you just casually want to dabble in learning a new language this app is great. If you're taking a class or about you travel, get the paid version. If you're like me and want to spend 5 min a day on a new language, the free version is perfect for you!",
      "Its Okay, Ive spent about 5 minutes working through the entire 'Hello' section of the japanese app to find that the phrases being taught are pretty rude. I know a fair bit of basic japanese but havent spoken in a while so i wanted to refresh my memory. A lot of this is causal speech, not what you would really use to a total stranger. On top of that, theres a fair few phrases in the 'vocabulary' that wasnt even taught. Please if youte going to teach a highly polite language, do it properly.",
      "I love this app, it's great and I've been using it for a while to do daily lessons & I add random weekly and monthly challenges to keep me on my toes but SO OFTEN after spending a significant amount of time doing a monthly challenge I don't get credited the points so it's all for nothing. Now I have to slalom through the monthly quizzes to avoid ones I don't get credits for completing. I've reported bugs repeatedly but I never get a response nor does the problem get resolved. Come on Mondly.",
      "Ich höre gar nichts. So ist diese App, wie schön auch, momentan nicht zu benutzen. 10 days after I tried the app (and got no sound), the developers asked me for feedback. So I reinstalled the app again. You have to authorize payment of the monthly subscription before you can even try the app. But since the trial period is ridiculously short (7 days), I was no longer elegible for the free trial. My good intentions to provide feedback cost me 10 euro. This is a practice I dislike, so bye bye app🤬"

      "Terrible new app. I've been a huge fan of the Great Courses for many years. This new app is almost unusable. Crashes regularly (on multiple devices). Has all sorts of weird bugs (also on multiple devices): opens to blank screen, or says I'm offline when I'm not, or shows an empty watchlist, or goes to blank screen when I hit a button and I have to force shut down the app. My phone has even started to warn me about how unstable the app is (my tablet hasn't yet, but I expect it soon).",
      "Now what?! You are going from bad to worse. After years of use I'm about to cancel my subscription. I use it on the road for education on the go. The app is a no go. The update is a total failure. Go back to the app edition of 2019. Work on it a lot more, then Beta Test it to death before imposing it upon us. ATTENTION GOOGLE PLAY STORE: Force this company to rollback to the 2019 edition.",
      "Version 5.05 still does not store files on SD card! New interace now hides info and blocks video with a big pause button when you tap to see progress. Very slow to load watchlist. Needs a \"download entire course\" option instead of requiring the user to download each individual lecture. Downloads list scrambles the course images so they do not match the lectures. On the upside, video and audio now sync nicely when played at faster speeds.",
      "I was a heavy user of the previous version of this app and it was great! I love The Great Courses Plus and the app was simple but effective. Now the new version, I'll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the \"Downloads\" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can't we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I'm downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing. Not a problem but annoying and looks unprofessional.",
      "I have a pro subscription. Superb courses and highly recommend the content. However the new app is so much worse than before. It hadn't improve my experience and the contrary. I am streaming via Google cast to my TV, the episodes are interrupted very often. The biggest problem is that the new background servuces drain the battery of my phone. It is not OK the work the whole day while I am not watching. When you look into the Android statistics it used 70% of the battery."

I don't think learning something should cost that much time or money personally but I understand the developer needs to make a living also. Suggest more coins per day. At least enough to unlock one each day.",
      "Good to learn intermediate level code skills. Very in depth other than the fact that they don't really show you how the commands they teach actually play out (look) on-screen. It's good to learn the operations, but what exactly am I doing within the operation in relation to the command I am attempting to perform within the program?",
      "Great way to get some good basic understanding of how different kinds of code works. Would be nice if you could go through the lessons a little faster.",

Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core Vietnamese words and Vietnamese phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. If you want to learn beyond the basics, there are also Vietnamese grammar lessons available. It’s even great for kids!\r\n\r\nWith Mondly you can learn Vietnamese sentences and expressions FREE with daily Vietnamese language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.\r\n\r\nThe secret path to language learning\r\nRemember the Vietnamese language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Vietnamese grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way.\r\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\r\n\r\nThis is how the future of language courses looks like\r\nThe App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Vietnamese phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.\r\n\r\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\r\n\r\n- Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right Vietnamese pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\r\n\r\n- State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Vietnamese words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Vietnamese clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\r\n\r\n- Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Vietnamese. Mondly teaches you Vietnamese vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into bite-size chunks and puts them into themed packs of lessons.\r\n\r\n- Learn conversational Vietnamese. Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Vietnamese vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak Vietnamese clearly.\r\n\r\n- Verb conjugations. Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Vietnamese verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\r\n\r\n- Statistics that make sense. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\r\n\r\n- The Leaderboard. We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\r\n\r\n- Adaptive Learning. We wanted to craft Mondly in such a way that it will suit every learner’s needs, even complete beginners. Along the way we noticed that learning Vietnamese is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.\r\n\r\nBefore you know it, at the end of these Vietnamese lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language. Kids will love it as well.",

      "Pro's: The app has a good concept where you can talk into the microphone and practice the right sounds/ tones. It has a chat bot to also practice with. 10/10 for that idea Cons: it does most of the talking. So you learn words fast but its pointless if you cannot say/pronounce the words. The microphone record button (press n hold) often stops during the recording which gets frustrating. If they fix the Cons, its definitely a 5 star app FYI its northern dialect.",
      "Now that I have tried premium I'd actually give a lower rating. What started out as a seemingly fun and great way to learn the language has its weaknesses: The order of lessons is very odd, e.g. numbers are the second last. Numbers also only go to 99, which is ridiculous considering the currency alone. Learning difficulty doesn't increase, i.e. when learning vocabulary you'll always see the answers, which makes remembering words even harder. Also the app still crashes when recording audio.",
      "Good learning app with visual guides, and I like the way it introduces things you haven't seen yet by process of elimination from things you have. Recommended.",
      "Mostly good. But \"chat bot\" ones don't read what is said correct. Things that sound completely different. Very irritating",
      "Love it. It would be great if they had different dialects for the same sentence!"

Lessons on verbs, nouns, adjectives and the differences in how they're used with past, present future, he, she, we, they. It gets confusing enough to want to quit. Also, the people speaking need to SLOW DOWN and enunciate!",
      "Very good app really helps me learning with the vocabulary of the Russian language the only thing I wish this have included was more help in terms of reading and writing the Russian language. Although I have not tried any of the more advanced levels of the app so I cannot comment if those levels include lessons on the cyrillic alphabet. Would be much nicer if it's have included lessons on the cyrillic alphabet because then it would be the perfect app and also included lessons on writing the lan",
      "It's okay. Needs some work. You don't actually learn much in the free version which is understandable because you want people to buy the pro version but they won't want to if the feel like they are not learning anything initially.",
      "Mondly lies somewhere inbetween fun and effective learning. It's presented in an easy to understand way. I recommend combining it with some dryer vocab learning and some more fun tv watching (with subs). No program I've found is all encompassing for language learning but mondly is definitely a good addition to your effort. Better for beginners than advanced.",
      "I find this method of language aquisition to be very easy to use the frequent email reminders are also particularly helpful. I seem to benefit from frequently being \"reminded to stick to a logical schedule. The jump from audio learning to actually being able to spell words in a totally alien characterset is handled very well by the lesson repetition encouraged by the countdown to next lesson availability couunter as it really encourages me to repeat previously completed lessons.welldone!"

      "It's been great so far teaching me the Japanese hirigana alphabet and the sounds each of the characters make. Each lesson is short and can be completed in about 5 minutes; I really appreciate the small portions! There's a section where you play a sound matching the characters you were just taught and they ask the English spelling of the sound when I think it would be better learning if it asked us to choose the correct hirigana character. I'm excited to start learning words and phrases soon! ^_^",
      "I love this app!! This actually lets you review the preview card when you get something wrong. It's completely 🆓️!! And when they show ads, it isnt watching a lame video that nobody cares about. You just look at a small picture and wait 1-2 seconds for the \"Continue\" button. I also love the little story that it gives! So kawaii! They even give pictures on each card! You can even learn any kind of Japanese! I strongly recommend this to people who are interested in learning Japanese!! 👁👄👁💙",
      "The name is true in all senses, and the app is absolutely free. I'm nearly finished with the first \"page\" of lessons and feel I can speak the language in an intermediate level with limited vocabulary. りこはすごいせんせいです。かわいい日本語もすごいせんせいです。There are times I struggled to learn the material but with the ways lessons are broken up, I can proudly say I was never lost. With everything that didn't make sense, I could always review the grammar rules in a panel. This is the way to learn Japanese.",
      "Like the others kind of game, Someone shouldn't learn language from one place. Overall, I like this app. Very effective, buuut, could you add more vocab, on the arcade ( Foxex vs Gangs and Nihongo Dash) since it is so really helpful for me about remembering stuff. That's all, dev. Assalamualaikum Warohmatullahi Wabarokatuh.",
      "Love this app .can learn at my own pace and level . Am suprised how much and how quickly things are sinking into my brain ,the way its set up is very good .will see in 6 months how good .🙂"

      "I really dont like this app. I liked it in the beginning when i didnt know how to read notes because I learned to play piano a different kind of way (simply music). Then I learned how to read notes and this is to beginner for me and wont let me learn more complex songs, which is my level. I can play songs like Ballade and this app is giving me Yankee Doodle to play. This is probably good for beginners just learning to play but NOT good for advanced players. After you can read notes its useless",
      "Very good app, I'm a very beginner so when I downloaded it, it was too hard for me because I didn't have the agility and I didn't know anything about the guitar playing. But now, I'm a lil' bit more trained so I can have fun with this app. You can go at YOUR level, at YOUR speed, and it helps me improve my skills. I love this app !",
      "I understand that this service needs to make money, however I spend most of my 10 free minutes a day redoing levels because the app will not pick up the sound. For now it also seems to be all fingerpicking, which does not help me with chords or strumming, something I feel would be more basic than fingerpicking. Overall I have found this app usefull to make sure I can build my finger strength.",
      "Good app, bad payment experience. Signed up for free trial, with the thought of cancelling before payment started. Double checked in Play Store that no subscription was running for this app. But I apparently signed myself up for a year of monthly payments, without any way of cancelling them. This is not what I wanted; and it was not clear at all that this is what I signed up for. Edit: contacted customer support; they cancelled further monthly payments.",
      "Managing your subscription is a mess in addition to being way overpriced. Stop forcing people to contact you directly to manage it. Make it simple to manage straight from the App. Been playing a few years. The app definitely needs some work. It doesn't pick up the sounds coming from the guitar very well and that gets discouraging. Some of the practice games don't lay out instructions clearly. Free trial time runs out quick. Tuning in the App isn't accurate."

      "The app is great, it covers every aspect of the game and definitely has helped me to improve my chess, but there's a bug that has been really annoying and stops me from giving the 5 stars. When I am on the tactics exercises, I cannot see the answer, no matter what I do, the app just doesn't show me the right moves, and some of the tactics are really hard, please fix this bug!",
      "Crashes pretty often. Some of the puzzle solutions are incorrect or incomplete, for example I just played a discovered attack puzzle where it wanted me to make a move to take the queen, but playing to another square was a discovered double attack on the king for mate. Another example, I just played a motif where both choices were part of the solution! It was a backrank mate, made possible by a discovered attack! Also too much of the content is pay walled. I'd recommend LiChess instead.",
      "Lost my money. I subscribed to the monthly premium subscription of this app. During the free trial, my phone broke and i had to change it. In the new phone, I installed this app and looged in. And there is no trace of my subscription. I was charged for monthly subscription without getting premium content. I contacted cuatomer support and they told me to uninstall-reinstall, logout-login sort of nonsense. Come on, it's 2020 and you are telling me to turn it off and on again! Stay away!",
      "Very nice to improve your chess skills and tactical strategies.",
      "After my last review. I was contacted by customer support and this time, they completely resolved my problem. They were very nice and courteous and explained the app has a small bug that they are patching. They issued me a full refund for the time I couldn't use the app and now I'm able to access premium features. The app itself is extremely useful. From using Magnus Trainer alone, my chess has improved a lot. Magnus Trainer is far more engaging than any chess book you can find on the market"

      "I usually don't write reviews but man has this experience been frustrating! I signed up for ABCmouse due to the corona virus to get the kids learning something while they're at home quarantining and it has been a nightmare! The main issue is that the app consistently freezes. No matter what! I have to close the app and reopen to get it working again and then sure enough, they tap on something and... You guessed it. Frozen again! Not sure if you understand exactly how frustrating it is to have a 3 and a 5 year coming to you every 5 minutes screaming \"It's not working again!\" especially when you yourself are working from home or in a meeting. I'm definitely not continuing my subscription and would advise anybody else to look elsewhere until they get some solid developers on their app.",
      "I didn't even use my free trial. I have a strong internet connection and brand new galaxy s10 that has more than enough memory and ram and I can never get the app to load unless its 15 to 20 minutes between screens. I have a 4 year old and this wait time is just not working as a learning tool. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. I will not reccomend it to anyone.",
      "I've had this for awhile now. Haven't used in quite a few months (9 mo) . It automatically renewed which was no problem I just had to go on the site, sign in and cancel right? Well it wouldn't let me log in without putting my account information back in then had the nerve to charge me AGAIN!!! I've been trying for a week to get someone on the phone or email. With the state of the world today i can't afford to pay or lose $50.99 let alone $130 for a site I can't use for one child!!!",
      "I can't even tell you my experience because it won't work on our tablet or my phone. I can log in but never get past that. All other apps work on both devices. Seems I'm not the only one having these issues. Neither devices are old so I don't know what's up. Just a poor app. Hopefully I can cancel it sometimeys soon and not get billed",
      "App freezes A LOT ! Or simply will not load . Should definitely make an update to it because it is VERY frustrating . Spent about $69 a year on this so my son could learn while I am working from home and he doesn't have access to my computer while I work so I figure this would be great for his tablet . It doesn't work on his tablet because it freezes or just simply won't load, so I put it on my phone and yup does the same thing . Looks like I am not the only one with this issue . Not happy."

      "I really like this app and I think it is a great learning tool. One thing I wish was better was its compatabilty with a chromebook. Its sizing doesn't really work, and trying to write with a mouse dosen't really work. But I guess thats my fault for not using it for its intended purpose since other wise its great.",
      "It is way too sensitive when drawing Hanzi characters. There also needs to be an order to the different ways that it helps you draw the characters. I shouldn't go from the hardest where there are few cues to the easiest when I got the hardest one right. Finally, it isn't very fun to draw the same characters 3 - 4 times in a row when I am getting them right each time. I love Drops in general and have used it for many other languages and recommended it to family, friends and complete strangers.",
      "I am from Ukraine and I started Japanese Kana scripts. It's amazing to have and have not hints while you drawing scripts with your own finger. App warns you when you make a line a bit longer or shorter or in wrong direction. Keep on learning))) let's see how it goes.",
      "Very nicely done ... would like to recommend some extras though as follows: (1) translation added in the review section, (2) way to re-organize characters in the review section for sake of easier memorization, (3) explain context or whether multiple meanings apply, & (4) historical/cultral notes would be cool (give extra meaning making it more memorable), not necessary though. EDIT: If I were really greedy, I would also recommend adding cross view of scripts in relation to Japanese, etc. Thanks",
      "This is agood app for learning to write Chinese, Japanese, and Devanagari but does not teach any of the other alphabets very well (I haven't tried hangul). I am dissapointed in the fact that the app limits your time and uses the adds and loading time as part of your limit."

      "It's a great app! Completely offline and their principle of \"Learn phrases. Not words.\" really got my attention. Audio clips are also offline so that further sweetens the deal. My only suggestion is that the developers add a male-voice over. That would make the app perfect!!!",
      "Speaks a little fast but other than that it works great. Does what it suppose to. I like it.",
      "You have to touch every single one you want to listen to. There is no option for creating playlist or continuously playing while you're doing other tasks. I think this is the point of learning on your device is that you can be free to do other things while listening, correct?",
      "Really good app. It helps me alot and it's also fun. The best part is its offline.",
      "Dont get me wrong, its a good app in all but its just hard to understand what the person is saying because the person is saying it so fast. A recommendation i have for the app is maybe you should let us search up individual words on the app as well as teaching us individual words such as, the, as, why, etc one reason is that in most languages the word the could be said differently like Spanish they use different words for different genders even with English and German. Thank you for reading this."

I hope 'Learn Chinese Offline' can have some quiz like other apps.. I'm currently looking for other apps for the quizzes.. But this app is amazing.. Truly recommended!",
      "Useful.....we r having an increasing number of Chinese coming in Fiji....some know how to speak Enģlish..some know very little....while some pretend to not know English and it is frustrating to use sign languages....this app helps me to at least communicate with them and understand what they might b saying ..... The last thing I want is to b discussed in any of their loud conversations without knowledge.....thanx again....",
      "Some han yu pin yin for the Chinese words are incorrect, there's a diff between pin yin said by the speaker compared to the pin yin written under the words. Also, some words are wrong. I had to keep cross-referencing to the pleco app to make sure I was saying new vocab learnt correctly. Some translations were off , e.g. lacking in part of a crucial word that was not included in English translation. E.g. Under I feel sick category, \"I think it is broken\" . Good effort, can be improved",
      "I loved it from the first use! It makes me excited to learn more. If only you added more separate words as dictionnary. Yet it is wonderful application. I can learn Chinese everywhere!",
      "I love all the futures. One thing missing is the voice audio, if its added would make it more advanced. All in all, its still the best."

      "A little difficult for younger kids to use, especially if they don't read yet. The 'yay' is fun, but SERIOUSLY overdone! Even the kids tired of it. No option to silence it or turn the volume down on that. For the little kids who don't read yet, having them spell or make sentences is just awkward. Even school aged. Would like to get for all the kids, but too expensive to add. Dropped stars because they don't reward points for lessons completed more than 10 times.",
      "I received a message in the normal Mondly app saying that because I am premium I get full free access to this app, but after downloading the app and logging in with same user details on same phone I still cant use it without paying for premium. I contacted support with no reply. Either your system is broken or you are trying to make me pay twice. Neither option is good so... 1 star for this app. Oh and DONT tell me to send an email to android@. Fix the issue for me instead!",
      "I think the art and graphics are great. But the pictures make it way too easy so I'm not really learning.",
      "I purchased the yearly premium subscription for adults but its still asking me to pay for the children's version... it says there is no account for my email. 1 star. Update: mondly crew very responsive and helpful! 5 stars!",
      "I have the adult version and got this kids version for free. I've tried it out and it's similar to the adult version and seems like a pretty good app. However, after every lesson, you are presented with an add to purchase a monthly subscription. It would be very easy for my son to accidentally click one of the buttons and land me with a big bill. Frankly, I'd be afraid of letting him use it unsupervised. If you can adjust this so that it would be more difficult to make purchases, I'd give you 5."

      "Not productive. Even if you let it record your vocal range, even the easiest warm up exercise is outside that range. So is even the easiest training lesson (which you have to pay for). Also I didn't hit a single note anywhere near correctly in the most basic lesson and it gave me a score of 8/15 and a \"congratulations\" and a suggestion to go up to the next level lesson which is ridiculous and it offered zero feedback and zero advise about how to hit a note or get closer to a note. Complete waste",
      "It could be great but they missed the mark. The technology works well; seeing your pitch is useful. They need to allow the singer to tailor the exercises to their own vocal range. Many of the exercises are pitched too low or too high to sing. It's like it was written by people who don't understand the human voice. I see they released the first update in three years but it didn't fix the fundamental flaw.",
      "If I don't sing anything, the app \"plays\" the right notes on its own and I get a perfect score.",
      "It's a cool app, and I appreciate that it's free; however, the piano note plays separately from the detection, it plays after you were supposed to sing it. If the developers could fix this, that would be amazing 😁 I can understand how hard making an app like this would be, though.",
      "This would be a great app if we could \"SAVE\" our songs. We the app is updated again please add a \"SAVE\" option. It's important fit this type off app so we can compare our improvents."

      "This is the best language learning app I've used after trying about a dozen. It's fun to use. It has many ways of finding the things you want to learn with excessive repetition of things you don't want to focus on before unlocking the next lesson. You can study what you want when you want. I love the Innovative 101 language app!",
      "I really like the lesson organization. I especially like the focus on listening practice. Each lesson has a bit of vocab, grammar, and cultural background. On the other hand more than a few lessons have editting errors. Some voice actors are very hard to understand. E.g Some speak way too fast even during slow repetition while others speak in such a disjointed manner it's hard even for native speakers to understand what they're saying. No built-in support for flashcard review at present.",
      "The app isn't as in depth at the website, and it's arranged differently, it's a little confusing to switch between the two. But overall the lessons are very well thought out and helpful. They really help with the why and how where other app focus on memorization. The content is wonderful, but the app itself could integrate more features included on their site.",
      "The lessons are really well put together. They dont overload you (at least not in the beginner lessons) fun to listen to and great interaction with the listeners. Including the pdfs with extra content is also extremely helpful. Ive paid for premium. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars, is due to the app stopping audio for no apparent reason. I'll be listening to a lesson, and it will stop. I try to resume the audio and the app freezes. Just means I have to close and reopen again.",
      "Overall experience is excellent. And for absolute beginner it is a very good experience to learn a new language. Especially the method of teaching pronounciation basics. Because it is the most important part of learning any language. There is also a suggestion if you please add the subtitles in other languages also. So, a person can switch the subtitles for his/her native language and it will be easy for non english speakers to learn another desired language. Thanks"

      "As far as ear training goes, this app is great and is the best learning tool I've found. It's the one I always come back to no matter how many apps or websites I try. My only problem with it is that any time my number of correct answers on an exercise gets to 1000, the app completely deletes my progress. It happened again this morning. I had 990 something correct answers in chord ID, I go to do one round of questions, and then next thing I know I somehow only have 3 correct answers.",
      "This app is pretty tight, lots of exercises not just in notation but also ear training and rhythm. The only issue I've had with it so far is the absolute pitch trainer sometimes stops generating new notes and you have to restart the exercise, but really that is only a minor inconvenience. otherwise everything seems to run smoothly and it's a great tool to practice theory when you're without an instrument.",
      "So far this app has yet to fail at teaching me more about music. I've always been interested in music theory and this has a lot of informations and also allows you to practice your rhythmic abilities and there are many useful quizzes within the app. I bought all of the premium features for very cheap around Christmas time and that was greatly appreciated. An overal very useful app that can be used anytime, anywhere, to improve your musical abilities and understanding.",
      "Fantastic app in my opinion. It helps work out musicianship ear-skills in a very well rounded way. I've recommened it to other students, even teachers (choir, music theory, or the like), & recommend it for students @ various levels / of different music focuses 🎶 P.S. literally been using the free version and it offers so much already w/o having to spend outta pocket $, I find that very nice to the user as it makes the learning much more accessible (compared to other apps I've seen)",
      "I am a college student who couldn't afford singing lessons and always wanted to be good at singing. This app helped train my ears and voice in a way nothing else I tried could. All my colleagues and friends who hear me sing now are always impressed which is what I wanted. Thanks Perfect Ear!"

However, Pinyin is not simply added to every character, but only where you need it - the app keeps track of the characters you know. Pinyin can be turned on or off for a character simply by tapping it.\r\n\r\nYou can read sentence by sentence, with a vocabulary list below the text, or Chinese text only with the vocabulary on a separate page. The vocabulary list shows only relevant vocab according to your skill level. Words you already know can be removed from the list, the app also keeps track of your known words and will not show known words in vocab lists again.\r\n\r\nA translation is available for each sentence - manual translations for our integrated texts, Google Translations for everything else.

(Sentence translations are a premium feature - however, as an introductory trial we offer them for free until the end of February 2018).\r\n\r\nYou can also listen to any text, high quality audio will be created via Google text-to-speech.

      "This app is really helpful. It allows me to learn new texts imported from anywhere, and since it learns quickly which vocab you already know, it's so good at creating a list of vocab that you probably do not know yet, then I focus specifically on those and can easily master any text, really cool and helps me a lot with my Mandarin! Thanks! :)",
      "Excellent app. There is really no better way to learn to read than flashcards within context of sentences. One weak point for me would be obfuscsting settings. Why can't I turn on and off dark mode while being inside a text? Would help a lot.",
      "Exactly what I was looking for. The import function (which is why I bought the app) is robust and extremely useful. The ability to mark up the characters you know, review flash cards and complete exercises just takes it to another level. The UI could do with an overhaul and there are a few small frustrations (being unable to access the chapter list for an imported doc, so you have to import multiple times, once for chapter one, again for chapter two etc.). But these are all minor issues.",
      "A fantastic app that really helps me to learn Mandarin. Reading and listening. The biggest frustration is that the sound simply does not work on an extremely frequent basis. This is an important aspect for my learning. But overall quite an amazing and comprehensive as an app. Update. Many months in I still have very frequent problems getting audio. Probably 50-70% of the time. Even using the 'alternative method of playing audio' option. Still one of the best apps.",
      "The premium version of this app is too expensive. However the concept behind this app is brilliant. It's a very useful tool for practicing your Chinese reading. It's a simple app in the way Linux is simple, so people expecting something more user friendly might be disappointed but it's almost exactly what I'm looking for. I would like a way of organising the texts I load into it, like folders or tag view."

      "Loving this app so far, what a brilliant idea! I have a suggestion..would love to be able to add images to the flashcards so that primary language can be avoided when possible. Using your native language teaches you to translate which is not the goal. This can be avoided by using images instead",
      "I decided to increase my rating to 4 star. I've found myself coming back to lingq as I really enjoy the running total of how many words you know, listening time etc. I truly believe you can go from 0 to fluent using lingq and I'm fully onboard with Steve's ideology. It loses one star as the interface is still quite clunky and there are still a few bugs.",
      "I could easily spend hours reading and listening to the material. I'm now finding vocabulary I've learned in a context with newer words where I can hear it. The reading isn't overwhelming so you can do some extensive reading and absorb more of the language.",
      "There is no better way to learn a language (truly) than by using LingQ. I have recommended it to so many people over the years, and if you are willing to give it am honest shot, than you will be surprised by the progress you can make.",
      "love the app, and the idea 🙂. One suggestion please is to make the pause button in the center and big enough . As a user I rely on it a lot and most of times I miss it in that corner. Thanks!"

Not cool & our company is losing money from inactivity since switching to this app & waiting for go.learn to fix the bugs.",
      "This app sucks balls, couldn't even get past the first screen. First, you can't paste the URL into the address bar. Then, it doesn't find the (long ass, btw) url you have to type in. Well, isn't that just glorious?",
      "Worked fine 1 time now just tells me there is no internet connection.....when there is",
      "Wasted my time downloading, signing in and course not being available for mobile",
      "\"No URL found, check it out\" again and again. No help tab."

      "I love this Learning Upgrade app it is excellent practice for my Students! We love the songs, they really help them to retain their times table vocabulary etc it's a real fun way to learn awesome keep up the good work!!!",
      "Have used this on Windows 10 laptops, a Mac Computer, iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire 7 tablet - works well on the iOS devices, but not well on the Kindle Fire 7 - I wish it did, as I love the Fire - but often the video gets out of sync with the sound.  My students love it - and I have 5 on it right now on Windows 10 laptops - no syncing problems at all.  When one logs out, there seems to be a 3 or 4 or 5 minute delay before that student can log in again, to the same account.  A bit of a problem when the Kindle would log me out for some unknown reason a bunch of times.  We did get through all the lessons on the Fire and only found one that didn't work -  and we get to try this for free for another year.  A great step in the right direction for apps for adult literacy.  Wish that it worked on the inexpensive FIre 7.  I will purchase a Fire 8 and see if the increased memory solves the syncing and logging out issues.",
      "This app is extremely slow for my Android phone 😡 You seriously need to develop a faster version, not to mention re-license the laptop version for New York City public libraries .",
      "don't works, I have Samsung S9 but when I need to write the app doesn't send the info to open the keyboard",
      "not workable on certain devices"
