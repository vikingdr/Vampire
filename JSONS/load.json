      "UPDATE: A year down the line and this is still THE best loadshedding app hands down! And it has only been getting better and better. Thank you guys for this amazing app! Feb 2019: I find this app EXCEPTIONLY useful. always accurate. I always know what's happening with Eskom and if it will affect me. Can also see what the planned outages are for days so I can plan. I cannot recommend this app more! Try it. If you don't like it, delete it (you will like it though)",
      "Very good and useful app. I have no complaints. One thing I've noticed which don't work on my phone is the Notification status ringtone, I saved a different sound, but when a notification arrive the app makes my default notification sound.",
      "This app is never up to date before the load shedding shift you are going to get. Untrustworthy in terms of preparing for load shedding sessions. Times are correct 2 oit of 10 times. Seems like you guys don't learn. The point of this app is to update users. Not to tell them semthing that they already know 10 minutes adter is happens. You need to notify users beforehand. My schedule always gets switched the second the loadshedding starts. Like now, from stage 2 to 4 as it turns off. \"Amazing\"",
      "Simple and usually accurate. One star originally deducted because the Eskom tweets display was showing ones from October 15 and 16 even after reinstalling; five stars now due to improvements and as the Twitter integration seems to have been fixed, as has an issue whereby on the Light theme area search results showed as white on white.",
      "This app is so complicated and confusing not straight forward. Please give us the exact info the app says load shedding is currently on stage 4 and gives two different times stage (3) 19:00 to 21:30 and stage (4) 21:00 to 11:30 how are we suppose to know which one to follow because I was following the one in-line with stage 4 but lights went off at 19:00 which is in line with stage 3. Tomorrow I get 6 different times of load shedding so now I'm supposed to guess which one is the correct one"

      "This used to be a good load board before the malware issue. Updated today. Now app doesnt work again nor does my laptop let me log in. This is an expensive load board with serious technical issues as of late. I have DAT as well, much cheaper, pretty much the same loads and 1/3 the price. Seriously considering dumping this load board. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!",
      "Worst load board app in the market , prices increase without notice and the insanely worst part is their servers crash during peak business hours and the app becomes useless i.e the consumer is paying for services that don't work when it's time for business , so literally compared to this app you could buy donkey poop and use it for fertilizer and get more value for your money",
      "New update made it worse. Constant error messages. Still no max length filter. They added a \"book it now\" button, but no brokers use it so that's pointless. How about adding features we could actually use? DAT has an \"along my route\" search feature, which would be nice to see on here. But apparently, the app isn't a priority",
      "I used to like this one a lot now I'm telling ppl to use other load boards. If my wife is looking for runs for me and gets busy at work and I log in on the road it don't kick her off and let me look anymore instead they thought it would be a great idea to make her have to log out..then I have to log in and if I'm driving again and for get to log out.... she can't look.... super dumb set up now it was a great load board :( if this changes I'll del this and put it at 5 stars",
      "Please create a pop alert for loads. The page should refresh automatically. I use truck stop daily and make a lot of money using it. The web application is a millions time better and the mobile app can be just as good. But the mobile app is more convenient."

      "It is a good time passing game. But it has a several drawbacks like rolling of the dice is not fair secondly at the end if the two players are not together it will make them together and make a tie then one wins which is quite frastating so it is not based on luck or any kind of stratagy but simply depends on the game. It does not allow fair play. Also it gives too much ads.",
      "Ever since the latest-update, it's setting the display-brightness to minimum. While I do love lower-brightness vis-à-vis an average, eyes-ruining gizmo user — but the sudden reduction in brightness even when the game is accidentally opened, particularly in an open-air surroundings: Is absolutely not-okay. Fix the darn bug pronto!",
      "There are many ludo controllers from which people are able to controll the dice and win each and every time... Not only in local multiplayer but there are also many ludo dice controller viruses(apk) from which always some common people are only winning... Plz fix this so that no one can control any game Plz fix that ASAP so that I can change my review to 5stars",
      "Hi developer.. Is this some kind of joke? What kind of program did you write? How can I lose all the time? And how is it possible for a particular opponent of mine to win 100 out of 100 times!! So many times I was about to win but miraculoiusly that person wins!!! Consider rewriting your program..",
      "No logic. Fun and interest loses when you get to know that dice roll is all computerized and prefixed. Sometime I get sick of it, dont get the six or the desired number most of the time. Waste of time.I have uninstalled it before and doing it again. Edit: Always show \"connecting to server\". And dosent load my earnings or any online game."

      "I thought the huge portion of the app is to eliminate check calls, but was I wrong. Went to bed at 3 am, got woken up at 0600. But when I ask why they made me install an app, they get upset & say they have a \" temporary problem \" with tracking. OVER A YEAR AT LEAST & still can't fix it ? I'd have it thrown away it was mine & unfixable. 2 stars only for pu / delivery info easily viewable on app.",
      "Not a fan. I don't need an app eating data using my location services, certainly do not need notifications (using more data) every 15 minutes telling me where i am which is supposed to be used so i don't get phone calls yet still get long distance phone calls and texts for that matter from some random operator in an office somewhere. It's unfortunate our industry has surrendered to the low percentage of \"truck drivers\" that don't know how to do their job professionally that we require and app.",
      "Easy to use reduce calls = nobody to wake you up . Easy to book loads and to call brokers, to put offers in or bid. Overall a simple decent app",
      "TQL is optimal with driver focuses in mind. They don't interfere as the rest Do. Thank you TQL. Nice working with your crew. Impressed, GC.",
      "This continuous violation of driver's privacy is outright disgusting. Broker's are not tracking the vehicles. They are tracking drivers. They do not pay for the data associated with what their apps uses, and nor do they have justifiable cause for this extreme violation of drivers privacy. They claim they won't call if the app is installed, yet they still do. They can't even provide their contact number correctly."

A Facebook group gave me a suggestion to clear the cashe, delete and reinstall the app...did that 3 times and still nothing. Sent a polite email to the owner of the app, and still no reply.

      "App is useless. Wasted two days trying to do a load transfer. Registering needed the whole process to be repeated 3 times. Then the credit cards fail to register. Just fail, no info given. I did a WU transfer to get finally balance. Then the load transfer failed. Again, no info given. Oh and the support will ALWAYS reply with the same canned response regardless of your issue. Useless.",
      "i am 1000000% dissatisfied with this app and it's verification process. I get the same feedback when providing valid passport and information every time. 'Make sure the information is correct' and I do. Just rejection after rejection. I just want to use my paypal account on Lazada and catch some good deals. I am abroad. I even had to buy a pre-validated roaming sim. but still there is another blocker behind it.",
      "Before, it is useful. But now after i updated this app. I cant use send money at all. I hate to say this but its really bad. I almost tried sending to another gcash user there is a pop up box saying \"Sorry yor current transaction cannot push through\" . Almost every hour i tried sending , still same responce im getting. Can somebody fix this. My money is stock in your app.",
      "Before it's a five star rating for me! Easy to use. It really helps me to save time, when paying my monthly bills, shopping and buying loads. But now i can't use my Gcredit to pay, though i pay on time! Not helpful anymore 😒.. every time you are going to have a system maintenance.. I have to complain in support.. NOT WORKING AGAIN! It's been a month since the last update of Gcash. since then i haven't use the Gcredit.. It became worst 😂",
      "There are monthly or annually limits in how much money you can transfer in or transfer out to CIMB. The error message that pops up doesn't tell you how much that limit is, or how much you have remaining. How am I supposed to know how much I can input? Edit: The developer replied but wasn't able to address my concern. My rating of 1 star stands. Very disappointed in this service. Do not recommend at all. Edit: tried paying today. Temporarily not available... If I could give 0 stars I would"

      "Possibly the worst app for tracking. Doesn't want to work most of the time and fairly archaic. Didn't use the other features so I don't know about them but I do know any time I tried to send a message through it, it started bouncing and flickering. Constantly kept telling me to restart tracking via text messages. I never turned it off, so...",
      "For some reason they will not stop sending me messages to open the app while I'm running a load. Throughout my last trip I was getting one every hour or more for three days. My app was open I was tracking just like their request. But the alerts keep coming. Even when I'm trying to sleep. Just today alone in 600 miles I received 19 messages. And of course I will get more throughout the night unless I delete this thing.",
      "Complaint I have is it's a distraction which I ignore while driving. It sends constant notifications to update. Other apps I've had to use ping your location and as long as you have GPS locator on updates itself. In this day and age of over regulation, everyone screaming about safety, hands free, no texting, which I agree with the latter three. The developers of this app did a piss poor job. By it's constant barrage of notifications it encourages distraction and should cease. Doubt anyone cares",
      "Every time a broker uses this app and I activate it for the load tracking. I get four to five messages a day to reactivate it because it's lost signal I have used other apps in the past like macropoint that I don't have that problem with they really need to fix their app.",
      "Constantly having to restart due to \"unexpected\" failures. This morning, I went on to make sure that I was being tracked and it said that the load was gone? I haven't delivered it so??? Complete waste of data space."

    "title":"AxleLoad - determination of truck axle loads",
    "description":"Why application:\r\n- avoid penalties for overloading axles by calculating the load on the axles. Do not lose the client, do not give a lot of money;\r\n- help the consignor to immediately arrange the cargo correctly before loading - no need to move the cargo after loading, this will irritate the consignor;\r\n- load more without fear of overload - you can earn more;\r\n- assess what the loads will be on the axles if you raise the sloth or the axle on the semi-trailer. Save on rubber or on fines.\r\n\r\nRecommendations for working with the application:\r\n- more accurately measure the car (dimensions and weight along the axes of an empty truck) - more precisely it will coincide with real life;\r\n- check the serviceability of the suspension and check the tire pressure;\r\n- if you think that there is excess weight (wheels, fuel, pallets, tools, snow), add weight to the characteristics of the truck.\r\n\r\nEnlarge the load:\r\n- if the goods are more than 50, then the program will slow down or even fly out. This is not correct, nothing can be done\r\n- it will be more convenient to move the load in the truck.\r\n\r\nAny cargo can be represented in the form of four types of geometric shapes:\r\n- pallets of standard sizes without hanging cargo - standard parallelepipeds;\r\n- pipes, rolls of paper or metal, cable reels ... - horizontal cylinders;\r\n- barrels, concrete rings ... - vertical cylinders;\r\n- non-standard pallets, equipment in boxes, etc. - parallelepipeds of any size.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of cars do not have:\r\n- container ships - will be.\r\n- bonnet singles - will be.\r\n- four-axle singles and four-axle semi-trailers - we can not make a calculation formula. If you know how to count and want such machines to appear in the application - write in the feedback form.\r\n- dump trucks - there are wonderful calculations for them (link). Dump trucks - a wonderful free calculator already exists https://samosval.info/katalog-transporta/peregruz.php#KALKUL\r\n\r\nWhy the calculation in the application may not coincide with the load on the scales (text + illustration):\r\n- inaccurate measurements of the size of the truck. All in your hands. Check the data on the Internet, or immediately take from there.\r\n- inaccurate data on the weight of the cargo (the weight in the documents does not coincide with the real weight). Consider the weight of the package.\r\n- inaccurate data on the weight of the truck: more / less fuel (+/- 500 kg), excess spare wheel (up to 150 kg), tools (up to 50 kg), pallets (14 kg per pallet), sticking snow (up to 2000 kg) .\r\n- failure of the suspension (lowers the cushion, spring broke) leads to the transfer of the weight of the load from the faulty axis to the rest.\r\n- unequal tire pressure. On the trailer axle with more pressure in the tires, the load will be greater than on the neighboring ones.\r\n- scales are guilty: uneven ground or malicious intent, alas.",

Do not lose the client, do not give a lot of money;<br>- help the consignor to immediately arrange the cargo correctly before loading - no need to move the cargo after loading, this will irritate the consignor;<br>- load more without fear of overload - you can earn more;<br>- assess what the loads will be on the axles if you raise the sloth or the axle on the semi-trailer. Save on rubber or on fines.<br><br>Recommendations for working with the application:<br>- more accurately measure the car (dimensions and weight along the axes of an empty truck) - more precisely it will coincide with real life;<br>- check the serviceability of the suspension and check the tire pressure;<br>- if you think that there is excess weight (wheels, fuel, pallets, tools, snow), add weight to the characteristics of the truck.<br><br>Enlarge the load:<br>- if the goods are more than 50, then the program will slow down or even fly out. This is not correct, nothing can be done<br>- it will be more convenient to move the load in the truck.<br><br>Any cargo can be represented in the form of four types of geometric shapes:<br>- pallets of standard sizes without hanging cargo - standard parallelepipeds;<br>- pipes, rolls of paper or metal, cable reels ... - horizontal cylinders;<br>- barrels, concrete rings ... - vertical cylinders;<br>- non-standard pallets, equipment in boxes, etc. - parallelepipeds of any size.<br><br>What kind of cars do not have:<br>- container ships - will be.<br>- bonnet singles - will be.<br>- four-axle singles and four-axle semi-trailers - we can not make a calculation formula. If you know how to count and want such machines to appear in the application - write in the feedback form.<br>- dump trucks - there are wonderful calculations for them (link). Dump trucks - a wonderful free calculator already exists https://samosval.info/katalog-transporta/peregruz.php#KALKUL<br><br>Why the calculation in the application may not coincide with the load on the scales (text + illustration):<br>- inaccurate measurements of the size of the truck. All in your hands. Check the data on the Internet, or immediately take from there.<br>- inaccurate data on the weight of the cargo (the weight in the documents does not coincide with the real weight). Consider the weight of the package.<br>- inaccurate data on the weight of the truck: more / less fuel (+/- 500 kg), excess spare wheel (up to 150 kg), tools (up to 50 kg), pallets (14 kg per pallet), sticking snow (up to 2000 kg) .<br>- failure of the suspension (lowers the cushion, spring broke) leads to the transfer of the weight of the load from the faulty axis to the rest.<br>- unequal tire pressure. On the trailer axle with more pressure in the tires, the load will be greater than on the neighboring ones.<br>- scales are guilty: uneven ground or malicious intent, alas.",

      "The app is robust and user-friendly. The free version gives a good picture of the situation, but for a small contribution this becomes even more interesting. The multiple packages that you create in terms of center of gravity give a more accurate picture of your weight on the axes. Are the results correct? After having had a roadside check there is data for comparison and more accurate input of data regarding loading weights. This app is fairly correct in its end results. I have doubts about the 3rd axle accuracy, but is acceptable due the fact that my truck anticipate weight pressure on his wheels Four stars as it give me more insight into the real live situation",

      "So it downloaded after I downloaded the other app... This seems redundant. Ill give 3 stars now cause you are able to send and receive WU with the app and card but it's still got net spend fees and Ive not had good experiences with them. Ill be deleting after funds are gone. The fees are incredible, you spend an incredible amount in fees. The other option is spending nearly $10 a month, if you plan to use the card for anything other than online shopping, then thats the route you'll want to take",

      "One of the best apps I've ever downloaded. Very useful for financial transactions. Purchases using the app and the Mastercard is an ease. Transfering and receiving money is very fast. And, the transaction history is pretty helpful! I just hope that partnership with BDO (in terms of being able to load paymaya using the app) gets back soon.",
      "Just randomly blocked my virtual card which still had more than 16 months left before it was supposed to expire. Tried contacting their FB customer service to inquire, but was just promptly ignored. I'll try giving them a few days to restore my account, or else I'll just use my remaining funds to purchase something, delete their app, and move on to Globe's GCash. Really disappointing since I've been using this service for years now.",
      "Very helpful and no maintaining balance. Very convinient for students also now that our school can accept payments for tuitions through online by using paymaya. Also very convenient when you have to pay your bills specially now that most of the people around the world is under quarantine you can pay your dues at home.",
      "I changed my rating back to 5. They fixed my purchase in Google Play Store, and finally able to get it back. The customer service are working at all. It just takes a bunch of time to reply. EDIT: I'll take my words back. My card just got blocked without a single notice? NOW I CAN'T USE IT ANYMORE. For what reason did this happen? Seems like I'm not the only one having this issue.",
      "Used this app for years now without upgrading my account. And now paymaya suddenly blocks my online payment card number with remaining balance on it. I can only use it again if I upgrade my account which I cannot since I am still a student bearing only 1 Student ID, such a dissapointment, I am infuriated with what paymaya did. User advice, just use GCASH."

      "I have been with Netspend for 4 years. And for the most part been happy. But I gave 1 star due to my experience today. I got a bigger sized credit from a refund we got and all of a sudden I can't use my card or my account. Then we try to call it says the info we put in is wrong so we can't even talk to anyone. App and online pulls up and everything looks fine. This is a nightmare. All the money I have is in that account and I can't touch it. Thanks a lot! Hope ya'll get it fixed soon!",
      "Its a great app. Especially if use the flash pay . money is sent from one card to another instantly no charge but only to other cards whose bank that NetSpend supports. This card has saved me numerous times when I needed money transferred immediately to me. Customer service was excellent handling an issue with monthly fees",
      "I have to at least like this app since I use their prepaid card, but the \"Mobile Check Load\" is horrible. It's problem is that it's Autocapture doesn't capture at all. It complains that it's too dark to take a picture. Despite using a dark background, and trying to keep the phone still, and trying to find a light or nonshade to use to brighten the check, I usually have to manually take the picture. Why can't I manually take the picture to begin with? I could before the last update. Trying to use it today, I had to manually take the picture 13 times to get it accepted at all. Look, if I could afford Hollywood lighting to take a picture of a check, I probably wouldn't need a prepaid card, right? Ingo Money Inc. is very bad.",
      "I have been with netspend for almost 3 years but most recently I can't sign into the mobile app no matter what I do I have had the same username and password forever!!! It's really frustrating and disappointing at times... other then this recent issue it's great!! Hope netspend fixes this ASAP!!!!",
      "Just like other preload Visa's that can be used internationally. Except that sites will suddenly stop accepting and you gotta buy another one. They charge $1.50 a transaction unless u shell out $10 a month. They also have maintenance fees. I don't recommend unless no other choice. If u use with any frequency I'm sure your getting gouged in the long run."

      "I love this app! I have PCOS and a low GI diet was recommended. Using this helps me keep my symptoms in check by eating low GI and GL foods. I have just started but am hoping for good results and weight loss. Only thing I would recommend is the option to change kg to lbs and grams to ounces. Thanks so much for making this diet change so easy to track!",
      "This app is great! So helpful deciding what to eat. As a diabetic it is important to know the glycemic load of foods so having this resource at my fingertips is game changing. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was due to the units of measure. It would be nice if there were more options than ounces or grams. Cups, for example would be helpful.",
      "This app allows me to track my blood sugar and weight and graphs it out for me. I can calculate my meals and check the GI and GL of food. I wished it let me save meals because I am a creature of habit and eat the same thing over and over. After I explored a bit I found it easy to use and for 6.00 a year it is well worth the price for the added features.",
      "For managing blood sugar levels a proper evaluation the GL and potential insulin spikes is more beneficial than a generic GI estimate. The GL, NET CARBS, CARBS, FIBER are all features blocked until upgrading for the \"premium\" version of this app. For anyone managing type 2 diabetes, I found an alternative to this on the Carb Manager app. Be well ~",
      "The app is great, things work a lil different than am used to, but i will adapt. If it allowed 12/24hr for time this would be perfect(at least for me). Keep up the great work, Worth the $."

Before you can Cash Out, you now have to convert your crypto to PHP which will be counted as Cash In. When you reach your Cash In monthly limit, you can't Cash Out anymore eventhough you haven't reached your limit yet. 2. Buying load, etc. & paying bills will now affect your Cash In limits, because now it only accepts payment from PHP wallet, therefore violating the rules you've set.",

    "description":"Glyx is a user friendly database displaying nutrition details for approximately 1000 various foods, focusing on the glycemic index, which are essential for low carb diets. Glycemic values are displayed by individual food in the summaries as well as on the detailed page for each food type, which also indicates the glycemic index. The Glyx diet is similar with the Montignac und Logi methods, which also are part of the family of low calorie diets. This app also assists diabetics to configure an optimal diet.\r\n\r\nA summary page enables a sorting order to display nutritional values, or alternatively vitamin or mineral contents, as desired. The app can thus be used to identify foods to counteract symptoms of deficiency in nutrition. To facilitate the search, the various foods are grouped into categories, with individual buttons for direct access. The search function works either for all foods or within each category. Upon selection of an individual food, the list shows the nutrition facts and facilitates the calculation of the various values with individual quantities, as entered on top of the page next to amount.\r\n\r\nThe supported nutrients are: Energy, protein, alcohol, water, carbohydrates, sugar, starch, fiber, fats (saturated, cholesterol, poly unsaturated, mono unsaturated), vitamins (A, carotene, B1, B2, B3, B5, B9, B12, D, E), sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, iodide, zinc.\r\n\r\nGlyx is currently available in 4 languages, English, German, French and Italian and supports metric as well as imperial measurement units.\r\n\r\nIn the pipeline for future versions:\r\n•\tAssembling various foods to piece together an entire meal.\r\n•\tTo save and share own menus with other users.\r\n•\tRate and ranking of menus\r\n•\tSearch for foods based on ingredients and nutritional values\r\n•\tCalculation of nutritional data for entire meals.\r\n•\tDirect comparison of foods\r\n\r\nGuiltyBits is made up of two software developers and Glyx is the result of their efforts in their spare time. Our vision ist the creation of user friendly apps with high functionality. Your feedback will be very much appreciated and any help to improve Glyx is welcomed.\r\n\r\nThe database is provided by the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office http://www.naehrwertdaten.ch/request?xml=MessageData&xml=MetaData&xsl=Start&lan=en&pageKey=Start",

      "I am changing my previous 2 star rating to 4 stars! The app has improved in leaps and bounds since I last rated it. So much more accurate and always available where I live but when I was on holiday in Hermanus, it did not pick up the area. I had to use another app for that area. I also like the inclusion of the coronavirus stats but it will help a lot more if it is updated daily.",
      "Fantastic! Easy to use. Accurate. Up to date. The best app to have diring these trying times! Could you add an optional alarm function that allows: (1) a setting to go off at a selected time prior to load shedding in your selected area. That way you dont forget to boil a kettle or cook food! (2)a setting to go off at a selected period just before outage end time. (Allows plugging back in of appliances, just after power restoration - helpfull for 10pm to 6am outages to Prevent spike damage)",
      "A really great app telling you what you need to know and when. Very accurate and it helps you to plan your day according to Eskom's mood swings. One thing that will earn this app 5 stars: a high level map showing the affected areas. That way you can plan your commute around the dead traffic lights. This will be really handy for people like me who have to travel through 5 areas on my way home.",
      "Interesting app. I'm german and I use this for checking the loadshedding times of friends. :) The times are shown in the south african time zones, though the \"currently loadshedding\" and \"no loadshedding\" displays are based on the time of the phone so this always an hour late because my time zone is an hour behind south africa. And what API is being used by the app to get the information, if any? I haven't found a good source yet.",
      "Hey Oaks! Love the App thanks for making it and letting us use it. One thought, when loadshedding happens, often some towers don't have battery backups, so no data - which means App just spins when you're loading your already added suburbs' schedules. Suggestion might be to use local storage to keep the last received schedule, stored in the app. When connected again, maybe do a call to see if the schedule is different? Also may mean less load on the servers."

So if i top up my love one number i can also send her a message (is okay if theres additional fees). Also could u make it auto top up for some period? Like i can auto top up my love one number for years for every end of the month? Coz im terminally ill and running out of time. Thank you dev team. All the best.",

The only problem is that you must use grams , and some things are better measured in tsp or tbs,which means you have to do some conversion...which,for me, means I have to go to my conversion cooking calculator to find how many grams to enter in this app to find my GL. Still, this is one of the easier apps I've come across and none of the apps has an exhaustive  food list.",
      "The basic data is good, and uncluttered by commercial versions of foods, unlike many similar apps. The UI definitely needs work though. As an example, if you search for food and then look at the detail of one resulting item there is no way to return to the search list, you have to search all over again! I would pay for the pro version if the UI was improved."

I've rechecked to make sure my email address is correct. Edit: finally got a code but they expire in 5 minutes and I got it 15 minutes after requesting. Trying 1 more time.",
      "It is a good card to have but since my account was upgraded to this new account and got a new card the places where I was able to load my card now I can't and they still have not made cards with chips in them yet and when you call customer services all you get is people that barley understand English what the F is this world coming to",
      "Great Banking service! They monitor your account for Fraud Protection and I so appreciate that! I also like getting my check early. The only complaint is I wish it would register like main banking I try to get loans etc and it's hard because it's pre paid even tho I have their all access account which is different. Other than that Brinks is a good Banking tool! Thanks Brinks for protecting me from frauds you caught a couple for me and locked my account! I appreciate that",
      "It's a card I can put my money on but I can't deposit checks or western union money order checks. Because theres no branch I can't even use an atm. I've only ever was able to do it once and it's been years since, aside from payroll direct deposits. Last time I tried to deposit a check their ingo thing they use deactivated my account. Never really understood the reasons considering I've had this account for years and have only ever used the app for it once."

      "Use to be a really helpful app. But now just nothing but advertisements. You have to be careful when selecting something on the screen, as you will hit one of the many ads and it will switch to your browser. Also when searching for specific truck stops or other stops, it will show places that are not in your search criteria. So I'm guessing these places pay to automatically show up on a search no matter what. And the worst part are hotels. It will show hotels that don't have truck parking.",
      "Overall it was a decent app. Now if you don't want Premium you'll get enough ad's to choke a Lit Lizard 3 times over! I think focusing on correcting the location directions (40% no exit #'s). Dump the ELD part, since there's already too many. And I wouldn't pay $10 or $30 a month for information I can find on a free app from the Truck stops apps. Or even Google if you search within a route it will locate a Travel center along your trip.",
      "Absolutely horrible. Was good. Now there are full screen ads. Ads that play video. This p.o.s. is trying to make me lose my license - playing video pop up ads! Close one then another and another come up. Ads are also taking up screen space on the map display. I had been using/contributing to this crowd source app for 3 years. Uninstalled today. The money grubbing p.o.s. has forgotten that people who freely contribute information made this app worth using.",
      "This USED TO BE my TO-GO APP, recommend it to everyone, NOT ANYMORE!! NOW this App has become inundated with useless, annoying ads that hijack your entire screen. If you want to open a rest stop to see details, it demands that you watch a video ad. It's USELESS TO ME NOW, time to find something else that actually helps me, and doesn't want me to pay to stop nuisance. Especially when the parking, and scale updates are provided by other users, which was the reason I USED TO LIKE THE APP.",
      "The app was reasonably convenient until the most recent update which has it jumping to ads including video and sound. Personally i dont think its worth paying for as the information it provides is available free from other sources and the addition of video adds really cuts back on the convenience. That being said if you dont mind the ads or are willing to pay for the app it works well enough."

      "Their support team is the worst. I'm a registered user for many months and have had to go through the verification process countless times because, although the app and website say I am fully verified, they apparently messed something up and I'm not, for some weird reason. They don't solve it, they simply stop responding... I've sent multiple tickets and they respond once or twice with pre-written stuff and then just ignore you. Very, very disappointed.",
      "I dont know why but for some reason the app will just flash but closes. I have no idea why? I have tried everything from unistalling to clearing cache, and force stop etc. This has never happened before. I called customer service and they said that it has too do with the API on coinbase but thay didn't work, so when i tried contacting them the person got mad, and asked me for my email 5 times, and my phone number over and over. Still not fixed when my wife downloaded the app she had no issues?",
      "Even after multiple attempts I never got the sms to confirm signup. They now have an email address, a phone number and a password. If I now move on to another wallet someone there might use that data to take over the new wallet I use. Not saying this will definitely happen but that is now possible where before it wasn't. Obviously I'll use another password but we all know some people won't. They deal with people's money and can't even get security right? Dangerous app. Stay away!",
      "Update: you advertise all sorts of free money if you sign up and learn about the different currency's. However, most are ended. And those still going out you on a wait list that can take years. How is this not false advertising? App works well enough. However, coinbase fees are high and it takes way to long to process a transaction. As in days!!! I am unable to do any trading due to pending transaction.",
      "The app is sub par and they have absolutely horrible support. I have opened three separate tickets with their support staff and my issue isn't even fixed yet. Every time I opened a new ticket they gave me some blanket response that does NOT resolve my issue. Then they close the ticket without checking if my issue was resolved. The worst experience I have had with any crypto company by far. If you aren't on coinbase pro they couldn't care less."

      "It's a great VPN, WHEN IT WORKS! More often than not in my experience it tries to connect to a server, rather than actually doing it... Sometimes its instant and I'm filled with glee, however, 90% of the time I'm relogging, trying different servers, and just hoping to SOMEDAY connect to one!! I've tried all alternative options in \"settings\" to no avail. This happens with the paid version, which is why I'm very dissapointed. DO NOT BUY; if you experience this as well through the free trail.",
      "NordVPN does not work with most streaming services. The company's position: \"accessibility to the streaming services is an extra feature and we do not guarantee that you will always be able to access it with no issues 24/7.\" Even though they advertise that they offer uninterrupted streaming. So you have to disconnect, then reconnect, every time you wish to stream. They will respond by saying you should contact customer service. 2 chats, 4 emails later (ID #5305367)no change. Time for a new VPN.",
      "Great VPN! If you are using on a Chromebook and you are using apps, then you need to install and activate the NordVPN app to be fully protected. There is a Chrome extension that protects the browser ONLY. It was easy to find the answer to this question on the FAQs by NordVPN. Some streaming services do not allow you to use their service (YouTube TV as of 3/2020) and NordVPN at the same time. Other apps that don't allow you to use NordVPN, also. I am concerned mostly about financial transactions.",
      "Not very user friendly, I had to figure out by myself and totally by chance that I have to use obfuscated connection to successfully connect without being blocked. There is no users' guide provided,would be cool though,with every scenario to troubleshoot.And it's not working on my android tv box, leaving me stuck to the 8\" tablet to watch movies. I'm not impressed. Tough luck that I got the 3 year subscription without testing the first year. The 3 stars would be for the price then.",
      "So far so good. Expressvpn has left me with a useless 6 month subscription in China. It just won't connect and is slow as a snail when it does once and hour. Nord connected quickly and is good so far. I wish I'd spent the money here first but I had good luck with the other last time. I'll keep both just in case now."

Because of that response, I moved it from 3 stars to 2 stars).",

They can't do anything right. A couple months after I listed the comments above I tried to request funds from somebody and instead venmo sent them funds putting my account in the negative. I can not warn you enough, so not use this app it's terrible.",
      "*update* Venmo solved my issue quickly. I appreciate their customer service and now I can use Venmo again! Woohoo!!* Tried to install the app but won't let me verify my phone number so I couldn't even get passed the registration part. Kept saying 404 error.",

More than one person should be able to use the same bank account, like a husband and wife with a shared account. 2 An option to verify the identify of the recepient - like sending a real-time ping or something. Last 4 digits of the phone number are okay, but wouldn't a real time ping verification be easier, especially for retail transactions?",

What I expect to happen is the keyboard to disappear. If I tap anywhere outside the keyboard disappears. When you have time would you please and add a \"X\" box. Thanks in advance. MICHAEL",
      "Me and my family loved the Roku, plenty of free shows, movies, reality TV, cartoons ECT. The bonus is the extra stuff you can subscribe to at a very low price. Turns out to be the cheapest non cable bill I'll ever have to pay and that's to get beneficial stuff! You know like recording, live television, and the best of the best of reality TV shows.",
      "This is one of my favorite apps. I always lose my remotes and the roku app always works perfectly from literally anywhere in my house. So For example if I am on my back porch I can press play and my kids show will start. It's also really cool that you can stream the roku channel on your device with the app. I'm still kicking myself for buying a replacement remote last year before I knew about this app. It's so easy to use my three-year-old uses it to control his TV. Don't change a thing!",
      "It's great when it works, the private listening feature is particularly useful and just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it's buggy as hell and does not work most of the time. With private listening on the audio will often lag and sputter so much that eventually my phone will disconnect from the tv. No problems with connectivity when private listening is off, but that feature is basically my only use for the app. Sometimes sputtering audio will keep playing long after the video's paused.",
      "If I could make use out of the private listening feature it would have been a 5 star rating for sure! I can't seem to figure out how to use it and if I even can use it in the way I hoped to use it. At night when my family is sleeping and I don't want to bother them with the TV volume too loud I thought that I could nix that problem with the private listening feature but doesn't seem to work that way. Without that 1 issue 5 stars would be there without question!😞"

      "I used to really love this game; absolutely adored it. I've been playing for over a year and am on level 1375 currently. Since the last couple updates (i'd guess since mid February), the game takes 4 solid minutes to load when I open it, and constantly freezes, forcing me to restart the app and wait those 4 minutes, over and over again. Yesterday I downloaded the most recent update, and now my game freezes only after a couple seconds of having it open. Sometimes it stays normal until I press a button, then it freezes. Please fix this! I love this game so much! I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Amp 2. Thank you for your time reading this.",
      "It's good to pass the time, but it doesn't take too long to notice that there are often very Christian words mixed into the puzzles, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think it should be advertised as so. It's just interesting to see what words the app decides are valid and invalid. I had to delete the app when \"ants\" wasn't an answer but \"sin\" was. Also, way too many ads of course.",
      "Good, not great. LOTS of words are used very frequently, not a lot of variety. Difficulty doesn't seem to advance (I am on level 200) and the number of ads is annoying. Like 1 every 90 seconds or once you finish a game if it takes you longer than 90 seconds. The ads repeat over and over and over and over and over... Same ads, same \"cannot wait for this to be over so I can get back to the basic challenge of the game\" irritation. No apparent way to just buy out of the ads.",
      "So the greed has finally caught up with PeopleFun! They're so money hungry that they have now started reducing game features to make way for ads. You can no longer see the extra words in the bottom left corner - it's now covered with a small banner ad. Besides this, the full screen ads are a lot more frequent now than they were before. Poor guys must be having financial difficulty. After having had this game for a long time, I will now be uninstalling. If it ain't broke, don't fix it you idiots!",
      "This game is cool. I like it, but my problem is that my coins dont go to the appropriate position. See the piggy bank gets full. Then after, I complete a level with only 20 coins I can use. I get one coin and the rest bounce off the piggy bank. The worst part is that you have to buy the piggy bank to get the coins that you have earned. That's not cool. I dont have the money spend on coins that I have EARNED while playing and completing levels. I can deal with the ads but it's a RIP OFF."

      "Previously didn't get free stuff as videos weren't working. Have noticed a few other reviews say the same. My Internet fine. OK so I've just done another update. I don't like what you've done with the spin wheel. After watching a video to get a free spin you MUST now spin the wheel before it will let you watch another video for a free spin. I liked to save my spins up for when I really needed them like during quests - spin the wheel 3 times. Or when getting puzzle pieces. Please change back.",
      "Major Glitches Lately Used to enjoy this game a lot but recently it doesnt give you the prizes you collect. Whenever it gives the option to watch a video the video won't play and you end up not getting the original prize. I've lost countless prize tokens needed to complete quests. I've tried to send feedback but that freezes every time. I've spent a lot of money on tokens which makes this even more disappointing.",
      "I have spent the time and $$ to get more coins only to b left wanting. I am not sure if my emails requesting this issue be resolved are even getting thru. So, basically, this game is a waste of my time. No attempts have been made on their part to fix the problem & that doesn't set well with me. Good luck to the rest of you.",
      "Would give zero stars right now. Major issues. Game will offer free items for watching videos but over 80% of the time it says \"video not ready\" so you end up with nothing. It will also offer double coins if you watch a video but when you click on the button it does nothing...no video...no extra coins. Loved this game at first but now just disappointed and frustrated with it. Have tried to send feedback through the game but it hangs up and says it us gathering state info and never goes through.",
      "I enjoy it a lot, however the game play is hit or miss. Lately, when the bonuses appear on the right side of the screen and you go to click on them, most of the time they don't work. And.... when it is clickable, I'm met the with the \"Video not teady\" error message. Very frustrating. Hopefully, this gets fixed with a future update."
