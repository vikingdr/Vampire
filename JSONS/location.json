There' a problem in the map screen though: the toggle for full screen mode sits on top of the compass that reorients North. It would also be nice if sharing were expanded beyond max 6 hours, and you could build groups of friends (instead of a link to be sent out), controlling groups location is shared with. Yeah, sounds like one of those other apps that charges a lot...",

    "description":"Change your GPS location using this simple app. Set a pin on the map using a long press (same as Google Maps), you can also double tap to zoom in/out on the map.\r\n\r\nWill also keep working if you reboot your phone. To turn it off just tap on the Stop button.\r\n\r\nThis tool is useful for apps and websites where you can change your location and explore new places or stop them from tracking your real location.\r\n\r\n* Now you can add multiple pins on the map and set an interval in seconds to change the location to each pin. Please note that in Android the interval will vary significantly when you turn off your screen/the device goes into sleep mode. To clear the pins, tap on Done and then long press on the map or search for a location to set a new single pin.\r\n\r\n* What is \"Mock locations\"? Mock locations is a hidden setting in Developer options in the Android operating system that allows a device owner to set any GPS location for testing purposes. To enable Developer options go to your device Settings - About and tap Build number 7 times. This may be different on some devices, in this case you have to search how to do it for your device. Please use caution by not changing other system settings.\r\n\r\n* Please note that this app does not change your IP address, this is not a VPN. Applications/websites that check your location based on your IP address may still detect your real location.\r\n\r\n* Now you can access the Android system Developer options from the menu in the lower right.\r\n\r\n* Now it works in Battery saving mode too (no GPS), so all Location modes work now. Update: due to some recent changes to Google Play services this may not work anymore.\r\n\r\n* Now it can work as a system app as well without needing to enable mock locations (this feature only works on Android Lollipop and below). Please search how to make it a system app as it can be different for each device. Also please note that this is a power user feature and we are not responsible if you cause any problems to your device in the process of making it a system app. Unless you want to run it as a system app or you run Android Marshmallow and above, you will need to enable mock locations on your device from Developer options for the app to work.\r\n\r\n* Please note: to disable mock locations on your device you will need to do it from Developer options. You normally do not need to disable it back, but some apps may not like it that you have it enabled, as they can detect this. The app does not change anything on your phone by itself, it simply asks you to go and enable mock locations and the Location in order for it to work and it is impossible for it to undo these changes as they have to be done manually. Also it is best to tap on the Stop button before you uninstall this app to get your real location back as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to rate it low, please tell us why, if there is a bug, we will fix it as soon as possible. Also if you want to cheat in a game and the game does not allow that, you do it at your own risk and we are not responsible for it.\r\n\r\nPlease use this app responsibly.",

      "I would rate it 5 stars, but one problem i have is that i cant search for the specific place. I live in singapore and evertime i try putting in the exact location and postal code, it says server response: request denied. Because of that, i have to manually search for the location by scrolling, which takes too much time. Apart from that, best fake gps app. 👍👍👍 would be appreciated if i could get some help on how to search for the location, thanks!!",
      "Still works great. It reads on startup that it wasnt designed for the current build of android OS, but it still works as expected. VPN services are often blocked by streaming providers and some require phone location for content availability. This app plus VPN have you running with ease. It's a shame that if you're traveling on business you cant use steaming tv services that you pay for. We are already away from family.. and they block you from watching NASCAR, baseball, etc too? Uncool.",
      "i dont know if this app is the cause of it but im pretty sure it did, because it happened right after i changed my location none of my apps open, none of the widgets, not the camera at my lockscreen, notifications are SUPER late, messages dont send, the app wont uninstall, this app can open and work occasionally and so does google assistant but thats it. i need a solution right now",
      "Works well, not perfect, some apps still find actual location even though app is running. Resetting location periodically helps. When opening app, map starts in random location in South America or Pacific Ocean even when app is already showing a lat long in the status bar; why won't map open showing position being used? Oh, and need to update for Android 10",
      "Works so good even Google doesn't know it's fake! I keep this app hidden by using the in app setting options: Don't show icon in status bar. Start when turning on. And randomly move. And then outside of the app I use the built in phone option to \"hide app\" in the app drawer. Which brings me to my only app suggestion. Option to hide app with dial code access. Because sometimes the people I don't want to know my whereabouts have access to my phone. Thanks and keep up the good work."

      "It was working fine but then I got a new phone (still an Android) and it kept telling me that my child had no network or phone was off, when it wasn't. I then deleted and re-downloaded yet again only to be told that an unknown error had occurred or to check connection. There is nothing wrong with my connection. Really disappointed.",
      "It used to work good, but the last week or so its been crashing and freezing and also refusing to alert me when people leave their locations. Presently its showing me inaccurate locations for people. Shows people several feet away from where they are actually located moving, when they are not actually moving. I have even seen my own icon moving around when I know for a fact I'm sitting in my home in one spot with my phone in my hand. I've checked all settings for my phone and their phones, I've done steps listed in the FAQ's. Of course some robotic response will respond to this and tell me its on my end (always blame the user) but I believe this is an app glitch.",
      "It used to let us know when either of us left or arrives at home, it no longer does. It doesn't update either of our locations unless we have the app open, we used to be able to open just to check where the other one was, we can't do that anymore. I emailed support and the instructions we were given have been no help.",
      "This used to be a good app, but from last update ..it's not working well...it shows me wrong readings about my family circle...and they have never been there...ever! And this happens every day now...so...I'm considering to delete the app. 3 months later...the same...no improvement...pls do something.",
      "Ever since the new update a few weeks ago my Life360 app and my son's app don't work at all. It always says that we are arriving and coming home at random times throughout the day. And it also is not accurate with the location at all. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it. I've tried turning on the Wi-Fi and turning off the Wi-Fi and then turning it back on I've turned off the location and then turned it back on. Nothing seems to work. I'm getting really sick of it."

      "It's good, wish it lasted longer than 15 minutes. Wish it lasted all day instead of just per checking point. Upgrade this to last longer than 15 minutes! That's not long enough to check on your kids or anything! You'd be sending alerts all day like a stalker annoying the kids or embarrassing people who don't want to be botherrd, but need accountability or have to be showing whereabouts at any given time",
      "Used to like this app, Not anymore. Anytime the screen times out, so does the Glympse. I am constantly requesting location from my kids when they are on the road on out of state trips to see how they're doing. How do they stay safe if they are driving, and have to send another location ??? The last cple of updates ruined it. ALSO, THERE IS NO WAY TO QUIT FOLLOWING! IT JUST KEEPS GOING IN THE BACKGROUND!",
      "It seems like almost everytime I share m my location or vice versa.. someone else shows their location... we have to send it two or three times asking for permission two or three times. I do know what I'm doing; I've had this app for a long time and believe it or not I have had it work for longer periods than not. But nevertheless, it is frustrating.",
      "Excellent app, no complaints thus far....! You can't text through the app, but you can share your location with more than one person at a time, which some people might consider a creation of a friends group, in a sense... Also, the different views- street/satellite/terrain and traffic overlay- make for a really awesome feature... I'm not sure if there are any similar apps like this one available, but if there are then they need to offer at least these many features as this app does...",
      "Been using for a year or so now, but latest couple of builds seem to have slipped in the basics - worst is app is like a zombie, you just cant kill it! (unless you use Android Force Stop grrr). Stop Sharing from notifications doesn't work, exit app doesn't - just sits in background eating battery... please fix, used to be good."

      "Used this to find a lost phone several times! The precision of it's a little confusing at times, and I'd love to see an implementation of a way to post a message to the lock screen of the phone while you're trying to locate it. (In case someone upstanding finds it and you'd like to post a number for them to contact or whatever.) Really great app, though.",
      "Your app was suggested to use to use my mobile device to find someone else's lost device. But no where on this app does it have an option to put in someone else's phone number in order to track it & find it. Obviously if I'm using my phone, I don't need to find it, duh!!! The only info this app gave me was that my phone is \"in your hand\"! Not sure what then is the use of your app!!",
      "Very nice for when I misplace one of my devices, I would give it 5 star but they recent removed a feature that I loved. Beforeyou could just lock the devices on your account. Which worked great cause I have two tablets on my account for my kids to use. When they would not get off their tablets, I could just lock them. Now if I secure them I have to relog in to google instead of just entering the password. Which happen multiple times a day",
      "Pretty reliable. Has helped me recover multiple phones on multiple occasions. Even without this app installed, as long as you have location services enabled on your lost phone, it usually can get you within at least a hundred yards of your phone. From there, you can enable the \"play sound\" feature which should get you the rest of the way. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because last time I used the app, the \"play sound\" feature didn't work on my Samsung J3 Orbit. Still found it tho",
      "app has not been working well for a while. Google apps track our every move, so why is it that when I want to see one of my device's location it says location not available. No matter what kind of structure I'm in, Google Maps is always able to at least guesstimate my location, so there's no reason why this app shouldn't be able to do the same."

Even though my location is on it stops tracking my progress. I need the maps EVERY day and I'm really bad at directions this is a huge problem for me. While reading the directions, thank you for back up plan, I still miss my turns often. Please help your loyal customers.",
      "The new update is horrible. I usually never give such worst star rating but I am forced to cause of the bad and mysterious roads this update has driven me through. The arrow doesn't move anywhere and it shows the longest possible way instead of easy ways. Worst app ever. Highly disappointing. If you improvise I will definitely change my ratings. Hoping for help and improvements.",
      "- Map is slow so i decided to remove places from want to go category - it is not possible to do it in batch and list always shows the same number of items as before I deleted anything... - there is too few options to customize map content. I want to save data but preview of places show me always many pictures with food etc... I do not want to browse pictures, I just want to see more info about a place like opening hours - offline map selection box is weird, i want to select custom box",
      "I use Google Maps on daily basis for work. I noticed a few weeks ago everytime I would use the app, it would freeze causing me to miss my turn or drive past my destination. At first I thought it was my phone (Note 8) as it has been acting up but then when I got my replacement phone, I noticed the same issues which eliminates the possibility that it was the phone(s) not working properly. There is something wrong with this app that causes it to constantly freeze on the Samsung Note 8 phone.",
      "Great. Has very precise location very good accuracy with how far the distances are from point A to point B I would rate this five-stars. You can use it for a GPS you can use it for many multi purposes and it is very helpful especially when you don't need don't know where you're going it will help you"

      "its one of the most annoying spps ive ever used. it keeps sending notifications about my own location. i press stop tracking my own phone nad it doesnt stop. I've tried to stop it anoot of times in less than a day and every time i move it starts tracking . needless to say , the adds are constant too. I'm deleting it . its not worth it .",
      "step1 download this app step2 open the app up and close a few popups step3 add a contact number you would like to track step4 send them a invitation step5 they have to accept the invitation and download the app Its been pretty accurate sometimes its slower and gives out the wrong spot use refresh it ussally in a few minutes it will correct itself I wish it could give an addresses of every location pick up a little more but am glad that I found it and its the one I decided to keep so far",
      "I can't get it to work. Its downloaded to wife's phone. And it's still tells me to invite her. And the same happens when she tries to locate me. I want to cancel my subscription. Tell me how. New update. This app started great. It's right on always. But the problem is that it stop tracking and I have to send another invitation for it to track again. I've emailed support and have been ignore. And I emailed the developer and nothing. If it wasn't for that. I'd say get. But don't waste your money",
      "I've just installed this up last night and somehow it works. However, I noticed that the location of my family member does not change since last night. The location should be in the school already and not in our house as my family brought their phones and simcards with them. Hope to receive a feedback from one of the app administrator.",
      "They advertise free which it's not true. Its misleading and I question the ethics of this app as to privacy rights. Which mean the provider also have the info they could sell to any one. It doesnt matter if you dont have any thing to hide. This is one of few freedoms we have including our private thoughts which to gov has a patent on as of this tex it's like mkultra which is under a different name since 1977 because of technology since then they can target any one and know what you are thinking"

Before purchasing the full version of the application check the performance on your device. For this purpose there is a free trial period of 24 hours after installing the app. During this time, you can use the premium features (Hide the application using \"Hide Mock Locations\", or move the app to the system partition and run without setting Allow mock location).

(The free version of the application, this function is available for 24 hours after installation.)\r\n\r\n\tTo do this you need to move the application to the system partition. This is most easily done by using \"System App Converter\" program.\r\n\t\r\n\tJust move the application to the system partition can be manually (Using Root Explorer):\r\n\tOn Android 2.3.3 - 4.3: move the file \"ru.gavrikov.mocklocations.apk\" from the folder \"/data/app\" in the folder \"/system/app\" and reboot the device.\r\n\tOn Android 4.4 - 4.4.4: move the file \"ru.gavrikov.mocklocations.apk\" from the folder \"/data/app\" in the folder in the folder \"/system/priv-app\" and reboot the device.\r\n\t\r\n\tEven you can hide Mock Locations app work on other applications (in this case they will not see what is on tick \"Allow mock locations\").

It works through the Xposed framework.\r\n\t\r\nThere are times when your jump coordinates to the actual location. This happens on some devices after the application was transferred to the system partition.\r\n First solution: \r\nIn the setting of the device to enter in Location tab and turn off location for wireless networks.

Periodic Lee I have to physically open the app in order to reset it, it would be nice if it notified me when it needed to be reset or if it just didn't need to be reset. I will periodical I get a text from my wife telling me that my family locator is offline again. All I have to do to fix this is open it and close it and then it stay is good for quite some time.",
      "Was acceptable for £9.99 annually even though it was flaky at times. Just re-subscribed for another year automatically took my £9.99 only to find that it does not give me full version anymore as it's gone up to £54.99 every 3 months???? Nice of them to let me know!!!! So £9.99 out of pocket. £219.96 Annually it's a joke. Have unsubscribed and deleted!!!!! Use Google share location it's free & more reliable.",

Still using this App for years, I hope I can add more safe/danger circle to the map. And add more (dangerous/hated/blocked) people to the map so I can avoiding them anywhere.",

      "Used to be amazing when we first used this a good few years ago but it's so poorly optimised for android. Location cannot be accessed unless the app is open and is being actively used making it pretty pointless. It's a shame because the emojis and messaging is super fun and when it works it's very accurate.",
      "When it works, this is a great app. I can see an estimate of how long it will take my family members to get home, which is great for planning meals or getting ready to go somewhere together. Unfortunately, it seems to be happening more and more often that the app doesn't update our locations, and it says we are somewhere where we are not. It kind of defeats the whole purpose of the app.",
      "Great App, but since I've moved to Android 10 I cant allow Zenly to allow location access to this app 'Always', meaning my family can't track me. No support articles to fix this. Im going to have to find another app 😒",
      "Excellent app however my phone will only allow location access to Zenly only if I'm using the app. So to everyone else it looks like as if I have frozen my location. Would be nice to see this being fixed OnePlus 7 Pro.",
      "Love this app it's so funny to use. One comment! Allow people to see you even if they are not your friend. I would like to follow famous people like on Twitter and casually see them pop in on my map. \"Ha drake is at the Raptor game! \""

Just like most other apps alike, it is a waste of time and probably will never work as we are told its intended. Then there are the ads that pay for this app and allow this POS app to be free to us. Even tho they do work as intended, they are so outdated as far as their capability to get us real time information. I'd give 0 stars if possible. Waist of time.",

I have yet to get one piece of useable infomation from the app. Nothing that is remotely close to a gps location has resulted from hours of my time in an attempt to access such information.",

Besides the irritating ads that pop up while trying to find a location and knocking you back to earlier point and most frustrating once you find area and click to get address location the message from hell appears \"ERROR\" no matter where you click. Only installed a half hour ago and now I will fix the \"ERROR\" message to read \"DELETED\". Problem solved. Besides Google Maps is more superior and no ads.",

      "Downloaded this app mainly to be able to use the joystick after it being recommended to me as a free app. Disappointed to find you have to pay $3.99 to enable to the joystick. Definitely cant see paying for a feature that I cant test to see if it does what I need it to do. Personally the app isnt for me if theres not at least a trial to test the features before you buy.",
      "It says mock locations are disabled, but doesn't give any instructions for how to do so. The youtube video shows a pop up that goes to settings that allow for the app to work. This app does not have that. It pretty much just tells me the app won't work bc false locations are disabled or it's not the default. I can't use the app at all.",
      "As a free app with ads this works fine. BE WARNED: The paid version of THIS app (paid version without joystick) DOES NOT WORK ON ANDROID 10! (Hence why I gave it a 2 out of 5 rating.) I don't know about the paid version with joystick as I only paid for the version WITHOUT joystick and that DOES NOT WORK ON ANDROID 10. Since I paid for the app you decided to not make compatible with Android 10, will that purchase allow me to use the paid joystick version that does work with Android 10?",
      "It doesn't work with many applications because Google had changed some services two weeks ago. I informed technical support of this app regarding this matter, but they offered me to install virtual machine on my smartphone to fix they big !!! I can't believe ! Dear support, are in serious? You have to fix your app or get it out of Google play as far it doesn't work !!!",
      "Super app. Excellent work. This app is not a Fake. Super working. This app is amazing work Whitout rooting. and while doveloper option is not on. And also trace Governament app's gps. It's realy very help full."

      "Terrible. They haven't tested this. DOES NOT WORK in Mexico (Cancun). Takes over message app. Useless. Friend attempting to share location: his phone sent a text message with a link. When I accessed the link, after I had downloaded the app, it launched, but showed a very close up shot of his position. Zooming out did not stick, it snapped back to closeup. If I left the app display, I had to re-launch via the link Messages. The position never moved. Whenever my friend texted me, if I could only see his text by exiting My Location. Even if this works as I assume you intended, it is much cludgier than Google Maps. I still don't understand how it is supposed to work, which is a problem.",

      "This is my experience. The gratis model is rather generous for a party of two. I have not encountered hardship. While I cannot compared to competing apps, I witnessed this much to be true: This app functions as indicated and has exceptionally useful features. My qualms - the only, and tiny - are that a manual refresh can be required upon selecting an individual and that location can lag by, say, not more than 30 seconds on some occasions. To sum, this is a spectacular piece of technology.",
      "Problem: I installed this app on 2 devices and turned off location sharing on 1 of them. Now even though I set the location sharing feature to ON, location sharing doesn't work and others in my circle cannot see my location updates. I have signed out of the app, deleted it and cleared both device's cache, then reinstalled the app several times to no avail. Clearly a bug that must be addressed. Fix: I changed my phone language from English to Ukrainian and discovered that the location sharing problem fixed itself. It continues to work after I switched the phone language back to English.",
      "I love the app as it functions but I paid $24.00 to purchase the premium version. I am offended that I am still getting adds popping up after paying so much. I understand ads on the free version but this is obnoxious. The ability to look up my own history of where I drove and when I was at various locations is very useful. Lose the ads on the premium version I would rate this a score of 10 out of 5! (yes, those are the numbers I mean).",
      "Put this app through a week test run with 4 devices to see whether it would be suitable for use at Dinsey World tracking family etc.. Well I'd have better luck with 2 cups and a string. Great concept for an app... when it works. Worked for 10mins before popping up asking for subscription and incorrect readings ever since. I'd rather spend my money on T-Mobile SIM card and find my mobile that way alot more reliable",
      "In a world of unknown danger, it's wonderful to have a program that assist in accurately communicating my loved ones locations. We've used it on, unfortunately, several occasions to find a lost phone. It even once accurately indicated the phone laying in the gutter of the road. It's an incredible app. We love it."

      "Ok, When I first started using the app. I tried the free and then to the Ultimate. For whatever reason, I can no longer look at my history tracks through Google maps. I can only see my recent tracks. No good. I need to be able to go back on the calendar and look at my tracks for any specific day. Can anybody help me with this issue ?? Thanks Jim",
      "Really useful app for solo adventure motorcycling giving your family access to your track/location. I haven't found a more useful one. I don't leave it on all the time, just when on a ride. Been a subscriber for a long time, maybe more than 3 years. App seems to drop back to 5 minute tracking updates if your phone goes to lock (e.g. when in your backpack) and devs seem to be unable to fix this through many Android updates despite me logging an issue. This is really annoying as the <5 minute tracking is one of the main features I wanted and I was happy to pay for it. Something weird going on with track viewing right now where is it marking map with \"For Development Purposes Only\". This is terrible and makes the maps very difficult to read.  And you can export your track only once every hour. Bizarre! Maybe they are not paying their Google bills? Would be 5 star but for the issues mentioned.",
      "Used to be pretty good, but now it isn't getting along with Google Maps to show the track. Once I'm done using it this time, I'll be looking for a different app.",

      "I like the app but it gets so annoying when I'm trying to save a place. It always goes to my 'saved places' and I can't get it to switch to 'want to go' or 'favorites.' I can't create any new lists either. I've tried searching up how to do it but unless I'm missing something, you can only do it on the regular Google maps.",
      "Functions well enough, but there's no way to sign out of your Google account like there is on regular Maps. There's an option to temporarily switch to the browser incognito mode, but it will quietly switch itself back out as soon as you change any other setting (showing the traffic map, for example). It's very low memory and featureful, but this is not privacy friendly.",
      "This app used to tell me street and freeway names - now it never says either, just \"turn right in 1000 ft\" (hint: use tenths of miles, which is what our cars use). Or \"take the interchange on the right\" when there may be several interchanges within the next mile. BIG step BACKWARDS, Google - way to go!",
      "Something that was good is now rubbish, what happened to google maps? It sucks at finding my location, it is slow and it trys to hard to be clever. Also putting the navigation feature on a different app feels like a dick move. Don't worry Waze is to the rescue.",
      "I'm not sure what happened to their algorithm but their estimated traffic and ETAs consistently make me late. Edit: this app is completely unusable. I have calibrated over and over and it cannot locate my location despite being hooked up to wifi and on high accuracy location setting. This is ridiculous."

Lost that phone and now have a S10+ and the area at the top and bottom has been greatly reduced. when you are driving the route that has been laid out it would be nice if the driving route would follow along with your vehicle so that you don't need to keep swiping the screen to keep the vehicle being showed on the screen.",

I use it on a Samsung Galaxy J7 Crown running Android 9. Before the update I had an option to enter a destination & receive vox prompts to nav to it. Now all I can do is enter by vox and get no prompts even though it is called Voice Navigation. It has changed totally. I can only try to follow a bug on the selected route & hope I make the turns."

      "Love app! I would give a five rating. The only reason for a four, I have two children with iPhones. I am unable to accurately track them. I can track my other children with android to the exact address. I still love the app, Why? Our car was stolen we left a phone inside tracked phone and we recovered our car with in 30 minutes! I would love to see the iPhone location more accurate. I use this app to ensure my children are in safe locations, along with if they are in danger I have tabs on them.",
      "This app is great if I'm tracking Android phones, i can actually pinpoint exactly where the phone is in a house, but if I need to track my family on their Apple devices, the location is very poor. With Apple phones, it only gives a low accuracy. I really hope that this gets corrected, especially since i pay $10 every month for this service! If it gets fixed, I will change my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.",
      "What sucks about this is that there isnt any constant tracking it's only when you choose to track. Android devices are easy to track but iphone devices are always with low accuracy. Fix this issue and I will change my ratings. Also what sucks is that when you get this plan it notifies the other cells phones that you now are able to track them...",
      "This app does not give an exact location of your family members. Most times the general location is helpful for tracking movement, but it would not be good for an emergency. It is also tedious to set up alerts. I use it because my stepson would delete any apps that are more accurate.",
      "Extremely slow to update, accurate to within about 1/2 mile or more, frequently can't find the phone even when I am texting the phone and know there is good reception. Very disappointed."

      "GPS Navigation Is Convenient In A Small City Like Vlissingen. As A Matter Of Fact, Coming From The Bay Area Across From San Francisco, I Occasionally Keep Track Of Regular Scheduled Updated Technology Originating In The Bay Area And Have Found That It Has Become Increasingly Less Complicated To Follow. Thank You, Adrian Danker (53).",
      "so much more options and for me thats cool , Listen it is an Man made equipment and with new update technology , that will have glitches from time to time overall I feel that it's an excellent tool , even specially for the senior citizens it opens more doors for them , to find there way around places that they wouldn't get to go just because of worrying about being lost , like the New Update each time ....... allen d , pelion SC , 29123",
      "Not even one star, I installed your app and only get ads. It won't even give me my current location or route a simple test run. Not only that but as I write this review I notice there is no place to upload it to you. What a terrible joke of an app",
      "The advertisements are like intermittent sneezing in a bout of common cold, very irritating and distractive. Otherwise the app is quite handy and informative as one would wish for.",
      "This app is confusing. They keep adding more apps in order to continue using the original app. Eventuall, I will have to get rid of the whole thing. This apps don't explain if there's extra charges or not. I call this propaganda."

      "Would not record calls. Had no record button at all. It says to make a call through the app, but will direct me back to my phone, make the call, and have jo record button. I had to delete a contact and add them again for the app to update the contacts. To top it off, even though I couldn't get it to work anyway, you cannot make a phone call and record it unless you have the number as a contact in your phone. So you can't just dial the number and record the call. You have to save it as a contact.",
      "This app doesn't tell you the location of the caller it tells you the location I'm assuming of their phone carrier. This app also makes it harder to answer a call and seems to interrupt the call before you have time to answer the call. Im deleting.",
      "The locator does not tell you where the caller is it just tells you where the phone is from and it tries to tell you to download other apps I do not like it and I do not want you guys ot take any of my money out my account because I did not use it but once and that was free so I am disabling you guys and if you guys take any money out of my account I will reported. False advertising",
      "All it does is drive me nuts.. it's an app that gets in the way of anything to do with making a call to taking a call you're screwed if your in the middle of a game.",
      "Uninstalling. Too many ads, they make the app difficult to use. This app works. The ads make the experience frustrating. Pop-ups appear at every step. I'm OK with ads in a free app. I expect them. I'm not OK with the ads leading to aggravation when I use the app. Note to developers: It's a great app. You could have had a long term user. Instead you ruined the app with your greed and get-rich-quick ideas. Uninstalled!!!"

I send a request with all the payments and my account screen shot 10 day ago...and still nothing. I'm starting to think that there is problem with the application and the people behind it. How long I have to wait?????????????? Edit 13/03: I send you 5 times my ID, now it's 2 weeks that I send the 1st quest and npthing. So unprofessional!!! I can not understand....",
      "App use to work great. I updated it and now it's still ok but it was better before. It's still a very good app. I wish app developers would learn how to leave well enough alone. If it's not broken don't try to fix it. It still deserves 5 stars. Thanks",
      "Would have given 5 stars but for the recent update. Location updates are slow and buggy. Also, would have liked to go paid but the app is too expensive.",
      "Looks good, but needs to have locations set up for the circle. I have ten users and coming from Life360 I will be setting up 25+ locations that every one needs notifications from. I will not move to this until that's resolved. Just to paint the scenario; been on Life360 for 3 years. Excellent and reliable. Saw the sale for this and thought I'd try it out. 25 locations, for 10 users. They all want notifications. So, that's 5,500 taps to set up notifications for all. No thanks.",
      "Not accurate. Stopped working yesterday 02/29. Not sure why. Not reporting location. Battery is 100%. No support whatsoever."

    "description":"A single tap on the map gives you access to world coordinates. In addition, Map Coordinates offers a full set of tools like distance measurement, current GPS location, history / favorite locations, share location, find location or copy coordinates / address. You can switch between multiple coordinate types like decimal degrees, DMS (degrees, minutes and seconds) or even special types like what3words, MGRS,  UTM or GEOREF.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed to easily determine the coordinates and address of a point on the map and share them with friends via SMS, email or social apps.\r\n\r\nWhen you need to find a location, you can either type / paste the address / coordinates in a search field or enter each coordinate value one by one in it’s own field using the advanced search options. what3words, MGRS,  UTM or GEOREF can be searched for only by using the single search field.\r\n\r\nThe current GPS location is best received while the mobile device is located outdoors. The GPS satellites are easy to be found when there is no interference like buildings or clouds. Even if the device is located indoor, the location can be accurately found through WiFi network but only if the device is connected to that network. \r\n\r\nThe side drawer menu is used to navigate between different parts of the app like History / Favorites but it is also used to switch the map provider. The available map providers are Google Maps and Open Street Maps, each of them having different map types. Under Open Street Maps there is also a compass available all the time.\r\n\r\nSettings can also be accessed from the side navigation drawer. There you have the options to switch between existing coordinates types, change the visibility of the address bar or you can enable the Distance measure tool and the Elevation tool. Elevation displays the altitude of the selected location on the map.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. GPX and KML file types are supported with certain limits: Only simple waypoints are processed for GPX files and only Placemarks are processed for KML files.\r\n2. UTM, MGRS and GEOREF coordinates types are available as paid options\r\n\r\nWe hope that this app fulfills your needs but if you have any other expectations, please don’t hesitate to contact us and we will try to help you out.",

My task was given to find and inspect location and place using only co- ordinates. I got very help from this app. This app gave exact location in tiny islet, island also. Thanks Many many thanks",

      "Its nice but need more work at its accuracy on real locations. And not show name in many villages in pakistan. I sure u will give attention on this. Thanx",
      "Not thrilled with the inaccuracy. Also will not track accurately to the coordinates I enter."
