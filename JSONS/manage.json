On the investment options need to add an option for interest. If I transferred the amount(with interest) from investment, it's showing the excess amount as liability.",
      "Works well on Android 8. Comprehensive account management and transaction types. I do a lot of transactions dealing in foreign currency tho, I wish it were possible to specify the exchange rate at which each transaction was conducted. Also, the PC manager doesn't work at all for me. And the video showing a demo is from 2013.",
      "Great app, probably best money/budget manager for android, however there's lack of few quite basic functions that it should have, like: - when entering new expense/transfer etc. option to enter amount in two currencies, because right now it forces to go to settings and change exchange rate before each entry that is multi currency (when you pay in a currency different that the account/card currency). - really basic thing, quite strange it does not have such option: a-z sorting for categories - another so basic thing that almost all similar apps have it: option to search category by starting typing letters that are in that category, not start but are even in the middle.",
      "Every thing is great. Only issue is there is no share option to share the details or data. Developers Please add share option which will help us lot. Thanks ***After response received from devloper*** I asked for sharing option but there is nothing mentioned regarding share option. Request u please include share option for every page so that it can be share with others. Thanks",
      "Tried nearly every similar app and concluded that this one is just the best. Very stable and well designed. Web browser accessible, backups, fully customizable. Also, free version does everything, no need to pay, but I recommend to buy the app just to support the creators, it's worth the price indeed."

      "Great airline management game, overall. Discovered this game when looking for flight sims. The overall concept is cool and the game is not repetitive as you can use different strategies. However, the only thing I dont really like is the \"other costs\" in newer planes. In real life, airlines arw buying efficient A350s and 787s. In this game, people are buying 1970s 742Bs because it has low other costs. If this problem is solved, the game would be much more realistic, and you will get a 5 stars :)",
      "Update: i try to learn to play this game for 2 weeks, and i like it. But tonight your server have a problem, i cant login with all internet connection i have... it say: http error 502 || one more thing, you have a serious performance issue.. your game is too laggy for this type of game which only concern with text and images. Wasteful of smartphone resources...",
      "A really amazing game! We are hoping for future updates for the A330-900neo as its MTOW in real-life was increased so maybe consider adding its in-game range from 11,100km to 12,130km. Also, gradual inclusion of new airports that we suggested in \"add airport website\". Thank you and hoping for the best Kudos and keep safe.",

      "Terrible app. Wish I didn't have to use it. It doesn't load the page when you try and scroll down. It's doesn't load new messages, it doesn't load recent notifications. There will notifications that are know are there that simply aren't showing in the notifications tab, but then you can find them on the other notifications tab (as if you need two?!) But then you click on the notification which takes you to the post but the comment isn't even there, same with messages. Just completely useless.",
      "Hi, this app very good for the beginning.. It easy to use and very helpful. But, in this month it had a problem. I already Uninstalll this app for one weeks to see what happen. Then, now i install it again and still the same. I already refresh then it same. I can't see any post in my page. Please help me.",
      "When I first got the app in Jan 2020 I loved it. However, it has only gotten worse with the new updates. I keep getting a million emtpy mobile albums when doing pics. With the newest update I can't upload my pictures in a post, to the album I want. At all. I can't upload videos and pictures together anymore. Videos can't even go into albums. If I attach a picture in post, I can't schedule it anymore. Has to be published then and there. It sucks. I'm disappointed. I love the old version better..",
      "Nothing about this app works properly. Notifications show forever, even when read/deleted. Or reappear later. Even doing a simple task, like creating an event, is prone with breakdowns at every opportunity. Nothing loads as it shoud. One of the worst app experiences I've ever had.",
      "Very delayed updates; though the app notifies me of messages from clients, I don't get to see them no matter how many times I refresh. It has taken up to several hours just for it to update and show me the new messages. Because of this, I am unable to respond to clients immediately, especially urgent concerns. Please fix this! If it can work better in that aspect alone it would definitely fulfill its purpose to help admins who are constantly on the go."

      "It was 5 stars, since I was enjoying it, everything is going well and I keep on levelling up, currently on level 5. Until I needed to delete it to be reinstalled in a couple of minutes. Then when I reinstalled it, I was back to level 3. I spent days playing it even spent some money because I really love playing it. But very disappointed of what happened. Other players, be careful of deleting this game. You might lose your games and just waste your time and even money. Such a waste. Still up tho.",
      "Good concept but heavily flawed and buggy. You cannot advance in the game without gold coins. I'm practically stuck at level 6. You're supposed to get one free gold a day. I've played every day but have not gotten my daily coins. Also the free coins you do get mysteriously disappear with no rhyme or reason. Yesterday when I logged off I had 9 coins, today when I logged in I have 6. I'm not buying coins if the free ones aren't accounted for correctly.",
      "It is fun but the fact that u don't earn actions and just a tiny amount of gold coins to progress sucks. I think the game should give gold coins according to what is required to actually play the game like they can give u 3 gold and to fill actions bar it takes 25. U need to spend real life money to actually be successful in this game",
      "Great game, really enjoyable. Personally I think action time needs to be addressed every 30 minutes does make it super slow to begin with Lots of potential, gold coins are hard to come by for a non pay to win scenario. You should be able to purchase with both gold and in-game cash the account for example is a massive game changer",
      "Great game few issues but am sure theyll be ironed out in the future, takes some time to get into but is a good game to check in on once or twice a day Edit: didnt receive 10 coins for the raiting as you said i would, if unintended please add coins to the account if intentional then the rating will significantly drop."

      "I love Hitask web a lot, however, the app doesn't work that well. Somehow, because I've used the web version first when I started to use the app, all the task that I've create started to duplicate. Also, on the app, when I want to see what task I have for the day it doesn't respect the time order, everything is just all over the place and it's frustating because this app is supposed to keep me organized and it doens't feel like that. I hope that in the future they can improve the app, meanwhile, I'm going to keep using only the web version, WHICH I LOVE.",
      "Sleek looking and easy to use. I am using it to replace the (soon to be discontinued) Wunderlist. The current version (18.1) duplicate any tasks after date editing and syncing, deleting them is easy but I really hope you guys fix that bug on the next release. Good luck and keep up the excellent work.",
      "Total lack of inteligence how life operates, corporate environment , personal life in time and space . Absolutely out of context of real life. I dislike it right from first use. The white page is ugly . Pittie for the mindset of the designer. I play with it later for a few hours and guaranteed to Delete, Dicard, with strong feelings of dislike ! ! I strongly regret to downloading it the at all.",
      "I have tried to make this app work but it is to a no avail. I like the concept, features, appearance, but too many problems makes it unusable for me. When I create tasks & set times, like 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 o'clock, etc., they get listed, for example, as 12, 8, 10, 11, 9, 13, no matter how much I try to sort it by Start date, or End date, or Priority. And there is no manual sorting. So I have to look down the list & try to notice what task comes now, which one later. Better to take pen & paper",
      "i dont see notifications, feel problems in setting reminder time however it should be flexible so that we can set time in minutes and notification sound cannot be changed or set, we should be able to set any sound we want from our phone for notifications the way we want... push notifications should go like a call or sms buzzing the one to wake up and do the task. so should be for self reminder. i look forward to give 5 stars soon when all is fixed by u expert people 😊"

Enough to replace every essential app that comes with your cell phone and spies on you. They are all simple,clean, straight forward and great. I bought the paid versions to support the developer. Do it! They deserve it!",
      "this manager allows drag and select multiple files. not many other apps have such capability. but the drag and select function of this app needs more improvement, it has to be able to scroll the file listing (view) up or downward. thumbnails view of the files should be allowed",

      "Very rare unusual bugs. (Nothing serious. e.g. Wrong thumbnail file image appeared after copying a file??) Almost always very intuitive. (First time I copied/moved files to SD Card was difficult. But now easy.) Most important this App has never crashed/lost (deleted) any files."

      "Absolutely wonderful app for my Dog Business. The Tags are great and make organizing my clients easy. Would definitely recommend and I'm definitely buying the Pro version!",
      "I have tested nearly every CRM out there and i HATE THEM for charging a monthly fee - what you only find out after you have registered with them. Clienti was the first app i found that i can use without the need of a registration, though there is such an option where you can pay 4 EUROS per month to backup your data, what i do not need and like but that is my own opinion.  One main reason why i do not wanted to register with the other big CRM players is the data - nobody knows that they do with the data that you enter and specially the amount of money and sensitive contact information. And they also lack, just like clienti a bit, in having no \"open\" import or export option. Thats obvious because they do not want you to move from one service to other and take your data with you.  Otherwise i love the ClientiApp, though these few things might be hopefully changed in the near future:  IMPORT FUNCTION To import your data you need to upload a CSV file to the clienti website. As i mentioned above, i want my data to be secure and kept with me.  MANUAL There is a \"Group\" option where you can create a group but i have not found out what this is good for.",

      "Fantastic. The platform gives me visibility into 15 different financial accounts at a quick glance. Really great tool to keep track of everything happening in your financial life. A few bugs once and a while but eventually the developers sort that out. I never experience any long-term issues with bugs or errors. Highly recommend for anyone looking to get a grasp on their financial life. Also, comes packed with budgeting tools if you are looking for that.",
      "Takes about two months to figure out the budgeting and how it aligns with your spending but since I've started using it in October I've been able to consistently save money and pay off credit cards. I have really enjoyed the bar charts to show when you are green, yellow, or red in terms of spending habits. I always used an excel sheet for budgeting but it is so nice to have an app auto update all expenses.",
      "I used Mint for a long time then it stopped syncing to my bank account in spite of numerous attempts to fix it. I'm sad that I will be looking for an alternative app if these problems continue much longer. Who has time to devote to figuring out the help system maze via Facebook or Twitter? Not me. I'm obviously not the only one experiencing this either.",
      "I like using the app so I can check my finances in real time. It works pretty well. Here are some things I'd like to be able to do. - rules carry-over from desktop version to app - ability to assign categories to pending transactions (otherwise, the app miscategorizes and we get a notification of over-spending) - modified: adding a new merchant is possible! Up'd my review to 4 stars.",
      "VERY useful 👍 but not customizable 👎 I can see where my money goes, I can link accounts (so I don't have to manually enter transactions), and there are lots of useful tools (budgets, spending trends/charts, 'hiding' transactions from spending trends for more accurate budgeting, bill tracker, credit score, etc). But I cannot: customize categories at all (adding new/editing existing), which also translates into not being able to customize budget items or rearrange the list of items in my budget."

Received a quick reply from the developer who suggested that I try the pro version, which I did. it is much better. I like it. Now all I want to do is to make sure that I can sync my contacts with other devices and ditch Google contacts.",

I want to reset my phone so I attempted to export my contacts to a file. The app does not recognize any contacts to export even though I am looking right at them. Very frustrating.",

So it is not encouraging me to buy players from division outside Europe 2. The salaries are not realistic, don't put salaries if all players demand the same. Everton soares real life salary is just 24k per week. Plus this effect clubs budgeting big time. 3. Overall rating in match is close to garbage. Sorry.",
      "The best football manager game. Just loving it. But, I have one suggestion regarding training. Why should my outfield players undergo goalkeeper training ? I think that session is being wasted for them. It would've been great if I could choose the training session specifically for each player/group. For eg, technical training for midfielders while goalkeeping training for GKs in the same session. But, either way the game is developing in the right direction. Keep up the good work.",
      "Cross early bug when putting player's individual functions, also, I can't save the game. Continuos errors. I was liking the game very much but with those bugs it's impossible to play. Edit: I've changed to 5 stars again because the problem hasn't appeared again. I had to erase the career mode I was in though. Hope it won't happen again, the game is entertaining.",
      "I want to like this game, I really do, It's a really good game, Training players is easy, The video system to help speed things along is great, It's just when you get to the matches, You'll watch your team dominate possession, Shots, Corners, Free kicks, hit the woodwork numerous times and lose because your defender decides to control the ball and put the opposing striker through on goal, It also doesn't feel as if anything you do with the tactics actually makes a difference",
      "The game is super fun, super and very very addicting. But i have to give 3 star because the club budget always decreasing every week, there is no way we could avoid it, and i think it's very anoyying. I have a suggestion, if the budget have to be decreased because of player wages, why don't separate the budget for transfer and budget for wage, like in football manager in pc, so the transfer plan that have been made from the beginning won't be disturbed"

      "Okay, it,s not the greatest experience, but it does the job well enough. The reason I installed the app was because it offers me a single manager to access not only local files but also my server without having to start the difficult to use synology file manager. It also does auto rotate, something I,ve found not all file manager apps do. Kudos for including both features.",
      "Usually a GREAT app - have downloaded on multiple devices and love the features. I do agree w/ 1 of the other reviews here; since Feb 2020 or so, constant glitches & force-closing occur. Uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared as much of my phone cache as I could find, tried various modules in the app. Nothing. Have to uninstall for now but will be back, hope this helps dev",
      "Useful but (fromfeb 2020) unstable and may pose risks on newer/ updated device Back then, I used the program because it has features like SMB and other NAS support. Unfortunately, the app isn't able to keep up with time. New android updates have made the program a risk/threat. It has hang/ crashed during data transfer. Most importantly, it has deleted files from my SD card on multiple occasions. If necessary, copy the files to disposable SD using the built in file manager before using this",
      "Great file-manager app with very useful feature, \"duplicate files\" in storage analyzer. Have picture viewer built-in, only video player not included. But when i view some image, i see hard to slide it to see next/previous image with fast slide, must use from left to right to view another images, maybe because i'm use different phone. The overall of app is great",
      "I've been using this for years, but now, after the update, annoying and irritating \"force close\" happens whenever I move or copy files, and even renaming files. Please fix asap. I've been encountering this bug/error for months."

      "This app is very simple and very well put together. However, I am giving one star due to the fact that when observing your annual savings chart, the app only factors in expenses (non-recurring) and not bills (recurring). This is a big problem due to the fact that a vast portion of everyones monthly expenses stems from bills. If this feature could be implemented, I would gladly return and give this 5 stars.",
      "I typically don't review apps however I found this one especially helpful. It has a good ui/ux and most of the functionality that is needed to quickly track and log expenses. I gave it 4 stars not bc a lack of quality but because I think that it could use abit of tweaking on the yearly/monthly savings overview. It would be nice if it showed a monthly breakdown of expected savings based on the bills/expenses that are recurring minus the recurring income. Other then that, timelybills is fantastic.",
      "I am about 80-90% satisfied with this app. It is the only one I was able to find that does NOT connect to any of my bank or credit card accounts. I am just NOT ready for any apps to have direct contact to any of my personal business as there are a lot of them that does. I rather enter any information manually. The only other thing I would like to see with this app is the ability to see my running balance as to how much I have left to spend on the home screen. This is very important to me!",
      "Very nice and neat app, love it! Paid for the ads-free version on third day of use , totally worth it. Potential enhancements: finger print or facial login, allow to backup at google cloud, after upgrade to ads free version show more features on dashboard, like budget and settings, since there is more screen real estate, also after ads free upgrade push some useful articles on dashboard, such as good money habit.. Bug: top right 3 dots -> settings -> any option -> go back, it goes to main dash",
      "I really like that I don't have to connect this to my bank account. I can get reminders of bills and a view of, say, bills due or anticipated this week. I only would like to be able to see bills and income on the same screen so I know if a certain bill is covered by an upcoming check or not."

There's a constant banner-type message on the main page which says I need to log in to avoid losing all my data. But it doesn't let me log in. Every time I've tried the screen does a weird thing and I get an error. I've tried logging in with all the options given and it does the same thing. If this can be fixed I'll upgrade to 5 stars. Till then I shall continue to live in fear of losing my data",
      "Disappointed with the feature of not being able to restore your data from an older device. I was consistently maintaining a tab of all my expenses on a daily basis for the last 7 months. However, my phone was stolen a couple of days back. Now, after installing the app on my new phone, I'm not able to login and view all my expenses. The whole purpose of using this app is defeated if I cannot login to another device and view my expenses. Very disappointed.",
      "Great, easy to use app to just track where your money goes. What does annoy me: you cannot set date range. We don't all get paid on the first or last of the month. If my month runs 15th - 14th, I am unable to properly track monthly expenses. Wish this would be fixed. Then 5 stars from me!",
      "Such a great UI. The best interface and convenient to use. Had fallen in love with the whole operation. But despite may negative reviews the developers are ignorant of the login issue. Please atleast respond so we know you're working on a fix. Don't ruin your whole product just because of such a simple issue. Please fix it. I myself am a developer and know how important a product is to a developer. Please care about it. And care about the what your consumers think.",
      "Love this app. I am only just getting to really use it now I have moved out. It has an easy pie chart to work out where all your money is going. It will also have the amount you spent and a percentage. I learnt 46% is a bit high for my household bills. Bit have paid a one off insurance for a car. So this will vary monthly. I'm not the best with money and find It hard to save. It would be a good idea to be able to add 2 savers accounts. As I don't mix my main account with the savings ones."

      "The program functions like a dream.. but it's a bit cost prohibitive But functionally, I couldn't ask for more. One critique: If I create a payment method of escrow, it changes to paid as a status. Technically, escrow needs to close or be disputed...so ideally there would be a status of IN escrow, then paid/closed. I would suggest adding escrow as a preloaded payment form and adding the other two invoice status....that's the only work around I found that I needed. Not sure if I can afford it",
      "This program can not properly manage a grouped or composite item. When you contact support they will be unable to help you beyond the help documentation you have already read. They will waste days of your time waiting for call backs and returned e-mail.",
      "I have lots of issues with unflexible working programs of zoho. Primarily i want automated integration with my platforms for sales order. Secondary when i creat invoice from sales order i dont want all the items in the invoice i just want item group head name as item and rest of there varient in description Adding to much item variant in Item list seems very unprofessional on pages and last thing is whenever i created sales package i have to remove all the item again to select one item Change it",

      "I am sad to say that this app has some nice qualities, but I am very disappointed right now. I wanted to like this app, but I was robbed of a win on their lucky spin wheel! The wheel landed on a $50 Amazon gift card and then, as if to say \"Oops just kidding\" it makes a rapid jump to the next prize of 15 coins! What the hell!! Even the \"shout outs\" mentioned my name and the $50 I was suppose to have won, but was just swiped away from right under me!! Also they practically force a 5 star rating!!",
      "Doesn't seem to support sharing MMS or locations, separates combined contacts so be prepared for lots of duplicates. I Don't want an app that doesn't support the best features that come with our stock messaging apps but it adds several unnecessary features like optimizer and booster, which most phones already come with. The app keeps closing as I'm typing this. 3rd time having to reopen. Definitely not recommended. Uninstalling!",
      "I miss the old version this new app is sinking i cant see what i am typing unless i use quick or pop reply",
      "ASAP kept stopping over and over a couldn't even type messages without its stating that there is no problem with this app I really like this at first what is the problem with this app why did it do that",
      "So it felt a little misleading. I was hoping that this app would have all of my accounts in one place. Allowing me to remove all other apps. This app just provides you with notifications. It's like a watcher app. I don't need that I wanted one app that allowed me to login to everything and handle direct messaging with it."

      "Since the last two updates I'm unable to assign a due date to new or existing tasks. When I try to set the date and tap \"OK\" nothing changes and the due date remains unset. It works fine on the desktop app so it is very frustrating when I am away from my office using my tablet and trying to add tasks to my schedule but can't set a due date. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 running Android 4.4.2 with the latest version of the app installed. I have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but no change. Can you please help ☺",
      "Cant use the time tracking feature in the app. This is one of the main things I use redbooth for.",
      "Just signed up for a trial online. Service looked useful so I installed the app, only to have it get stuck on the \"Almost there\" screen. Forced closed app. No change. No point in re-installing as this was a new install. Just cancelling my trial. The 3 stars is because the tool seems useful on the web, but I didn't get a good feeling when the app didn't load. Not worth my time to troubleshoot at this point.",
      "Desktop app is good. Over the past month or so the Android app has really fallen apart. Nothing works anymore and customer service is extremely slow with a response. Not sure how they let this app decline so quickly. Unless they fix this app it is not good enough for any kind of project management much less running any kind of business application. Extremely disappointing given how good the desktop app is. But not being able to use the mobile version is a deal breaker for me.",
      "Though the web portal works mostly fine, but the app version has plenty of issues and features missing. Please add the \"date & time spent\" edit feature to edit the pre-added date and time of a task's comment. Also if the search feature is added inside the workspace task view it would be great."

      "Great App! I like it. It has all what I need in a Sales POS App. But this last update brought something am not comfortable with. Please go back to the former small window that pops up when you click on an item that contains one product, big for many products. So one can easily tap on an empty area of the screen to dismiss without going down for the back button. Now it fills the screen always irrespective of the no of items leaving a large and useless white portion and blocking the whole screen.",

The only issue i found is sometimes it is connection to Bluetooth Printer lost, have tried with 3 different phones and 2 different Bluetooth Printer the result are the same. Hope it can be fixed. The other thing is somehow Zobaze cannot open the cash drawer after transaction received. I will give 5 starts when above issue can be resolved. Great job Zobaze team!",
      "App is so good for managing small or home based business. Checked plenty of other apps. Love the simplicity and the feature of staff managenent. This really deserves a 5 star. However, rating 4 as there is no option to export the data in csv or xls, pdf in customer, products and sales forms. Also please add that feature ASAP.",

      "Fast, easy file manager from Xiaomi. When I'm not using Termux to manage files I use this application especially if I'm looking for a certain video photo and don't remember what the name was. Offers basics such as file compression/decompression, copy, delete, move, etc. Have sensitive eye's like me? DAMN my big, beautiful blue eyes… Not a problem due to a application wide dark mode which can be found in the left side menu. It makes me want a Xiaomi/Redmi device. This 2016 Pixel is washed up.",
      "An enterprise-level official app shouldn't contain any ads! Or at least allow us to buy a Pro version of the app that's ads-free. It doesn't even have the \"Cut\" feature (I had to copy, paste, and then remove the old file, instead of cut/paste). Go for Solid Explorer.",
      "It is a great file manager, but I have an issue, Not all my drive folders are showing in the file manager, almost 100 folders are visible, while I have 300 of folders, rest of them are not visible. And wish I could have the feature to directly stream videos from drive. Hope you will look into it and fix this issue, lower the rating for your attention.",
      "This is actually amazing. Organising my files was such a hassle, I love how when I press to go back it takes me back to the previous file location, no matter sd or internal, it makes things easier and I don't have to keep manually going back to the file locations after I move or copy. Smooth and easy interface, user friendly. Good job!",
      "No option to keep multiple files with the same name in the same folder when I move or copy them (normally it should ask if you want to rename the copied files, but not in this app). And also, the confirmation buttons when I copy or moving the files keeps popping out it makes the app looks annoying, you should add buttons like \"skip all\", \"rename all\" and \"replace all\" everytime I copy files with the same name instead of confirm it one by one"

The only problem is that there is no option to export the CSV to Google Sheets or connect to a database. Thumbs up to the developer! Bravo!",

      "Love this app. Was trialing out various apps to take notes and agendas. Most were not only visually meh but were not supporting what I was looking for. This app ticked many boxes and exceeded what I need Love the interface and user friendly. Compatible for several devices and op systems. Almost felt equivalent to a physical notebook. The reason for giving a 4* was due to the inability with a filing or downloading feat as this was something I was specifically looking to store old agendas.",

I think the premium is too expensive, it's 5-10 times more expensive than the apps I'm usually buying. And at the same time, I don't need most of the premium features. Though, I don't know any good alternative. Probably it would make sense to switch to the \"addon\" model. Instead of selling a single premium with all of the features, developers could split it into multiple cheaper addons. For example, I'd pay to remove limitations (like changing appearance), but I wouldn't like to pay for advanced features like OK Google and Input Parser.",
      "I like using the app. The only issue I have is paying for it for each device use it on.",
      "I've used this app for years, tried others always to come back to this one. It isn't the slickest interface and other apps appeal more to me visually, but I haven't found anything that beats this for simply keeping up with ne and getting things done.",
      "I've used MLO on desktop for years, and have played with this Android app since it started. Now with a new Android tablet, it's good to see the progress they've made. MLO works the way I need it to. I suspect that whatever system you have developed, it will work for you too.",
      "Looking at a replacement GTD app for doit.im and I have tried many over several months. MLO may not have the best UI but it seems really rock solid, ultra flexible, and supports a very rapid workflow. This is definitely my choice!"

      "I absolutely adore this app! I've had this app since 2010... and I had stopped using it for a few years after my spending habits got under control! 10 years later I was looking for an app to help me keep track of my expenses in place of spreadsheets. I stumbled upon this app again and realized it was what I needed at the time. I'm so happy to use it. It helps me consciously understand and be mindful of my money. Thank you for making this app!",
      "great way of tracking what you spend!!",
      "Easy to use and gets the job done. Which is good. However i don't like the idea of everything that happened in 2019 and before to become irrelevant because of their yearly/monthly filters. Would be nice if we can view \"last 6 months\" or last year. To include data from previous months. Also we can only filter one category at a time, which seems an easy fix. Would be nice if we can filter 2 or more categories for a comparison. Etc",
      "Awesome so far. I'm finally getting all my finances in order. While it's amazing what you spend If you keep track it. So far very few ads and the app is running perfectly not a single hitch. So after one month I am deeply impressed. I never a take the time to read an app.. This time I am making an exception. Good job.",
      "It does what it says - it helps me track my spending. Easy to use. Functionally useful. MS Money it is not but for day to day tracking and cash flow monitoring it fits my bill. Had a couple of queries early on but received prompt responses which sorted me out. Would recommend it."

A huge bottleneck in my opinion.",

      "Game runs great, I loved that fact that you can upload your own logo, for free, and build your airline. Of course the game speed is real time, a nice touch especially on those longer routes. Only issue I noticed is when the game refuses to open but that is because my internet had dropped out. So the game won't load if your internet is down",
      "The game itself is quite good fun but has a good number of bugs that you can live with but do spoil the gameplay. The biggest problem with this game is the online board/forum. There are some players (three in particular, Bear, Mt Shasta & Global Alliance) who seem to stalk the boards seeking players to antagonize and do so with impunity from the moderators. Any comments in response are deleted by the mods. It appears to be a playground for childish cyber bullies that is unfairly moderated.",
      "This game is one of the coolest games I've played, I highly recommend it to everyone who is interested in business, and aviation.... BUT I dont recond it to those who cant stand people that think that they are the s*** on the game. The community is very negative, and will judge you on everything you do. To make it 5 stars, the creator should do something about it.",
      "A bad minimalist version of AM2. Planes look bad, advertisement is way too expensive, it's really annoying to precisely set the amount of seats on planes. There's cool features but if you want to have fun then download AM2 or 4",
      "So far mediocre. Keeps crashing when trying to buy aircraft. No real tutorial. We'll see how it goes."

I should be able to prefill these fields one time, NOT auto fill each time.",

      "Nice app...but to me as freelance THE big issue is that the cool features i need come with business plan which price is a bit on the high end compare to other tools on the market...but I could live with that because I like using the tool but what is totally off is that if you want business license features you need to subscribe at least three licenses even if you only need one (roughly 100$ per month!!!)",

Some things I love: multi-sort options; ability to create, rename & move files & directories - even between phone & SD card; search; Main screen = Manage Storage shows used/capacity for sd & phone, files by type. Too much to list.",
      "I've used this little. It has loaded OK and I was able to navigate fine. Playing music files is where it falls down. Some times it will play continuously, but then stops. Start again and may manually start the next. Then plays multiple files again. Will stop at any time. There is no menu item to say play continuous. Also, most songs \"hiccup\" in the first few seconds. Either the start is missing or pieces are missing or it jumps a little. It is curious. For files, I'll use it. I'm looking for another player that is consistent.",
      "I have a Kindle /Fire and I have tried move to SD card apps and others like which did not work. But this app not only helps you with sorting your apps. But the coolest of all is. It helps you to delete pre-installed bloat ware. I can't say enough how much I love this app. THANK YOU FILE MANAGER.",
      "A fully functional app that does everything a file manager should do, easily and with no fuss. I decided to support the dev by purchasing the Premium option that removes the in-app ads and adds a dark theme. What/who you \"pay attention\" to, \"buy\" from, which websites you go to, what links you click on, all of these are tangible votes that have tangible results. \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\"",
      "The ability to resume a video where you last left it has been removed, now the video starts from the beginning, please bring that back. The app doesn't switch off other sound apps when you use it anymore instead you end up with two apps simultaneously emitting sound, please bring back that function. When connected to a Bluetooth device and you disconnect the device the app doesn't automatically stop the sound, instead it continues playing what you were playing, please bring that function back."

The date range coverage can't be manipulated, it is fixed per month. Say the date range is per month only (e.g Jan 1-Jan31, Feb 1-Feb-29). I would love it more if they would put options say from (Feb 15 - March 15) or Every Quarterly.",

      "Paid twice to use on 2 devices but for a paid app there are faults. Gsync does not work on either, a between accts transfer leaves a balance of 14 digits in pounds and 40p on both instead of zero and there is no shortcut to enable entering a transaction without opening the app as described in the description. I do have the latest version and these faults happen on both devices. Apart from these I am happy with the app and will continue to use it.",

      "The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the \"custom repeat\" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators.",
      "This initially looks a bit confusing. However, this design actually functions extremely well. The way it can act as both a clock, date, alarm and agenda widget at the same time is just incredibly efficient. It also provides you with a very easy way to evaluate at which times of the day you have events and more importantly: when you have breaks and how long they are. All this at a glance, compared to clunky agenda widgets where you have to sit and calculate it in your head. Well worth the money!",
      "It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.",
      "I love this app ; the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense. Sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors. Also I've found the colors are very limited. When it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events, it gets it wrong or doesn't have the color.",
      "I like it. What I would really like to be able to do with it is to set it on my homepage to where as soon as I open my phone my schedule is right there in place of my clock. Food for thought 😁. Thanks! Edit: wow! Thanks! Developer responded to my query within hours. Changed from 4 to 5 ☆☆☆☆☆!!!!"

      "This is my favourite productivity app. I've tried loads of different ones but this is the one that works best for me. I can use it for so many different projects and I love it. The option to use it across different devices would be cool though",
      "Great app, mostly. I use the due dates on tasks within projects to generate a daily to-do list, and it does really need a few little tweaks: 1. To clear completed tasks from the \"All Tasks\" view, or at least send them to the bottom or get them out of the way somehow. 2. Drag to reorder All Tasks, or any way to control the order of the tasks. 3. A widget that shows All Tasks, so it can be used as a to-do list. Preferably with an ability to check them off/mark them completed through the widget.",
      "Perfect for what I wanted, to have tasks and break em down further to the steps needed to complete em while all of it being tracked and fed back to a higher progress tracking. Beautiful and easy to use. Love it!",
      "So far, so good. I'm really liking the percentage calculation, but I think it would be even better if it could calculate a days quota. For example, I put a task where I need to learn 100 words in 5 days. It will automatically tell me I need to learn 20 words a day. However, if I miss a day, it will recalculate and say I need to learn 25 words in 4 days. Having the option to automatically put things in alphabetical order would be cool too.",
      "My organizational skills are not very good. This app is amazingly simple, but very effective! It forces some level of organization when inputting tasks, but has the flexibility to rearrange things as I realize that there is a better order. It is actually training my thinking to be better organized. Great app for those of us who have suffered a TBI. I highly recommend this for anyone that needs a little bit of organizational help!"

      "It is both flexible and complex. It has a great potential if you don't mind learning to code. The learning curve is a bit high and can be overwhelming. You can create different libraries for different purposes. Google sheets syncronization is great. The effort required to create a library is too much for me. It takes a lot of time. A specialized app is much better because it is tailored to a specific purpose and can be used immediately.",
      "I have used Memento for many years. I was a happy user and recommended it to many people around me until the the recent update. The new Version 4.7.3 abandoned the \"Link to Existing Document\" functionality which is very important to many of us. I hope the developer can put this functionality back soon and I will then happily change my rating from one star to more stars.",
      "I love this app. I had looked and looked for a database app but every other one had to be paid for after a certain number of entries. I found this app took another chance and loves it I had NO charge after a certain number of entries. U also can make whatever database u want either your own and where the autofill comes from and can be more than one. U can also add your own entries for that database or just pick a template u need which u can edit to fit your needs.",
      "Good fun this one. There is scope for some user documentation for the first time dbase designer. I spent a long time entering historic dates via the calendar, and would have welcomed an override mode of date entry.",
      "It is so difficult to figure out how to set up fields to display as you want. The terminology for each option doesnt actually describe what the option does. So much time wasted trying to figure it all out!"

      "The options of making money for team operations is nonexistent, starting with a weak team and no budget, really makes it impossible to improve your team. The training keeps getting expensive and the trades and free agents prices are out of touch. In just ten games I have fired a bad GM for a GM that's no better, so how does that give me an option to improve my team. I gave 4 stars for the game overall, I really enjoy the game so far.",
      "The only issue i have is you can't see other teams players to try and trade or look for more free agents.",
      "Random and weak. Can't control much. Too random to develop strategy.",
      "Twice now the game has frozen after completing around year 10 and while I'm in the middle of a year. It makes me restart a new career. Really like this game but this makes me not want to play it anymore. Please fix",

      "The app shows a list of supposedly running apps. After I click Boost button it claims I released 1.1 GB of memory. I then close and re-open app, it shows all the apps are back in memory. I click Boost and now I released 1.2 GB of memory. This app is confusing, misleading, and basically just a way to show me ads. This app used to work many years ago. Update: I ended up using an app called Greenify which worked great, plus it's free and no annoying ads to deal with.",
      "The app honestly feels way too bloated for a task manager. It's full of ads and \"share to Facebook\" type stuff. Why would my Facebook friends want to know I used a task manager? I can stand banner ads at the bottom, the devs gotta make some money, but video ads are really intrusive and kinda just make my performance issues worse when I need this app most.",
      "Not sure if app does stop notifications or just erase these from display, as whenever I am doing a boost keep coming same apps on display...an explanation may clarify the outcome. I've tried to buy it but couldn't find on Google play store even though I used the link from app...",
      "It hardly ever shows the apps that are running. Every once in awhile, it shows them and, it works. However not very often. I'm going to look elsewhere",
      "Doesn't seem to do anyting... Kill all shown tasks , but when I come right back , all tasks are up and running again... Plus no other or setting seems to reflect the difference... It's pretty though"

      "Really enjoying game, would have invested lots of real cash but boxed into having to pay real cash. Unfortunately, level 16+, have to start repairing machines (don't enjoy), slows things a lot & need storage space for Constr' items, Fruit, Fruit Drinks, Wrenches (repairs), Sport Reso' etc, have 30 spaces available, not per Item but overall, have to sell valuable items for space. Very slow or pay to progress! Glitches too.",
      "I like My Gym , becouse it's a little bessy game , it has lots and lots of levels , you can increese your gym's size you can buy decorations , exercising machines , and you can beild buildings next to your gym. Thank you for making My Gym a game . Why is My Gym not working since days ? Can you please fix it because I really want to play it and I also enjoy playing My Gym .",
      "Even though the game is fun my problem is the equipment the first time you buy is a fairly expensive price then when you go to get more of the same that you're already buying gets absurdly more expensive why is that? You need way to many items with each expansion which sucks. You don't have enough fruit trees so you're not getting enough fruit to make the drinks as they are being ordered.",
      "Upgraded from galaxy s8 plus to Note 10 and after many attempts, I cannot get my level 18 gym from old phone to migrate to the new one. My new device only has me at level 4 when I connect with Facebook. Although if I turn on my old phone it shows I'm level 18. Not going to go through all that progress all over again. Disappointing too, because I actually love the game otherwise.",
      "I got a new phone recently and when I opened the game it had me do the tutorial but afterwards when I signed into my account and Facebook account it didn't restore my progress. I was a level 14 and it took me forever to get there. It's a good game but I'm not going to waste my time trying to start over."

Its constantly reminding you of \"deals\" trying to peak the consumer interest in to spending a buck or two on impulsive progression. It's a rad concept but your typical phone app which is nothing more than a fat price tag neatly wrapped in pretty sounds and colors. RIP.",
      "Was a pretty good game until I started noticing the 'Overloot' triggering when there was plenty of space. Really makes the game not fun when you know you are doing the right thing and it still penalizes you. Fix your timing on the overloot and I will try again. Not worth it to continue especially at higher levels.",

While the majority are optional this game is clearly balanced with these ads in mind as far as your progression is concerned. Unlocked some of the later mechanics but they really don't add much or keep the gameplay fresh. Gets stale fast.",
      "The game is fun and engaging. A good mix of fast-paced strategy and simple rules. The two stars are due to the sloppy reaction time of selecting and combining items, as well as the system telling me I can't watch ads or make purchases due to \"no internet connection\". I can assure you I have internet connections. The irritation of those glitches doesn't outweigh the fun of the game, but they put the ownership of them on the user and not on the developers. Bad business blaming the customer.",
      "This game should not be out for this phone. Every kill create items, every item creation lags the game. Every lag make you put on gear you where trying to move or flat out ignore you are trying to move it. You get behind because of this, making the over loot happen constantly. And what a frustrating mechanic that is. This game might be good, but not when lagging."

      "This game is fun so far, but some builds yield \"stacked\" trains that all deliver at the same time and pace. I have one build where 20 trains always occupy the same slot, and can not be broken up. Please evaluate this for a higher rating. It would also be nice if there were a \"buy percentage of current money\" button. i.e. buy as many as possible with a max of 5% currency.",
      "This game would be great if it didn't lock the player into an unskippable tutorial that allows absolutely no room for individuality. I'm on my second game, stuck in the exact same spot where copper is needed by the town, I set that up. Nothing happened. I clicked the town to see what was up. Boom. Tutorial land wants me to build what I already set up again, because the tutorial wants me to use exactly these spots. Nothing else works. Skip button no longer functions. If you play, do it their way.",
      "A fun game of automation and progression. A good balance between an incremental game and a factor building game. Lots of fun~",
      "Awesome game. Nicely made. The idea of making the End Item with minute stuffs is very very interesting. Need more updates. More areas needed. Some small tweaks in terms of adding Train upgrades, train speed upgrades. Also storage space in each factory needs to be increased since Cola only increases production.",
      "There are next to none managment tools in this \"resource managment\" game, overview of train route, warehouse menu, basically all the list menus are terrible to navigate. Tech tree is kinda lame too - needs a lot of balancing, especially on Mars map - the amount of resources required for production of some parts makes no sense. Prices in the store are also ridiculous -makes it clear the Devs are just sh*tting half baked games and try to rip as much as possible - atm they have 3 games coming soon"

      "This game is frustrating and highly addictive in equal measures. Having started with League 2 Cambridge, I got them into a Champions League spot and won the Europa League in 12 seasons and am in the top 10 in the Premier League consistently. The frustrating bit: unless I've missed something, I have to pay cash for UEFA badges, to enable me to get a bigger job...or reach a reputation of Level 95 to get it free. Even by winning the Europa League and a League Cup with lowly Cambridge, I still only have a reputation of about 78! Paying you cash for progression and success (ironically for football) seems wrong.",
      "The game is great, yes. But would be better with a few fixes. No way I'll working my ass off to get the funds needed for efficient running of the club, only for it to disappear be given peanuts at the start of each and every season. It's annoying, cause no way I'm spending on this game, I'd rather download a cracked version if this isn't checked in the next update/version, tick tock lol. Try making the game more realistic as we the gamers, expect.",
      "Okay. The game has huge potential, it's really fun and I'm into it, but it has huge issues. The biggest issue is that it's pay to win. I played couple of seasons in different clubs and not once have I acomplished club goals!Not even to avoid regulation. The game is totally making you lose, no matter how hard you are investing and playing smart, you just lose unless you pay for boosts, which stops you from working in better clubs. When this issue is fixed, when game is balanced.",
      "Here is suggestion from me for players that having a hard time playing this game. Try using a lower tier club, set the playing style to your favorite, sign a free player with higher rate than your squad and staff with the same playing style ASAP, get rid any player that doesn't suit your playstyle or you can sell them to free the wage budget and get cash, spend any available fund for upgrade stadium facility. I've been using Aldershot, playing 4 season until now and get promoted every year 😊",
      "I like this game but it's needs serious attention and wisdom now I started season with Barcelona I won more than 40 La Liga league,Copa del Rey more than 20 times,More than 20 champions league and 1 Euro cup with Barcelona to be honest Premier league is more difficult league because any team can win league ,I spent 3 years in Premier ,I became Premier league runners up twice and I won Premier league once and league cup once,now I'm on year 2064,I have UEFA A certificate I haven't spent any money"

      "Great application! I use it across all of my platforms, seamlessly. Keeps me organized for my day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to year tasks. I can attach documents, pictures, etc for all tasks which is very useful. Before TickTick, I used Toodeldo. It was okay, but TickTick is just leaps and bounds better than Toodeldo. If you want and need organization in your life, TickTick is the application for you!",
      "The most intuitive app ever! Over the years I've tried numerous self-management techniques and apps, but this is the best by far. I love that it combines so many personal productivity functions in one, including Pomo timers, Kanban boards, habit tracker, smart reminders etc. Best by far is the minimalist, flexible calendar. The devs have done an incredible job! Update: Months later and I still love this and use it daily :)",
      "I'm not usually one to advertise, but SERIOUSLY, if you are looking to be more organized with your daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or random TASKS, then Tick Tick may be right up your alley. I downloaded it about a week ago as a suggested upgrade from the GTask Tracker app (which I liked a lot) and I absolutely love this app, for real!!",
      "The only real all-around solution out there. Great pricing. Desktop, mobile and Web. Markdown, subtasks, calendar, smart lists, tags, folders, sharing, countdown/duration/due dates. Pomodoro. Habits. This app has it all! I keep recommending it to my friends. Besides adding new functionalities, the only area were I sometimes get disappointed with the app is that from time to time you suffer synchronization issues with one task when managing it on multiple devices (eg. Android and Windows app)",
      "Not bad It's a basic to-do list which establishes days when a project is to be completed and a list of tasks that were uncompleted. Uncomplicated and useful. I would like to see the option that shows a job partially completed... some projects need to be held over and a more customisable repeat process ... every fortnight, or third Friday of the week."

      "It's good, but there's a lot of room for improvement. What I like: I can track vehicle maintenance such as tires, oil, vehicle repairs, etc., and get a feel for what the vehicle's actual cost per mile is. I love that there are reminders I can create. What can be improved: why is there no overall fuel economy average? Also, It would be great if I could create recurring reminders, by odometer and by date (check oil levels every 1000 miles, check tire air pressure every week, etc).",
      "Good for tracking money spent on car. Milage recording, so easy. Handle multiple cars, gas station online. Service recording and remainder is so good",
      "This app gets better all the time. Easy to use, clear simple process to keep track of your vehicle's fuel expense and mileage. Overall good value.",
      "Very good app to keep track of your routes and expenses, as well as keeping track of the fuel consumption.",
      "A one year user, and I've used it every week since downloading. It has the option to separate your individual vehicles so this made writing off my mileage and expenses on my corporate and personal taxes a breeze. It also gives me an indication of my mileage history so I know when I need to do maintenance. 50 star review"

      "We use this where I work, and it is more trouble than it's worth. It has to have decent internet to function at all, which is a problem when you're travelling. The in app pop ups cover up buttons, so you have to wait for the unneeded popups to go away to clock-in/out for instance. Make the app function offline, and when you're clocked in the app has a floating tile (like Messenger) that you can put away if you like.",
      "We use this app at my job and it gets stuck on a white screen or when I attempt to clock in, it tells me that I am not at the proper location. My signal has 5 bars and even with wifi, it does not load. It only works less than half the time. My coworkers with iPhones do not have this issue but all of the ones with androids do. I have a Galaxy Note 9.",
      "The app has alot of great features... when they work. My employer uses this app for scheduling and communicating with staff. While those are great features, the messenger component is almost ALWAYS down. This causes a breakdown of staff communication, as many messages are consequently missed, not received in a timely manner, or not able to be sent at all. This app has great potential, but features need to be accessible and functional.",
      "The app has been buggy, frustrating, and poorly arranged for as long as I've used it, however it at least used to work. Recently, I started needing this app again, and yet am unable to search for my workplace, as the entire app crashes moments after the auto search (after typing 3 characters) begins. I hoped this would be resolved in the update I just downloaded, but happens the same way every time. No matter what characters I type, it crashes before I can type a fourth, so completely unusable.",
      "Diabolical , your app is appalling , it constantly fails to load on all of my devices , my friends encounter the same problems regularly . The app throws you out of any app your in to bring you to the dashboard for no reason what so ever . It fails to complete the basic operations it should do . It is substandard compared to humanity. I am afraid this app requires a lot of work to make it even remotely usable it is rubbish It is rubbish"

      "Updated my rating to 5* because I was able to find all my past records for EACH category under Statistics>Reports. A very useful app. I now know: 1. How much I spent paying debts. 2. How much money I have in Total. 3. My biggest expenses and 4. I don't need to remember when a payment was made because everything is recorded in real time and easily retrievable. I'll buy the paid version. Thanks to the developer.",
      "2 major flaws... I would never pay $55 to unlock features to an app, much less one that wont even let us view ALL records within an account. All there is is 30 days, weekly, monthly, yearly and that's it. I mean.. no ALL option?!?! Really?!?! That's as simple as they come UPDATE* I emailed them and they responded with \"we are a non technical support team\" regardless if I could find a calendar view.. previous dates is not what I'm looking for... I want to see all data in an account.",
      "In the beginning I was amazed by the functions and graphics and planned to pay unlimited license, but trial changed my mind. The main issue is that sync with bank account happens only manually and takes several minutes :O next, the payments are not categorised well. I can't believe that even payments from global chains or popular shops are not recognized. For example Rohlik.cz always falls in Electronics. After all I need to make a lot of manual corrections and it makes tracking unpleasant. Update: The machine learning, never learns. I would prefer if you apply simple list of shops and categories to fancy machine learning if you don't know how to make it work.+ Banks sometimes don't connect for weeks and nobody repairs this until customer notice. I will definitively not continue with this *** another year. Thanks",
      "Decent enough free version, though there are a few problems. The biggest one for me is that the \"balance forecast\" appears to be counting my planned payments as positives instead of negatives - i.e. my landlord is paying me rent instead of the other way around. As a result the numbers are so wrong that it's almost comical. I have to use an excel sheet for this instead. There are a couple of things I wish were added too, like being able to separate expenses per day by category in reports.",
      "This is clearly the result of a competent team which cared about user experience. One annoying thing is that I \"can't delete record in connected account\". I'm tracking a bank account and two credit cards. It calculates all of the expenses from the credit cards twice - once for each purchase on the credit card statement, and then the monthly billing of the bank account as well. There should be a simple way to exclude a transaction from the statistics."

      "Worked great at first. Good visuals and easy to navigate and understand. As soon as my payment for the 6 month subscription went through, it stopped syncing to my bank account and displayed the wrong information. It won't re-sync properly and I've sent multiple emails to the support team with no response. Very dissatisfied.",
      "Decent app but the graphs are hugely inaccurate and very annoying. The peaks and troughs are in completely wrong places. Maybe you could have a data point for each day instead of the average type of graph you are doing at the minute? Also, my numbers keep on doubling for some reason. Some times it says my savings accounts are double, sometimes it says the amount I have spent in my budget has doubled e.g. I'm -200 instead of like 400 up.",
      "So far the app has been very helpful. I was able to spot that I was being charged by Amazon Prime incorrectly and could then put a stop to that. The UI is easy to use, if not a bit of an overload sometimes. Also, being able to set budgets for individual categories and having summaries of spending is great!",
      "Great app! I don't have a problem with debt. However what this app has shown, quickly, is that I was quite wasteful. It's described by some as childish, other than the jellybaby I don't see how. It's basic yes. Once you've set up all your direct debits, payments into categories, set your budgets etc. You're all set. You can see where to save in no time. Easy to use, easy to save. No brainer! Highly recommended. Worth spending the time to set up correctly...",
      "Expected way more ; UI : Wonderfull & beautifull. UX : Horrible, not intuitive except for budget. Cash : If you want to track your cash expenses you need pro and even there its not intuitive. Merchant & subscriptions : Really cool and work well, kind of a great idea. Missing sub-category, any analytic chart. Bugs : didn't detect bank fees, my cheking account was merge with my credit card as 1 account. There might be potential for the futur but right now \"Wallet\" from Budgetbakers is way better."

      "Fantastic games. But has a few problems. The transfer system is ridiculous. No clubs ever want to buy our players unless we transfer list them, and the money we get from player sales isn't much. Second, introduce the concept of loan. Coutinho is on loan at Bayern, but in the game he is their player. Third, why is there no concept of age? Zlatan being sold for ~70M, Huntelaar for 97M, simply ridiculous. And introduce retirements, and gradual decline of players with age. Then I'll rate you 5 🌟.",
      "👍🏻 great game. Authentic players as well. Transfers could use upgrading to have more control of who you can sign. The price to buy players is a bit excessive? Messi/Ronaldo is $400+. Only flaw is its missing a ton of players. Jack Grealish, James Maddison etc. Alot of players they can add. Overall awesome game guys💪🏻",
      "Its a really nice one but maybe i would give it 5 stars if i could study be able to go to a certain team and i offer them money for a player i want and also command like one of my to striker's to be like a finisher and then the other to play like the second striker, i mean like to give me the freedom to command and dictate the roles of my players",
      "Superd football manager game. But I wish the graphics will be upgraded in the next version. And also there should be separate leagues so that u can change teams in different leagues at a different country. But in all this game is loving. Everybody must download it.",
      "Best game but you need to improve the transfer process by adding contract negotiation between manger and players loan spell should be added as well add a fast sim game button and ballon dor awards for the best player and also increase the number of teams leagues and competion and also managerial position with contract negotiation"

      "Hands down the best project management application out there. 1) Easy to use 2) Attaractive interface 3) Multiple users interaction is really simple and effective 4) Fleet of features at your disposal for your business. It's definitely been a game changer for my agency ever since I started using it.",
      "I have been using this app for nearly 10years now and most of the improvements /updates are great. However, of late, I've realised that any task created defaults to 'private' which is a good thing I guess, except that, you can only change it to 'public ' by logging onto a pc which is not always practical :( - FAO: Asana inc, a fix to that would be perfect. Nonetheless, a very good app overall :)",
      "So far, not so good. I've used Asana on the desktop before and found it to be a powerful project management tool, but with the app I can't even log in. Neither via Google nor by creating a new account. Complaints of no Internet Connections occur no matter what network I'm on. What is happening?",
      "This app never gives the notification at right time. Always delays. Whenever I open the app, the notification pops up. It makes it more frustrating. O'wise UI was terrible anyways. My client has hundreds of tasks, if she comments on one, I can never figure out which one it is. Show some blowing dot on the task itself so that it stands out!! Dumbass!!",
      "I can't make it work in my phone. LAME!!! Only option is a \"magic link\" (not kidding!!!) via email, and when I open it on my phone email it ALWAYS says that the link is expired. When I open it on my desktop email, the \"magic link\" works, but not for the phone app."

Plus it keeps saying I've got no friends so I have to keep logging out of Facebook and back in. Is anyone having the same problems",
      "Used to be an enjoyable game but now frequently when making substitutions players are not where the should be. For example, forward was put in then when looked again was playing right wing back!! As other say, is obviously game designed for people who pay - seems odd whenever about to play a league rival the game before always have an injury or sending off. After three and a half years of playing am going to uninstall game.",
      "It is not easy for you to change your players on the field or make reservations",
      "Game is pay to win, no tactics involved if you have real money, still quite addictive and enjoyable in the lower leagues where you need tactics if you don't have the money.",
      "Wish i could give a good review but after spending an hour upgrading my team and hiring players ect. The game legitimately only let me have 1 game and then says i havr to wait until next season for more matches. Wish it made it clesr you dont progress by playing matches but on a seasonal/daily match basis"

      "great app. It would be good if you could mark a chore as complete even if it wasn't your turn. And then show who completed that task last. In case for example your flatmate doesn't do their chore but then they can see that you were the one who did it because it still had to get done.",

      "So the app works exactly as advertised, which is great. The things it does it does well. However a few features are missing that would really improve the user experience. When checking off things on the shopping list, I would want to be able to immediately have the option to add them as an expense. An option to cross off chores as done even if it's not ones turn, therefore ones next turn being skipped would also make things a lot easier. Plus a dark mode :)"

      "The developer email does 't work when I tried to make contact over a mistake I made in paying 2 times for the app. But the app itself is a 4 star only on the basis that deluxe premium paid customers should have the option of 3 locations. But I do love the app but it would do well with some more tweaking to benefit those who are willing to pay for it. Even to give a few more ultra apps. VPN is all over the place, and Datally is free. So I'd welcome a little more. But thanks Samsung!",
      "Makes you think it is an official Samsung app. When it is indeed made by a 3rd party developer. The so called \"premium\" mode puts ads on your lockscreen when charging. Thought I liked it when I first installed then slowly grew to dislike. Just uninstalled. Find a better VPN app and hopefully Samsung will actually make an official vpn app.",
      "i have to admit this is an amazing app, and for some reason i get premium for free wich means everything unlocked no monthly payments and no in app ads only when you are charging you get a different lockscreen with a small add on the bottom. that's my only negative ánd that you have to get used to the layout and what settings are located on wich tab but considering i got used to it realtively quick. i'd say this is the best vpn/datasaver.. out there i took a star off because ofc ads are a thing",
      "Not a bad app in general, puts a bunch of existing feature in one interface BUT the reason for 2 stars and uninstalling after I do review is, built in VPN block me from connecting with addresses i go to on a frequent basis. Legitimate sites with no questionable content. Have to minimize app, disconnect VPN , the go back and proceed. NONSENCE",
      "Installed it, seems good. The app drains a lot of battery very quickly. The connection with the app activated is slow. Please fix it. Also if you uninstall the app and install it again, it doesn't have a history log."

      "Excellent, well built file manager. Unfortunately doesn't seem to have a 'select all' tool so I can delete all the files in a folder--which is what I needed. Edit: Well, golly, it does have \"multi select\". (Tap the first check symbol twice--the one that selects a folder. A little obscure, but you can't have an icon for everything!)",
      "I'm going to sound like in gushing but i love this file manager. everything that is wrong with every other one has found a solution here. already selected 15 files but need to view one by without losing your selections, no problem. don't remember which side of the dual panes you're on? never here. the more time i spend with it the more i can't imagine my mobile without it. Edit: it's time for a GUI update. I'd love to try my hand at it. It's looking a bit dated, kinda like Win 95.",
      "GREAT APP #1 Very interesting and very fun to use, after a little learning curve (because there's just so much you can do). But once you figure it out its great. I've used allot of file explorers and managers... ES, google, superuser, ect. And i favor this one by far! Love the batch rename for just changing extensions! GREAT APP #1",
      "Just amazing, have tried tons of file explorer apps and although this one isn't flashy, it makes up for it by ease of use, simplicity, and awesome tools. If your sick of trying file apps that don't have exactly what you want get this, now! Trust me, your search will end here.",
      "I don't know what you are, but your app is genius! Men, there are two active areas in Norton manner, but one part hides aside until you tap on it. Very convenient and smart. A folder tree shows the entire file system instead of cut featured views. I'd call this FM a device organizer. Definitely, this is a must-have app."

      "Works great splitting Bill's with friends. Just went on a weekend trip with 2 other friends and we had to use 3 different currencies and juggle who owed what. Tricount made it very easy to sort out. I like that while someone is in the process of paying for something, I can add the bill to Tricount for them and we are both set as we leave.",

      "Great app, but my reporting period is 25th to 25th, so month by month doesn't help me. I need to report, especially budget wise, from the 25th to the 25th. I'm sure a lot of users might have similar \"non standard\" reporting periods. Can you guys maybe look at incorporating this as far as budgets are concerned? For example, the majority of my expenses for February will take place from the 26th to the 31st January, but they're allocated to January which skews the reporting.",
      "Bought the lifetime membership and been using it for about 4 years. Their backend service is great as I encountered some hiccups when I switch my phone cos I backup the data with the older version. They are very helpful to send me the file of the previous version in order for me to retrieve my backup data and update the data to the latest version without me losing any of my past data. Keep up the great work! Thanks.",
      "The devs are absent. Been waiting a couple of months for an email I've sent and no answer whatsoever, communication is something I find essential especially for an app that you pay a subscription (or buy the lifetime version since it has the option). The app is good, not great, and definitely not bad, but there are some things that they should work on. And if there is no communication from them it's safe to assume they just moved on and they will no longer respond or will make any mayor updates",
      "The best budget app ever in the app store 👌👍. I found a bit unprofessionalism from the developer. They simply disregard of your expectation from the app. I had the request of adding option of choosing any photo from gallery to be set as custom icon. They simply reject to be satisfied with the built in icons. Another request was to make any account to be excluded from total (there surely has the option but not working actually) so that I might use my office account in parallel but in vain.",
      "The app is beautiful but only in English. With arabic usage, I can't be able to add data as a new entry or new expense. I hope to develop the application in Arabic like the other languages that work in the application correctly."
