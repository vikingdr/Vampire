      "I like the app but it gets so annoying when I'm trying to save a place. It always goes to my 'saved places' and I can't get it to switch to 'want to go' or 'favorites.' I can't create any new lists either. I've tried searching up how to do it but unless I'm missing something, you can only do it on the regular Google maps.",
      "Functions well enough, but there's no way to sign out of your Google account like there is on regular Maps. There's an option to temporarily switch to the browser incognito mode, but it will quietly switch itself back out as soon as you change any other setting (showing the traffic map, for example). It's very low memory and featureful, but this is not privacy friendly.",
      "This app used to tell me street and freeway names - now it never says either, just \"turn right in 1000 ft\" (hint: use tenths of miles, which is what our cars use). Or \"take the interchange on the right\" when there may be several interchanges within the next mile. BIG step BACKWARDS, Google - way to go!",
      "Something that was good is now rubbish, what happened to google maps? It sucks at finding my location, it is slow and it trys to hard to be clever. Also putting the navigation feature on a different app feels like a dick move. Don't worry Waze is to the rescue.",
      "I'm not sure what happened to their algorithm but their estimated traffic and ETAs consistently make me late. Edit: this app is completely unusable. I have calibrated over and over and it cannot locate my location despite being hooked up to wifi and on high accuracy location setting. This is ridiculous."

      "♡ This app is the coolest, on point, Traffic Alert GPS Map out there. You get a heads up on what's going on and when it was reported, you can also give reports. I love it. It's fun. Real, live action. It's like we're a big family looking out for each other on the road. I never take a trip without my Waze! It's been on point like every time I've used it. It just keeps getting BETTER! But, the first time I run into some BS, I will MOST DEFINITELY update my comment i got here. But until then. 💯✔♡",
      "Waze, It is a great App, show the way to my destination. The App need a bit of improvement, it still not stable at times, easily disturb my other reception and can not function well, redirect wrong location, when come to location it does not show whether is on the left or right of the road, and slow on directions arrow pointing, mean poor in actual or specific location. Appreciate so much for your creation to help us enjoy our driving. Have a great day ahead! Thank you.",
      "This is a really good traffic map system. Its search system is limited, but it does have the benefit of being category-based, which is great when looking for gas or coffee on the go. The traffic and hazard warnings are SO useful. I'm also a big fan of it being integrated with Spotify and Pandora for music on the go. If the map is ever outdated, you can also suggest map corrections, and the team actually listens! Great app, so user-friendly, totally recommend it!",
      "Great app. The crowd sourced traffic data is great. The app can also find the nearest petrol station which is a life saver. *Update March 2020*. The \"submit fuel prices\" feature works fine now. Changing my review to 5 stars. The only draw back is the \"submit nearby fuel prices \" feature , which rarely works. It normally claims it can not find a GPS signal, even though other location based parts of the app are functioning fine.",
      "I love this app because its live and get smart updates. I would like the if they could please add a compass on the face of the map somewhere to give us the proper direction of what direction we are currently heading in. This is the only flaw I see with this GPS. Thank you. Please fix this. A compass on the face of the map somewhere. Thanks."

      "This is a really great app. I downloaded it expecting only 3D views but this app is so much more. And its best features I've liked so far is the voyager feature and now the app also includes a feature in which you can see the background stars and you can see the Milky Way. That might be my most favourite feature. Overall this app is all about exploring places without drones and with the convenience of holding the whole world in your hands. I would've liked it more if it had 3D of all states",
      "I LOVE the EARTH app! I can visit the streets of Stuttgart, Germany where I lived as a child and then soar over to Menemsha MA on Martha's Vineyard Island where I worked in my early 20s. Semi-circle routes around cities like Boston MA and Charlotte NC finally make sense to me and my new neighborhood has become familiar. This app is quick and detailed.",
      "Up until the last few months, this app worked smoothly. But its suddenly slow, freezing up and crashing. I keep removing it then installing it again but it's still not working good. When i try and move the map, it freezes and then moves slowly. It crashes a lot too. Its impossible to use.. A family member has reported the same issue on their phone. Please fix this issue..it never used to be slow and freeze",
      "I truly have no bias towards this Co. at all and have no reason to lie. This app is truely FANTASTIC !! Refreshing to find something that actually WORKS !! Only one little thing: Sometimes U might have to go back to the app and just give the vol. control a little up or down tikle. Otherwise it's GREAT!! DON'T MISS OUT.",
      "I use the app a lot. I haul a 16' trailer to work and use this app as a tool, I look up residential homes on my schedule for kitchen remodeling to see if there is sufficient parking or if I can unhook my trailer and leave it for the week,. The only downfall is my house is 5 years old and so is the image on the app. So I checked 1 day and it was updated, 3 days later it changed back to original. Should I be worried there's something near my acreage that we are not supposed to see? ????????"

      "The last few months the app seems to be broken.  When you're on a main road, it leads you to any path that's a few meters shorter, even if it's a lot slower (and yes, in the settings I chose for 'Fastest Route' and not 'Shortest Route'). Example: this morning I was on the highway going 100km/h. The app told me to exit the highway. There was a traffic light, so I had to come to a full stop and then wait. The app then told me to take the highway again. It became a 3-minute detour. Broken!",
      "After being let down by Google maps on both our devices and that making our trip 10 hours instead if 6. We downloaded this app to get us home. It started great and was accurate, we were very happy and we're making good time home. I'd even downloaded the extra Scotland map info. Then around 20 or so miles up the road and out of the blue it stopped working and left is stranded in the middle of no where. She was silent and not moving or getting a gps signal. We reset and nothing. Waste of time.",
      "This app looks simplistic at first uses while planing trips but then shows very nice features during navigation. I also like to set waypoints enroute. I tried this app to drive in Canada, Greece, Spain and France. It works really well unless you have small runabouts at every corners like in France, exit voice indication wrong too many times and obsolete speed limits too. Using it at other countries was really better. Any way to report things to update on map through this app?",
      "It's nice still have access to a map while driving in areas that don't have cell service because I don't have to pull off the road try and find my location in a map book I purchased in a gas station 20 years earlier and then try and memorize the route I'm supposed to take. Instead I can just keep driving with confidence.",
      "No longer what it was. This app is broken as it just keeps changing routes on my journey and now you have to pay for everything including hearing the direction??? Give me a break. Luckily there are other free ones that do much more. Sorry to but this waaaas a great app not anymore. I'm now going to uninstall it."

      "I used to live this app but this weekend it messed up a very important weekend and added an hour to my trip home late at night by taking me a longer route instead of the shorter route. When I tried to fix it so I could find it it wouldn't correct the problem. Added a whole hour to an already exhausting trip!! Also, made us late to an important competition in an unfamiliar city. I may go back to google maps. Used to love this one but it really messed up this weekend.",
      "Horrible. Once you reach one of destinations in a list, it keeps taking you back to precious ones. There's is no way to cancel a destination you have already arrived at. This was supposed to make my multiple stops route easier but i wasted more time turning around and reaching the maps on the side of the road. So, I tried to use it for the rest of my local trip. GARBAGE!!! Sometimes in life you need to deviate from the original plan. How about, \"continue route from current location\".",
      "Interface isn't intuitive. Adding stops is a complicated process, especially when trying to add a destination between the starting point and the final destination. Searching for categories of businesses yields points on the map that must be manually clicked and cycled through, rather than a list that can easily be navigated. Recalculating when deviating from the route is slow. The app will often think the user has deviated from the route when he hasn't, resulting in erroneous recalculation.",
      "Great experience. I really like that you dont have to open app to start your desired function. Instead, you can choose your desired function by placing your finger on the app ( on phone screen) leave finger on the app and secondary menu pops up. Then choose from driving directions, etc.",
      "The program works ok, but does not necessarily find the fastest route according to the parameters set and it does not work well outside the continent US such as Puerto Rico. It also does not use your current location well in determining where you want to go. ie. If in NY it does not necessarily list NY location first if location with a similar name exists in CA."

Grrrrrrrreat job 🤜💥🤛",
      "Have used the app frequently on our trips for off-line walking mode routes and worked well. Just in the last week of a weeks long European vacation it has started to lag badly. We start to walk the route and the blue arrow doesn't move and then it suddenly jumps to catch up. This is even when we are out in an open area on a street. This was a great app and we really depended on it especially to find our accomodations in the historical parts of towns. Used to be 5 stars for us.",
      "Would be a 5 star if it was possible to search through my bookmarks list to find a place. I have a list of over 16,000 locations throughout the country, only about 200 of which I use. It would be great if I could search for the places I need. I am using the Android version on my Huawei device",

We have revamped the route planner and route overview to bring you an intuitive and easy to use interface with all the necessary navigation information. We hope you&#39;ll find the new settings helpful!<br>You&#39;ll see that we have also redesigned the POI details to make the information about interesting places more approachable.",

      "It was really good app for car navigation, but with latest updates it is becoming less and less useful. App crashes few times in 25 kms. It takes you through longer routes with the same arrival time. It takes you through unpaved roads, even though there is paved road and much shorter. I do not understand monthly updates since we don't have toll stations in Slovenia for more than 2 years but it still shows speed limits as they were 2 years ago.",
      "My main complaint is whenever you are getting close to a turn or exit, it doesn't show the name of the street or exit. The voice says the actual name of exit/street but I don't always hear it so I have to rely on the arrows, which work OK if you're not on a highway. For example, if the directions tell me to exit i10 in 1 mile and there are 2 exits back to back, you don't know which one you should take without taking eyes off road. Features are cool tho but app needs improvement. Paid sub BTW.",
      "Last update ruined the good experience. Keeps on crashing very often, positioning is slower than before, autozoom is sometimes delayed, arrival time calculation became inaccurate, often plans unneccesary detours or strange turns without any reason. Worst was when it just shifted me to another route plan which I never confirmed! I really liked the app before, so I bought the extra options, but now I am really upset about it.",
      "The most comprehensive navigation system you will own for the foreseeable future at least. Absolutely hands down the very best group of apps that seamlessly integrate phone/tablet to your car. Without any question or hesitation, if you want the best navigation experience in your car get Sygic today.",
      "I'm using Sygic for over 10 years now and with this new release 18.5.3 it evolved to the best navigation app available. Even better then Google maps. The only thing missing is a functioning \"Lane Assistant\" which can be ignored because Sygic offers a superb \"Secondary Instruction Mode\". Therefore, I can honestly recommend Sygic as a cheap paid offline and online 5 Star navigation app."

      "Im a Pro User. I regularly Y export maps from ArcGIS and use this app for field data collection. I haven't upgraded to pro version yet with shapefile support, but am just fine with KML work arounds.",
      "If you don't like the new map store interface with NO free filter. You can switch back to the old map store Open Avenza Maps > Settings > General > Debug Settings > Avenza Map Store Settings > Map Store Interface > Legacy A giant thank you to the support folks at Avenza for proving this to me. *** Original Review *** This used to be a great app, but now Avenza has made it near impossible to find the free maps by removing the filter for free maps. In addition, they also redid the interface where you find maps to make it harder to find maps that cover small areas, but are highly detailed. FYI, the most of free maps come from government sources and were paid for by taxpayers like us. Shame on the US Forest Service, BLM and other gov't agencies who keep promoting this company and it's apps.",
      "The app works great for the maps that are installed when we're on the trail. I just wish we could also look at them online or something, to make planning easier. Planning on my phone is tedious and I shouldn't have to buy a tablet just to access maps I've already paid a decent price for.",
      "Search for maps in Store just became MUCH MORE CUMBERSOME in 3.8.2 build. Please revert to previous behavior! Pressing Store button used to return me to search results from my previous Store visit, helpful when downloading several maps for a region for trip planning. Now I must (1) reset the Location (now defaults to current location every time!), (2) reset the Keyword search field, AND scroll thru a potentially long list of maps to get to the spot I last previewed/downloaded, so I may continue.",
      "This is a fantastic app that I use for horseback riding. Sometimes trails are not that easy to find when out in the wilderness and Avenza Maps makes it easy to be sure I am on the correct trail. It is very easy to use and works in airplane mode so does not drain phone battery."

      "This software has gone from top of my list to the bottom. It does not work on Xiaomi mi 9T Pro (Android 10/MIUI 11) It only shows \"Waiting for GPS\" intermittently, and does not start. At the same time, on the same place, on the same phone, 5 other navigation apps work flawlessly. Really a shame because I used it for 10 years, on various devices, and now it does not work on my new phone..",
      "I use Here Wego most of the time. Everything works well offline with the downloaded maps. If I miss a turn the app recalculated the route quickly. I especially like the speed limits warnings if I go above the speed limit, this is about 98% accurate I consider this to be good. I don't like to speed or pay speeding fines 🙂",
      "The app needs to say names of roads and highways. During the voice instructions, the GPs and only says turn right or take exit in X meters. At least give the feature where the voice by voice instructions says the road name. The GPS also fails to identify whether the location is on the left or right. Other maps indicate that the location is for instance on my right, but Here Maps does not. Add these features please.",
      "I really liked this previously,but it no longer works for navigation. Cant seem to access GPS but still tries to give directions even though it doesn't know where it is. Google maps navigates normally but Here we go doesn't work",
      "Hi. The last update messed up the starting point. Location is on and apparently I'm over 4000 km away when I put in my home address. Please fix. Other than that, i used this app on my nokia n95 and later on my n8. Very happy about the Android version. Best and reliable gps app for offline use. Keep up the good work."

      "It found an address that was very similar to mine. However it was all the way downtown in parts u don't want to be in late at night. That's the problem with having the same name for two different streets. The reason I blaming the app is because it should have based it's decision on previous demographics.",
      "The Compass is too small(and stays Toooo small-not resizable by option or otherwise, and when I hit the Arrow it turns, and it dissapears(It doesn't help because it doesn't stay, and is tooooo small to easily see, and the Map doesn't continue to orient per my phone's positioning. What good is a Compass that doesn't show the way? Please add the Compass back to the maps, and and make it also that the user can move the display when needed to another place on the map, and also hide when needed.",
      "I am perturbed. Google Maps came with my phone and now it hogs memory doing nothing. This is a waste of my memory on this Samsung phone. Now I have shell out more memory to install Maps Go and this necessary Navigation app to receive turn by turn directions. Awful and illogical. App works fine but I was slammed into this. I am not a happy camper when I get slammed into something. Awful and rotten. Kicker...bank app says no navigation apps found, 12/28/2019."

      "One big problem This is an excellent app for displaying a wide variety of different maps. One serious negative is that it won't let me zoom in enough to read the labels. I can momentarily pinch zoom in, but as soon as I let go it snaps back out so i can't read it again. Why? Seems like an arbitrary restriction that greatly reduces the usefulness of the program.",
      "Love this app though maps are a bit complicated at first. Shows areas that other maps only give blank screen. Plus i can make my own routes and keep coordinates if ever in an emergency.",
      "The map has good topographical information, and some old roads that can be handy to know about.",
      "It has nice maps. But I let it track me down to the road which is 150 feet. I forgot and left it on and was just in the house. When I checked the path it was huge! I'd estimate my house is 200 yards x 200 yards... If only!",

It doesn't tell you which lane to be on, prior to getting to an on-ramp, so you end up missing the on-ramp. There are times when the app will put you on an endless loop, if you allow it. So evil.",

There's no navigation app available that's as accurate,which doesn not do the same thing(sales of your info).There's apps which bosses of companies tell you to buy,because of 'X, Y, & Z...' but they're not nearly as accurate in real time navigation.There's an app nitch for developers!!!",

Navigation no longer has settings, no longer opens to screen with my list of contacts addresses, or a place for my home and work, favorites, etc. It doesn't really do anything except open Google maps. i don't need it for that.if you can help me oil change back to a 5 star"

      "I gave OsmAnd five stars for two reasons: 1) This is a great app. I use it for hiking and MTB and it has helped me find my way on numerous occasions. 2) The support is good. When I upgraded my phone I thought I had lost the use of OSM Unlimited and the contour lines plug-in that I had previously purchased. OSM support worked through the problem with me and it is all working now.",
      "The existence of Open Street Map is wonderful, and this app is a very useful interface for OSM. I've been using it for some years. I like to use it to track hikes for milage and route, and to see what points of interest (POI) are around, and I've used to navigate while driving when I didn't have mobile signal (e.g. in central PA and in Canada).... There are many options, which can be difficult to navigate at first, but you'll come to appreciate all the options.",
      "I have used it for about a week now. In my car and on my motorcycle. The interface takes some time to get used too. There is a lot of information displayed in a very good, common sense way, but still a lot of info. That said, the navigation screen should have an option to display the map in a tilted almost 3D view, like Google Map does it. And the icon for the car or MC should be in the lower part of the screen, not the center. Other than that, awesome app.",
      "These are open source maps, so not every business is listed, but you can save and organize locations. When I find a place that I want to remember, but isn't listed in the app, I mark it as a favorite. I love the fact that it offers navigation for walking, biking, and public transport. Great for English language Android users in Beijing.",
      "An amazing navigational app and location search tool! I love that I can see opening and closing times for places that have them updated on OSM. The interface is a bit daunting and takes a bit of practice/research to understand, but the online documentation for OSMAnd is wonderful as well, and after that learning curve it's an incredibly powerful tool. I use it any time I travel, and also to double check any updates I make to OSM!"

Lost that phone and now have a S10+ and the area at the top and bottom has been greatly reduced. when you are driving the route that has been laid out it would be nice if the driving route would follow along with your vehicle so that you don't need to keep swiping the screen to keep the vehicle being showed on the screen.",

      "Was working ok until today. No longer get voice prompts, speedo on screen, or other useful info. I used it for deliveries. It's useless now. I use it on a Samsung Galaxy J7 Crown running Android 9. Before the update I had an option to enter a destination & receive vox prompts to nav to it. Now all I can do is enter by vox and get no prompts even though it is called Voice Navigation. It has changed totally. I can only try to follow a bug on the selected route & hope I make the turns."

      "So I'm writing a second review since I cant reply to your response. I did contact your company. I was told in a year or so. It might be fixed. Here's my question that I asked your help department. Why when you have a program that has picture and GPS functionality does your error reporting page NOT allow you to use these tools to report errors. Instead asking for a written description of the \"issue\". I can hike and photograph boundaries much easier than I can write you a verbal description?",
      "This app works pretty well most of the time but I bought the app so my hunting partners and I can share waypoints with each other. When they share waypoints with me, they come through 5-8miles off from the point they are sending. Most other features I've used have worked pretty well so far. Edit- the developers got back to me quickly and were able to troubleshoot the problem. Great app",
      "In general a great app, but it has bugs on Android phones which the developer promised to fix ,but has not. For instance, if you tap on a particular parcel to see its boundries it brings up many other green lines showing the boundaries of surrounding properties or just random lines that mean nothing. It renders that important part of the app useless on Android phones. They have promptly fixed the problem.",
      "Worked great the first couple of time I used it so I upgraded to my state's premium so scout some public land. But as soon as I started adding a decent number if waypoints and photos the app kept crashing, not syncing between devices, and severe lag. Their tech team told me they are working on a fix but it's been 3 weeks now.",
      "I'm liking it alot but I'm now experiencing the property lines not showing up when I go into the app even after I bought the subscription, thought maybe it needed to update but it doesn't need an update so just waiting to hear back from onX at this point other then that I like it."

This should really be the main objective now: user feedback! If you listen to the users you will succeed! I have already sent you quite a bit of feedback but have not heard back. What is the best address for this? Additionally, I see you write we get 75km free each month, but when I start the app, it does not offer this at all? It only offers paid subscriptions?",
      "Updating my review, really love the new update, better lane assistance, can open Google maps link's and be set has default navigation app Routing is far better than Waze or Google maps , and the new select witch offline maps you want saves me time no more swapping map's manually in short all my previous issues we're fixed with new version Suggestion: in city lane assist and habilty to save trip data like road's taken time and average speed",
      "I used to champion this app having been using it for week over 2 years. However, I have been in stationary traffic several times over the past couple of weeks for prolonged periods on major roads yet TomTom has not picked up on it. Really disappointed",
      "Currently my old SG 7+ has the 2.0.7 update version, it's frustrating to use a small screen especially that I can not get it on my SG Note 10+ When is the gorgeous long awaited update coming...?",
      "The app is glitchy glitchy glitchy , when you subscribe 9 times out of 10 ( especially when you need it ) you open it and it says that your subscription has ended , and wont let you proceed , very annoying and really quite useless . You can never contact the help team etc . Just about unusable , google maps is now my default navigation app , incredibly infuriating when you have paid for a subscription ."

      "Good sat nav, system updates via Google play store now sorted at last. Still one of the best free sat nav's out there, either on or off line.",
      "No longer working correctly. When I type in to do a search and attempt to enter a town or post code, the app crashes and restarts. If I tell it to navigate to an address I already have saved, it thinks I'm about 2 mile away and therfore out of sync with the roads. Never had a problem until now. Reinstall hasn't worked. A shame as this was great in its day.",
      "At a basic level it works very good. But the issue is with searching for a house or apt number. If I search for a house/apt number it will not allow that without bring up the sad face logo indicating no results?Then when I search again I find the street name ok, but as soon as I enter the streets house/apt number eg 5 it brings up no results and the sad face? This is no good to me because I need to navigate to the correct house number on the street rather than just being navigated to the streets entry? Also when I go to places of interest and look for them in my local town it does not bring up my towns facilities for navigation only nearby towns facilities of 20 miles away or more? My question is am I doing something wrong or is it because i’m using the free maps? and not the optional paid maps? If that is the case should I upgrade to the paid maps? Any help would be appreciated and I am willing to donate.",
      "Version 5.0.63 appears to be the last really stable version. Latest update seems to have many bugs, causing crashing and freezing. The lack of Google search is also a downside. UK and Spain map updates have been sparse lately. Reply: I had already done as suggested. I have installed vers. 5.0.63 again and have no issues. I shall stay on that version for now untill the bugs in the latest version are fixed.",
      "Great app. 1st time I used it was when we arrived late at Faro Airport, Portugal. Usual confusion of hiring a car and driving on the other side of the road was compounded by the fact that it was now dark with a 2 hour drive ahead into unknown countryside. The app worked like a dream and didn't have to worry about mobile data with the map already downloaded to my phone. Arrived at hotel without mishap after some seamless navigation. Only minor gripe is UK speed camera data not fully up to date"

      "The app is fine but don't buy the pass! They say its unlimited travel, but they charge you fees for taking buses. Happened to me twice. Also everytime you think you've been charged incorrectly, they want you to check your TFL account and then send a screenshot and then wait for a refund, its too much effort for very little upside. And they increased the fares too starting 2020. Although I really recommend using them for the maps, the UI is great and it's never crashed for me.",
      "This is by far the best map navigation app I've ever used. I do however have a couple of request... the movable icon needs to be in the precise direction you're facing, like an arrowhead icon. It's a bit frustrating if I'm trying to go to 10th Avenue in NYC when the icon is pointing in the opposite direction. Also, it would be greatly beneficial if the app gives you a warning if you're heading in the wrong direction. Just my two cents.",
      "This app seems to be getting worse by the day. One of the main problem is that the app decide where you want to start. And when it does change to previous location ( why on hell would you want to start from a place you WERE instead of the place where you ARE?). But it also decides itself. Like today I was at dalston junction, but the app insisted for me to walk to Angel statiom,. Then it offers me my previous location. But never suggested to take the train at the dalston station.",
      "I took the regular route with my road bicycle it showed me a mtb route along the way... I end up pushing my bicycle for about 2km because I'm too lazy to search for alternative route. It's good if you could add your own way point for bicycle route. Some of the PCN in Singapore is undergoing improvement and redevelopment so we can plan our own short cuts.",
      "It used to be simply the best transport app. No longer, unfortunately. The timings are not so accurate anymore and sometimes they don't even load. This applies to Madrid specifically. I used it in London also and it was fantastic."

Shows guesthouses, petrol stations etc not available on other mapping apps. The roads are up to date unlike a popular search engine's maps. For a free app it's outstanding.",
      "Its a nice app, that shows better router routes than the most famous app. But on my android phone I can just start from \"my location\". So I can't really plan for more than one day cycling. I can't check the route/distance between two different locations that aren't mine. Will you fix that? I know on ios you already made it. Then you get 5 stars",

      "Good maps but missing major features. I have really enjoyed this app so far for the most part but as I am diving deeper into it I am finding that the missing map legends is really a big problem that I cannot get around. I know that it is like 5 levels deep in a sub menu but I can't interrupt my map searching every time I come across something new without getting super annoying. I also need it to be downloadable so I can view it off road. Last year they said they would fix soon but nothing yet...",
      "Best map app hands down! Thank you for continual improvement and for making the paid version affordable. The annual fees are well worth the premium benefit of using this simple and effective app. I've been using it for 2 years now and am continually impressed by your additions. I even used it in Europe over the summer :) 2020 update: I love this app even more. How is this possible? Updates, added functionality with layers, support. You guys rock! Keep up the good work 💪",
      "Awesome idea, can't seem to execute right. Great map app when it works right, which is about 50% of the time. Incredibly frustrating when it doesn't load maps that are already downloaded or doesn't load layers properly. Update after update they claim to be addressing the issues with zero improvement. Will not be renewing my subscription. Would rate 4-5 stars when it works, but an offline GPS app that struggles to load cached maps is pretty useless to me.",
      "Hi..I got the Gaia GPS and even purchased the membership. The idea was to use the GPS to search for coordinates and drive to that location. We normally use DD MM.MMM format and so far I'm unable to input these directly into the Gaia search box without first converting it into either DD.DDDD or DD MM SS. What's the point of excluding one format from the search menu while the settings let's me choose all 3 position formats? This is kinda misleading. I think I'll request for a refund.",
      "Near meh? There is no good trails near me I need to be able to look at a map and see trails an hour or two in the distance, is that something you didn't think of when creating this expensive application that is actually a piece of chit? Lol Nice oversight retard Not showing/recommending Any trails on the map. This app is completely dysfunctional, useless. I didn't think you could get worse than \"AllTrails\" aka ALL FAILS, but I guess things can always get worse."

      "[IMPORTANT BUG] Theres this problem on newer samsung phones, for example on my galaxy a40. When taking photo spheres, even if you hold the phone still, the picture slowly moves to the left by itself. I guess the software thinks you are moving your phone? So by the time you try to take a full 360 photo, every row of photos is offset by a lot from the previous. How do I know this is a software issue? Because the same thing happens on other galaxy a40s and works just fine on a galaxy a5 2017.",
      "I am trying to add more photo spheres and connect them manually, but the user interface is very complicated and makes no sense. I have imported the 70 360 photos/ they are for some reason divided into different groups. Why. I want to see all the photos I have uploaded in a list, with file names (so I know how to connect them). Also I have found no solution to connect them before publishing. I am able to publish only group-by-group, and not all at once. In conclusion: the photo sphere contribution feature is very complicated and a total mess UI wise. There should be a desktop solution to make virtual tours because it is very hard on a tablet/phone.",
      "I love exploring the world with this app. additional features that would make me happy: 1) ability to bookmark views that I like so that I can revisit, 2) display details of the location (link to wiki perhaps), 3) location labels like on google map (or maybe I'm dumb and dunno how to set this?) 4) a \"back\" button, because when I accidentally touched the screen, I couldn't go back to what I was looking at before, and it's impossible to find it again and I have missed it forever.",
      "Incredibly buggy app. I have tried it on 3 phones and with the Theta v which is it suppose to support above all other 360, and it can barely function. 3/4 of my mappings end up garbled by the app and unable to upload or be published. Could be great, but it sucks :(",
      "It's useless for taking photospheres because when you're taking the pictures the preview slowly moves to the left away from the dots even tho im holding my phone in a still position. So the app thinks that every picture is in the right spot but in real life its completely offset from the previous. This is not a hardware issue as this problem appears in other phones. I thought this was gonna get fixed soon :("

      "I create a lot of maps, and the android experience is quite frustrating. It nearly always goes to some point that I've not specified as my default, and never remembers where I was when app switching. Also, GPS only works sometimes, and zoom level is rarely remembered. Often I end up on my laptop, but that's not possible when out and about",
      "UPDATED: Lacks many features (eg., edit icons, colors, rearrange POIs between layers) that the web interface can do. Would be better with more features plus ability to download as offline map. PREV: Overall, it's an ok app for viewing and making maps and basically identifying sites, hiking paths, whatever, but it needs an upgrade in features to really get the job done when you're on mobile.",
      "I give you one star because this is a failure to make a 'useful' app. I made a map of important trip points and now that I'm on the road I can't use the points to get directions. I deleted directions from my saves map at home because they didn't have traffic notes. What I'd like is a simple way to get directions from a mapping app. One where I saved the points. Otherwise it's just pretty not functional.",
      "Computer platform has an incredible amount of editables! Mobile platform is limited in what it can do. Use mobile platform while out in the field, plotting details of work. Finalize works with Computer platform. Google My Maps can support business related works freely.",

Often times the line just randomly disappears and you have to reopen the map file multiple times to get it back. Excellent concept, absolutely trash implementation."

      "Having a bit of a problem with it. Techs working on it, that does not discount the amazing amount of information that you can really use on this App, the Support Team got on the job of trying to fix whatever i did wrong so I hope to have the full capabilities back, like the day I started.",
      "Ok, so I have gave base map another try. I will say it has improved but still fails to compete with on x as far as performance goes. I continue to have issues with maps being slower to load than onx and I have had problems with the tracking mode to not work properly. All the while onx worked with out a hiccup. One thing I would suggest is to remove the big OFF GRID yellow header there appears on the maps. A thin yellow lined box is effective.",
      "I currently have a subscription to all of the well known map service apps. I have to say this app seems to be the most well rounded as far as features, detail, clarity, and ease of use. Also the gear drop feature is very entertaining! However there are a few features that are missing or in my opinion seem lacking. The biggest issue being you cant switch from topo to satellite via a hot button on the map screen. Seems silly but it's very annoying! Also the 3D feature leaves a lot to be desired.",
      "I really enjoy this BaseMap app. The Gear drop game is fun and has me doing hours of research and continue to talk to my friends and family about it. I would like to see where the winners of the week placed thier markers. It's fun and my kids are wanting to go to these places dad keeps looking for on the map.",
      "So far so good. Have used onX for years now. I heard of issues in offline mode so ill try a while before letting onX go. ill be trying this weekend in the woods. Ive noticed slightly grainy resolution when zoomed way in but not too bad. The photo of my house shows a car that has been gone 2 years in my driveway. This concerns me for e scouting. But the geardrop and the layers are cool. Ill keep it and hope for fixes on those issues. I like the photo waypoints and sharing.5 stars if those get fix"

    "description":"Measure Map Lite lets you quickly and easily draw polygons and measure distances, perimeters and areas over Google Maps and many other map sources with laser sharp precision.  It even takes into account the curvature of the earth’s surface. Use it for small areas or large, then share your findings via any sharing app on your device.\r\n\r\nYou may be an architect, a sports enthusiast or a geography hobbyist. It doesn't matter why you have a keen interest in accurate distances, it just matters that you have the tools to satisfy your need to know them. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s what Measure Map is for, to put a powerful, portable measuring tool right in the palm of your hand. Your Android device can now provide you with totally precise measurements of any distance, from as small as a meter to as big as thousands of kilometers or miles, even taking the curvature of the earth’s surface into account when measuring. It does all that, fast and effortlessly. \r\n\r\nYou don’t need a degree to take advantage of what Measure Map offers. Just drag the cross-hair, plunk pins in to mark the area you want measured and – boom! It’s done. Easy, right?. The \"Magic\" button allows you to input points more easily without losing it's professional accuracy. \r\n\r\nThe app measures any distance, route, or area you want, over Maps. Want to calculate your drive on the golf course, or maybe find out the distance of that marathon you’re thinking of entering? Go ahead. Need to know the size of a parcel of arable land for your company? You can do that, too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe restrictions of the Lite version are: \r\n* You can only create one polygon with a maximum number of 6 pins.\r\n* No shapes: Cannot create a circle nor a rectangle.\r\n* No extra maps.\r\n* No Track Button.\r\n* Only loads MMP files.\r\n* Ads.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheck out the impressive features you get in Measure Map: \r\n* Extra Maps: You can purchase Bing Maps, Here Maps, Arc GIS, World Street Map, MapBox, Open Street Map, Open Cycle Map, USGS Maps and Yandex Map in one package in the same app. NOTE: You need to upgrade to Measure Map Pro to be able to purchase this feature.\r\n* Attractive, smooth, easy navigation and use\r\n* Elevation Profile and altitude of a route.\r\n* Displays Maps View: Map, Satellite, hybrid and terrain \r\n* Operations: Add, delete intermediate pins, insert between pins, move pins, get info \r\n* Undo and redo operations as needed \r\n* Search for current location, text (villages, places of interest, etc.) or an area or route \r\nWorks for Metric and Imperial measurements \r\n* Length units: meters, kilometers, feet, yards, miles, nautical miles, ken, ri, bù, lǐ,  link, chain.\r\n* Surface units: square meters and kilometers, area, hectares, square foot, square yards, square miles, acres, fanegas (Valencian, Castilian or Colombian), tsubo, bu, so, lí, mǔ \r\n* Ability to select color and thickness of the perimeter line. \r\n* Ability to select the color and transparency of the selected area. \r\n* Exporting formats: Measure Map, KML (G00GLE Earth), CSV (Excel), Image (PNG) and PDF \r\n* Export and import of surfaces and routes via your storage services account. \r\n* Save to photo album.\r\n* Download surfaces and routes from the Internet. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf precise measurements are important or interesting to you, this is the app you need.

      "Very helpful map in Korea . I want to give it 5 stars , but i gives 4 , because I'm a Motorcycle Rider , this app send me to Highways a lot . Which is not good at all . In korean law , motorcycle riders can't go in highways . I've already setup my settings on app that i have motorcycle , but still sometimes, not all times , sometimes i find myself in highway. Otherwise , this app is very good . I love it .",
      "I absolutely love the app. I find it more intuitive than Google maps and being able to see the buses move on the map in real time is amazing. I wish Kakao maps covered other countries! Some parts of the app (for example the notices) are still entirely in Korean, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5/5.",
      "As a foreigner this app is extremely helpful. I use it for driving navigation, bus and subway routes and general location services. It has an English setting so there is no worry about understanding (or misunderstanding) Korean!",
      "App was great until the latest Android update where it now the only location permissions you can select for it are to disable or only allow while the app is running which breaks the feature which tracks your ride while on public transportation.",
      "While the menu is in English, everything else is ONLY Korean: Location names, what kind of train to take, how to walk etc. Completely useless if you can't read Korean, which is shocking as a tourist."

      "I liked it a lot for awhile. much more detailed, accurate and comprehensive than Google Map, by miles! until lately the directions all over the place and tonight, out of no where my anti virus app stopped it from working, somethin mg dodgey going on.",
      "Don't be scared of this app if you don't read Chinese. Google Maps stopped showing me bus routes and Baidu isn't on Google Play. This app shows approaching buses, fares, traffic jams and much more than Google Maps. A bus logo next to the number 8 is easy to understand. I will keep this even if Google Maps revive their display of buses. On a whim, I typed \"bar\" into the search box and this app showed me half a dozen bars. If I used my translation software and typed 酒吧 instead, it would do more.",
      "The app is very good, but commercial is too too too annoying!!!!",
      "it has all the information you could ever need in a map app. it is all in chinese, which isnt too bad if you know a bit of chinese and have pleco. but the biggest drawback is that the app uses so much ram to load all of its advertisements! it is so bad that if you phone is more than 2 years old id recommend not updating the app anymore because each new verdion requires more and more ram!",
      "Having used this APP more than three years, it is awsome. The real-time traffic information helps a lot to plan the route, particular in peak hours. With the most updated nav data, it is accurate both for route and time estimation."

      "I've been using this app for years and it is an essential piece of kit when I am hiking in areas without service. This is not a fire and forget app, but rather a nicely designed interface for displaying maps and tracks that you download. Ie open street maps. Therefore, a little planning is required by the user to get setup ahead of time, but it is well worth it.",
      "Thanks for the reply. The default backup is very annoying every day. Good thing it can be turned off. Generally I like the app. Just sometimes the GPS tracking will be off in the background even if I turn on the option to keep GPS tracking and run Locus Map as service.",
      "Its rare to find an app that is so good. Even the trial version is packed with features.",
      "So Far so good. At least I can import a GPX for a route, unlike Strava. I am using the Active watch app as well. So far I haven't figured out why it didn't record or use the heart rate information. If I could find this fix online I'd definitely upgrade my rating.",

Kudos for great gps software at a very reasonable price.",

    "description":"Custom Maps makes it easy to create GPS maps from map images, and those maps can be used anywhere, even when you have no data signal for your Android device (it works on both phones and tablets).\r\n\r\nCustom Maps can use photos of paper maps or brochures, and pictures of maps posted at trailheads or at the entrances to amusement parks. It can also use .jpeg or .png images downloaded from the internet and screenshots of PDF maps.\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is choose two (or more) matching points that are common to both the map image and Google Maps, and Custom Maps can then show your GPS location on the map. Data connection is required at the time the map is calibrated (created).\r\n\r\nAs the map images are stored on the phone, Custom Maps works offline without data signal. This is useful if you go hiking in national or state parks, and it can help you avoid international roaming charges abroad.\r\n\r\nCustom Maps can use almost any map image, including photos, as GPS maps so it can be a helpful map application when visiting zoos and amusement parks which typically post large maps of the park layout at the entrance of the park. Just take a photo of the posted map, line it up with Google Maps, and you can see your location on the map photo wherever you are in the park.\r\n\r\nCustom Maps can show the distance from your current location to a point on the map, so it can give you an idea how far different points are. This is especially useful for golfers who could create their own GPS maps for golf courses they play.\r\n\r\nCustom Maps uses simple image files for maps so you can add your own markup on the maps in a graphics tool (not included in Custom Maps) or draw entirely your own maps. Created maps can be shared using email from the app itself, or by hosting the map on a web server and posting QR codes for others to scan to trigger downloading of those maps.\r\n\r\nCustom Maps supports displaying placemarks on the map (starting in version 1.3.0). Placemark editing is not supported in Custom Maps itself (will be supported in a future version), but placemarks can be added in Google Earth. To add placemarks to a map, copy the kmz map file from phone to desktop computer, and open it with Google Earth. Create a folder in Google Earth containing the map overlay and add placemarks to the same folder. Then export the folder from Google Earth as kmz file, and copy back to phone.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Custom Maps app does not come with any maps included. The help menu for the map listing contains a link to www.custommapsapp.com website where you can download some sample maps to try. However, the best way to try Custom Maps is to take a photo of a paper map (or of an online map displayed on your computer screen) or download a map image from the web to your device, and then use Custom Maps to create a GPS enabled map from it.\r\n\r\nNOTE: On some devices, newly created maps don't show up in map list until the user returns back to map list from normal map display or after exiting and restarting the app. This seems to be an issue only with very few Android versions on specific devices, in most versions newly created maps show up immediately after they are created.\r\n\r\nNOTE: You can sign up to be a beta tester for Custom Maps at https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.custommapsapp.android. Same page allows you also to leave beta testing. If you try out the beta version of the app, please send an email to custom-maps-users@googlegroups.com telling me what device and OS version you tried it on, and whether the beta version worked for you.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information about Custom Maps at the application web site http://www.custommapsapp.com/.\r\n\r\nCustom Maps is an open source project.

      "Very useful app as a taxi driver. I made whole London and if I have to be in a certain area just turn it on. The only problem the app doesn't support large files so it reduces the quality of the file I use. Hope it will be fixed",
      "It works exactly the way it's supposed to. Pick points on your map you can also find on Google Maps, line them up, and accept them. If you have internet data access, you can also view the map you've created on Google Earth. One always wishes one could have more. For example, a user might know the coordinates of points from his GPS receiver and it would be a convenience to input the points instead of depending on Google Maps. Also, it would be valuable to see track points plotted on the map, as one sees on GPS devices. Until such an app exists, this is the best one I've tried.",
      "Very easy and intuitive to use. Please pretty please put a geo tracker, and it would be perfect. Works with pdf maps. Marko thanks for the prompt reply. I don't know how to use the custom map with a different geo tracker app. I really would like the ability to see my track on your custom map app. Another way would be to convert the custom map into a .kap or .bsb file so I can use Opencpn to create tracks on the .kap map",
      "Excellent app! allows you to import an image of any map, easily georeference it, and this use with your gps to show where you are on the map. limitation: wont import PDF or TIFF -- only JPG",

      "This was a great app but it no longer has a way to download maps for online use. The website instructions for doing so, from 3 weeks ago, describe menu choices that don't exist in the app. I'm sick of having to relearn how to use this app after every update. A gps app you can't rely on is worse than none at all.",
      "Your idea is good but your maps are years out of date. My house was built in 1953 and doesn't even show. On Satellite view it doesn't show the new house built next door 5 years ago.. even Google earth shows that !!! Nice try.",
      "I like this app as it encourages me to explore new experiences which I can easily share with others. I also enjoy that I can go back and revisit many of the walks - I use viewranger as a comprehensive log of my walks, with notes, pictures and observations. It's also great to have ratings and feedback from others.",
      "Ive been using viewranger for quite a time and I've found it to be a great app. I've used it on both IOS and Adroid finding and learning the difference in use, I've contacted helpline a few times and found this to be a very good.helpline have been very quick in responding to my questions and I have been able to follow their response instructions . Many thanks. I am learning a little more about it continuously. It fits me needs and requirements and I am building up a good selection of maps",
      "The app is good overall, has better functionality than the OS maps app, but could be a lot easier to use for the price. It is particularly good to be able to purchase and use Harveys maps. Various features are hard to find and plotting routes is glitchy on my phone."

      "Pretty good app for various types of riders and terrain. Would be awesome if it gave me voice commands or a display on my Casio smart watch which I have the app for. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is the membership cost. Maybe if I was doing different routes often it would be worth it but not for just finding the quickest commute via bike.",
      "Its okay. Need to add permission for allowing app to operate with location while in the background. If you switch to another app like music or messages it loses its place until you switch back to it.",
      "The application maps will not cancel your free trial subscriptions in any way in order get the money, it's a fraud and unfair to do that, you should not offer trial period if there is no refund.",
      "I've tried Komoot and Ride but no one else except Bikemap seems to have all of the cycle routes in London on. The route it chose me to go to work is fantastic, cycle routes the whole way. Komoot sends me down the A2 which might be a little bit shorter but it's a horrid ride. It's a very smart app. But battery heavy but worth it.",
      "After installing the app I can't do anything without either signing up with my Google, Facebook or email account. Not even browsing the map while connected to wifi. I find this not acceptable and therefore cannot recommend this app to anyone."

      "This is an update to my previous review, so a total re-write is in order. ------ At first, I had many problems making this app work on my Android 5.1 phone. The developer was kind enough to answer my inquiries with helpful suggestions. That is unusual for a Play Store app! At this time, the app is working very well on my phone, despite its antiquated operating system. ------ The application is quite fun to use and, for the most part, very easy to figure out. It's truly offline. You don't even have to have Data or WiFi turned on, but you do have to pre-download the maps- of course.It also respects you choice of GPS settings. Some apps change it to High Accuracy, or whatever. This one leaves your choice alone (battery saver for me). --------- Maps download compressed, so download is fast & uses little Data. Then, the automatically de-compress off line if desired. -------- I enjoy the Distance marking feature as well a being able to have (and edit or delete) many Favorites. I'm mighty lousy at pinch-zoom, so having Plus & Minus buttons for zooming is a well appreciated addition to the pinch-zoom capability. The maps, when zoomed way in,are still easy to read. --------- I very much appreciate that the app itself is small and takes little phone storage. (For me, it will not work unless it is on the phone storage.) The maps can be on the SD Card storage, so all the giant files are on the giant storage. No, it does not have navigation, but there are other apps if desired. I'm not interested, so the app fits my \"qualifications\" just fine. ----------- I don't know if there is a paid version to get rid of the ads (couldn't figure that out), but the ads are small & don't get in the way. I would pay to ditch them, however. --------------- The only glitch that I have now is is quite a minor, and amusing, one: Often while I am walking about, the arrow will point opposite to the direction of travel. Example: If the phone is pointing north and I am moving north, the arrow points south, but still moves north. Then, when it gets its wits about itself, the arrow will spin around like mad, eventually settling in the correct position (or the wrong one). It's pretty fun to watch it spin. -------- Some maps that I have don't mark one-way streets, but I think that is the map source's problem, not the app.Besides, if you go the wrong way, you'll figure it out fast! ----------- The only thing I'd like to see added is the ability to make the top of the map be the direction of travel. Right now, North is always up. But, this app is free, so I should not beg someone else to work for free!. ---- I can't get rid of my old review on the Play Store. Please ignore it and consider this review as proper. ---- Thank You Mr/Ms Developer for providing this app for us to enjoy and Thank You for answering my inquiries!",
      "Great app because it's offline. Don't need a mobile or WiFi connection. If you shut down Android or battery dies, you have to go to system and select SD card memory if that's where you stored the maps, as I did. Shows many footpaths as well as roads. I use proper paper maps but this app tells me where I am so it's a useful accessory. The GPS tracker is a useful record, but you can't change the period between each data point.",
      "power consumption is terrible. constant ads. not designed for my android screen",
      "Been working very well and I love the app but i upgraded to the paying version and it has stopped working crashes as soon as I try to download a map....help anyone? ver 1.55",
      "Great Map to have especially where you dont have great cell coverage. Saved our trip when traveling through Cuba where directions and signage are extremely challenging"

      "I have tried this app in three separate devices and its been a dead loss in the most recent two. Its best & most effective performance was in an older Samsung android Galaxy Ace (would be, having an astronomy link) My newest mobile, the display just \"dances\" around, won't stay still to read anything. If you want a decent application for stargazing, then I guess you have to take on one with in-app purchases instead. 2/5 was me being generous, bearing more on its usefulness on a much older phone.",
      "Used to be great, however since I've moved to Australia, when I launch the app, the app continuously shakes. It's really frustrating as you can't see anything and furthermore, it's not calibrated properly and is showing the sun where there is no sun. Very annoying. I used to use this app a lot for star gazing and finding planets. It's a real shame as I'm in a part of the world where star gazing is so good.",
      "Interesting app... Major problem is the compass is never accurate. The app will tell you if the internal compass needs calibration. This never works, even at high accuracy, it still is off by 90 degrees, give or take. There should be an actual manual calibration option. Not some silly flip-your-phone-for-twenty-minutes-for-no-measurable-improvement method.",
      "Absolutely brilliantly Superb. Works as advertised and then some. Spcly the time travel sub feature absolutely rocks. IF u or ur kids are studying or simply fascinated by the dynamic positioning of heavenly bodies then... This app needs to be installed on ur device.. Like yesterday. This Google sky map app is the ONLY APP to get a 5 star rating from me. Of the 500+ I've tried over the past 10 years, not a single app has every got 5 stars nor met my needs and wants, let alone exceed it.",
      "I have used this app many times on many devices, and recommend it when people ask about stargazing apps. Unfortunately, this app does not support auto-rotation on the Moto E4. The Moto E4 does not contain a gyroscope device, instead it relies on data from a 3-axis magnetometer and a 3-axis accelerometer to infer rotation in a given direction. Im not sure if this computed rotation value is accessable in code, but a small code update should fix the issue."

So I would say it is not live imagery just as the other two apps above. Sad because it is advertised as live and in real time and none of them actually are.",
      "I have not tried 360 live yet, however if google map and gallery could stop the false predictions, and the assumptions of places I have been then maybe I would keep my location on. Because it's hard to prove that you was not at the place of an computer generated prediction that landed because of crossing paths with a place. I took a photo inside my home last night and the location placed me about an half a mile away. It is not unusual for my location to drift. Room for improvment.Thank you",
      "Pretty good. The picture feed is old though but still does what it is intended to 3.",
      "Very nice application,,, recommended to improve some locations like Petra Hard to reach inside locations",

      "Great navigation app. Very usable free version. Different maps for cycling and walking. Some maps have all trails. The only app that comes close to paper. Finally bought it after great usage for 180 days to support the developers and get rid of the \"This is a demo\" pop up",
      "I can't sing enough praises of this app. It does everything any outdoor GPS unit ever did, runs in out of coverage areas, and has the most extensive set of worldwide hiking maps I've seen. This last perk is really special: in many countries around the world there simply aren't good maps available for outdoor enthusiasts, but Backcountry Navigator has them all! I never review anything but for this app I am making an exception. I would give it 6 stars, or even 7 if it was possible.",

      "I have been using this for over a year and don't take a long walk without it. This is a great motivational app. It tracks your distance with a verbal mile marker to encourage you to do more. In case you think you went far enough it will give you the distance to verify your actual distance, rate per minute, calories burned. Make sure to turn on your phone location before you start.",
      "I still can't figure out what the recorded message is that plays at the start of the workout because part of it is cut off. \"Let's workout.\"? \"Have a good workout.\"? \"Start workout.\"? \"Just workout.\"(instead of Just Do It)? Otherwise, it launches quickly enough. I seem to recall, however, that years ago I could use the MapMyRide version and simply plot my course in. Maybe that's a mobile vs. computer thing.",
      "Was working great! Really enjoy using it for my walks home from work! 😁 Edit: Recently the app has not been tracking my distance. Even though I walk the same route home and distance, it is now saying I walked .15Km's instead of the 4 Km's that my work is from my house. A bit disappointing.",
      "I'm liking the app so far. But still been waiting for customer service to get back to me then a few days if nobody gets back to me by today or tomorrow going to uninstall find a new app because I have the paid version and if I can't get some customer service help I'm not going to keep giving you my money",
      "Love this app! Easy to use, can make your own routes wherever you are and save them, or it will find routes of varying distance near you. I only wish it were capable of graphing my performance on a route over time. Seems like an obvious thing...maybe I'm just missing how to do it?"

The app has done nothing to help me, ever. I am never able to connect to any wifi spots users have entered information on. I tried 2 years ago, gave up and decided to try again recently. No luck. What's amazing is that the developer takes the time to leave patronizing responses but has never once actually tried to help me.",
      "I stay in a hotel for work during the week and they have free WiFi, 2 of them, but but I could never connect to the one with a full symbol...every week for 3 months..I don't know how this app did it, I tried so many, but I now finally have a full connection... Thank you!!!!",
      "1st time user... Downloaded app, unable to open. Prompt WiFi map has stopped closed app and re attempt multiple times. Still same prompt and unable to open. Was very interested in this platform as we travel quite often. Disappointing, that I can't even open app with out it crashing. 1★ I have sent a system report and feedback to developer via crash report.",
      "This is a complete con and everyone should report this fraud app to the FCC. Why pay 19.99 to find free hotspots? Just buy Data instead and save your money or we can just open the wifi tab on our phone and all will come up. This app is very misleading and steals your password and CC info. Cancel me at once and do not charge my credit card. Here is my notice before 1/21/2020. Cancel this you do not have my permission to use my credit card info or email.",
      "My wifi search on my phone didnt give not even one single sucessful search. Im talking major stores, board of Ed, Hotels and personal wfi. So i expanded search for a 25 mile radius and still nothing. Even went on my balcony. Not one match anywhere. And my GPS on phone has highest output. Sorry but not gonna lie and deleting"

      "First impressions planning a RV trip (FREE): Pros: Most destinations were listed and easily added to my trip. Itinerary relatively easy to edit. Places easy to add. Cons: No satellite, terrain, etc. views on maps. Maps not current for navigation...a major highway near me doesn't show completion...that's inexcusable. Weather forecast was COMPLETELY inaccurate... Unable to download. No easy NAVIGATE option from the itinerary...have to go deeper. This app has potential, but is really basic.",
      "I'm currently enjoying how easier it makes to plan a trip. The only thing I think is missing is a section to calculate expenses and maybe time indicators for each place added in a day. Also integrations with Omio and Airbnb",
      "I was interested in sygic travel Maps offline & trip planner, but after trying out the free ones, I found that many stores names were not on the map, even when searching they were not available, and sadly my place of residence address were not on the maps..malaysia",
      "Great app to plan any trip, by allowing you to lay out the sites you want to see, places you want to go, and seeing on a map how close/ far apart. This lets you plan your day in the most effecient sequence - LOVE it.",
      "Works real well on my older Acer tablet but it choked on this cheapie tablet, not the apps fault though maybe later I will buy a better device and try again."
