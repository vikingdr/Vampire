      "I have it and I use it, and I love it. However the only reason it's not my default messages app, is only because my samsung default app has \"Quick Response\". When I'm driving my taxi, it's nice that I can automatically send a message letting them know im not ignoring them... lol if you guys can get that on your app, I'd be in heaven. Great job tho, guys. It's a great app.",
      "I got this app in order to send/receive texts over wifi. Unfortunately, even after tinkering with it for several hours and reading a lot of troubleshooting articles, I was not able to get this feature to work. Needless to say, I'm disappointed and a bit irritated about the wasted time; I'm now going to uninstall this app and go look for one that actually works.",
      "Well.. This app does sometimes get crappy, changing the interface drastically by showing messages when typing slightly edged towards the left rather its usual form, to the right. Gifs take forever to send when one sends it in a bunch, one after another. It says \"sending..\" on the bottom and most of the time, have to resend it. When searched for gifs, it loads a lot, not even showing up.. just the big, grey block of boxes appear. I would expect something far more smoother. Please fix it.",
      "I just got a new phone and I'm trying to set up the advanced chat features but it keeps getting stuck in the verifying phone number part. It hangs on the 'status: setting up' part when it says verifying number and when I press retry it hangs there for a few minutes before the retry button turns blue again indicating that I can retry again. And I've tried all the things that were suggested in the help section in the articles.",
      "There's a god damn pandemic and text messages are pretty essential. Not just this phone I have now, but every Android. I'm not getting all group texts from my family or some are missing. It's Garbage --- also, Don't patronize me by giving me a default troubleshooting article. There's an issue it's been going on forever and it needs to be fixed. you want people to use your phones instead of iPhones, well I want to be able to receive text messages from my family especially right now... F you"

      "Seriously, what just happened?! App just updated and totally screwed my personalized settings up. Until the update my font was the same as my system font. And the font color was different. Now I can only change the font to a specific font choice and the color blends into the background of the list. I cant tell who's messege I am opening! Why do you guys gotta mess with what wasnt broken. App was great until this update.",
      "The 3/18 update broke the app. It switched my number to my wife's number in the profile, and I am not receiving texts or able to send them. I cannot find a way to fix it within the app. This is ridiculous. Did you people not bother to test this before screwing up the app? It was fine as is, if it isn't broke don't \"fix\" it. Now it's useless. Stupid. I'm working remote thanks to Coronavirus, and now I'm without the texting my team uses to communicate. FIX THIS ASAP.",
      "The update is more of a downgrade. The interface now is smaller making text threads look cluttered. Also can't have black font on most of the colored chat bubbles and white writing is really hard on a lot of peoples eyes, not just mine. Going to try reverting back to old version. It reset all of my customizations even avatar.",
      "Before the updates I really liked this app. I recommended it to all of my friends and family. I don' like it as much anymore. The cursor is nonexistent unless you tap on the screen. You can't just start deleting unless you tap on the screen. I liked the old app, I didn't even mind the old app crapping out on picture mode - which used to be really cute before it sucked. But the changes you keep making don't improve this app. Change it back to having cute pictures without crashing. Have a cursor.",
      "It's extremely ugly now and has a similarly ugly loading screen of sorts all of a sudden when it didn't before. And before they go \"Oh you can change how it looks\", it isn't the backgrounds and bubbles and text styles that are ugly it's the layout and the little bar area you type in that look like the back end of a donkey with the flu standing in the rain. Otherwise it's fine. Four out of five because it technically works well, I just think it looks awful."

This is my first time using this app on the Lg phone , I do not get the same options as I do on my Samsung phone\" Because Lg uses it own message home.

So frustrating, bc I really wish I could keep using this app!",
      "Edit: I have experienced the group messaging issue . It gets me confused because they send separately. Please fix this issue. Old review: A great alternative SMS other than stock SMS messaging app. I've been using this app for about 2 weeks now. It has not once crashed or lagged. It is super user friendly and has a nice, clean, and overall look. I like the personal settings available to use and especially like the fact that there are ZERO ads. This is now my default messaging app. Great job!",
      "love the app. had to upgrade from the note 5 to the note 10plus and the text app that's pre installed doesn't let me (or I just couldn't figure it out) assign different text rings to different people and I couldn't change my back ground. this app allowed me to set up my texting the way I've had it for years! the only down fall I found was all the ring tones that come with the app, to my ears are a little to similar to each other. I just went and downloaded some other tones and problem solved.",
      "I love this app. I only wish the ones I'm sending a message to could also receive my new look when i send them a message. I guess if everyone sent different looks it would clash. It would be fun to see what each person used though. Also i have to choose to use this app each time i check or email someone. Wish it was set to continue until I changed it myself. I chose the black with gold butterflies. Very elegant.",
      "Samsung Note 8. A little disappointed, I have been using this app for a couple of months now and I have noticed that my \"sound indicator\" doesn't always notify me of an incoming message. That can be annoying especially when you are expecting something. I enjoy the backgrounds available for each contact. I hope that the sound can be fixed or I will have to go back too Message +."

Can someone please help with this problem? I've been having this problem for the past 4 days now. Today is the 22nd of March 2020. When I try to send a video from YouTube to my friends the messenger app closes. Or doesn't even show up as an option.",
      "Functionality breaks constantly. Delays in message sending, receiving. People I talk to on a regular basis just disappearing from my recently talked to. Now the latest update has broken sharing from other apps. I have to download every image first and send it through messenger instead of being able to share directly from the other app, as before. Messenger is the only thing keeping me using Facebook and they sell to make it worse every month.",
      "What's wrong whith this app?! Messages can't be sent on my screen, while others see my messages and it doesn't showing me that. My messages are sent but not delivered or seen. And my chat list isn't loading. It happens to me every day and resetting end reinstalling isn't working. Fix this Facebook. It's annoying. 🙄 It started 3-4 weeks ago.",
      "Messenger recent update is bugged and I have tested it already on all 3 devices of mine, both android and iOS. Whenever I am trying to share something through messenger (be it a YouTube video, a photo, or an audio clip I have recorded in my phone's internal app), it will only pull up the Messenger app as if I am not sharing anything!!",
      "messenger sucks anymore.....have not been able to share and send articles to my friends as I did before, by clicking on share, then messenger and then name used to come up and I would click send next to their name, but will not and has not done for three going on four days today and do not know why! Is there something wrong with messenger? Can you please fix this problem and asap, thanks!"

Also takes forever to open a text çonversation and multimedia is a worthless button that just says sending for weeks. Zero stars is the real scare but enjoy money.",

      "I LOVE the app. It the closet thing to iMessage app not just theme wise, but experience wise. I think it should be androids default messaging app... butttttt it's way too buggy, the ads are annoying (I know yall are working on a premium version), and it's very disappointing it uses old Android emojis (which are damn near as bad as windows emojis) instead of using Android 10 emojis. That should be stock and ios emojis would be a GREAT option....p.s. I NEVER leave reviews but I see potential.",
      "very easy to use, very responsive. I like auto dark mode at night. I was hoping that this app would join all messages from the same contact into one thread, but unfortunately not. I guess I have to find my old Nokia for such advanced features :)",
      "I installed this App a few minutes ago. Turned off rich messaging features. I sent a few sms. Still this App consumed 38 MB of data and dropped my phone's battery by 3%. This App looks suspicious, collecting huge amount of data in the background. I think, this App does exactly opposite of what it says here.",
      "Not what was expecting, very good app. The only thing I dislike is the add in message, you can't get rid of it, and there is nothing to buy which will remove the add.",
      "I am really liking this app. Easily the best messaging app I've tried. As others have mentioned, once there is a paid option to be ad free, I can't give it 5 stars. Once that is available, I will change to 5 stars! Keep up the good work."

      "Just started using it so its still under observation. This rate prompt is so annoying, pops everytime i close the app. 🙄 UPDATE: As much as i like this app BUT aside from its annoying ad what i am most concerned is that it won't send a msg with more than 160 char. If i send a long msg after i press send it automatically vanished, wont show on the convo as unsent. And is not received by the recipient. Pls fix so i can rate it with more stars.",
      "This app is great and all... But I only have one problem with it. When you get to the 'Bubble' settings(for the chat), it shows that you can change the color of the bubble around the texts. However, when I get to those settings, there are no colors or options to where I can change them. Please fix this??",
      "I love this new app, but for some reason it uninstalls itself. Further FB doesn't seem to be entirely connect to FB app. Almost like it's this app is independent from FB. I recently got a message notification on my devise notification bar and I try to open to read messenger, it doesn't open this messenger 2020 app instead instruction asks me to download the lite versions of messenger. What up with that. 2 things: 1st-this app needs to be entirely connected to FB & 2nd- self uninstall guard.",
      "Everything works very well unfortunately there are lots of ads that's kind of a bummer. Saying how it's a free app it's just something to deal with unless you want to pay. However sometimes I have problems when I'm typing a message or riding something deleting or erasing that is giving me issues in the past just back out of the app and try again overall I like it",
      "I have only been using this for about a week but overall I'm happy. I like all the themes, and it's smooth typing. They're r times that auto correct puts in words I don't type or swype and u have to hold down the delete button to delete the word which I 4 get to do so its frustrating but overall I'm happy.UPDATE:I DELETED IT I JUST WASNT HAPPY W/IT..ITS NOT BAD JUST NOT 4 ME."

      "Not good.. After the latest update.. You can't reply to messages right away unless you exit the app and go back in.. And it will take a few seconds or more to load it so you can reply to a message.. If you needed to hurry to reply to a message in emergency.. I say your out of luck.. Don't waste time with this app! You'll regret it if you do! I'm not kidding! Months later and still not working! And all these fake 5 star reviews on here by the developers are ridiculous! Update did NOT fix issue!",
      "This used to be a really great app. The last few updates have sucked. I hate the fact that for the past few updates, I have to click on a notification then exit out of the program then restart the program to reply to whoever sent me a message. As of the last update I have lost all notification sound. No matter what I've tried I cannot seem to get the sound back. So now I have to constantly check my phone to see if anyone has messaged me. I hope they fix this app soon as I paid for it",
      "*EDIT* my virus protection is now recognizing GoSMS as malware. I used to love this app but has completely fallen apart. I can no longer send photos and the message popup is so buggy it causes me to force close the app. I've even somewhat looked past the fullscreen pop up ads (that i find to be pretty unsafe in an emergency situation).",
      "I've been using this app for a couple of years, after last update can't send text messages at all, which turned out to be quite a drama as I didn't know they were not being sent and delivered! I'm waiting for an update, but at present cannot use this app and my annual payment has not long been made. Very disappointing considering the number of complaints on this issue in the review comments.",
      "Not happy withrecent updates, now my messages don't make a sound,, and about half of the time when I start responding to a message the send button is still grey so u can't hit send so I have to copy my message, go out of app and come back in to send message. I used to love this app it was second to none but lately it's just a headache I've read the same complaint by other people and hope the developer actually pays attention to these comments and might be able to fix theses issues"

So normal texts from my mom, my daughter's dad, etc are filtered and stupid unsolicited offers for CBD coffee are not. Very buggy, poor functionality as a messaging app, and since I installed this my phone has been acting up constantly.",
      "App is very good very nice, i do appreciate it,but needs more user friendly customizations. Please add more 1) themes 2) different writting fonts and styles 3) different colours for background and different colours for text 4) option to make call from different sim cards 5) a spam folder of blocked messages. Thank you.",

The customer support is the most amazing part of the app. They really care about how their app is running, respond lightening fast to questions and give easy to understand instructions on how to fix issues, which in my case have been problems with my phone not updating correctly. Keep up the good work Textra!",
      "I was really enjoying this app but l started receiving messages all through the night last night, which is highly unusual for me. Upon contacting the senders to see why they were texting me all night, I found out that those messages were sent during the day and evening, but I never received them until after 2am! Why are my messages being delayed?? People probably thought I was ignoring their messages.",
      "Textra is, and probably always will be my favorite alternative SMS app; it's clean, customizavle and almost identicly to stock Messaging apps. The only reason I'm doing four stars across almost every app I use, is the fact that the only new feature with paying for premium is ad removal. I get you have to make your money, but it would be nice to pay even an extra dollar for some more features! Otherwise, this is an amazing app!",
      "This app is top notch. I have a Google pixel 3 and you really can't customize the messaging app the comes stock with the phone. So I figured I'd try this app and this app has many customization features. You can change the way the icon is colored, specific icons for specific contacts, custom word bubble shapes, different fonts, a huge GIF library and many more awesome features. If you want an extremely customizable SMS app, this is the one. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",
      "I love this app so much. The messages send right away, practically EVERYTHING you can customize, and it's just great all together. Hell, you can even change the color of the freaking app icon! This app is exactly what I was looking for. I have one issue though, whenever I send a video or gif or song or whatever, it takes a few minutes to send it, I don't know if my phone is just a little crappy or if it's a issue with the app itself, but still, Textra is great with that issue or not! :D"

      "Since installing Pulse 2 weeks ago I have sent more SMSs than I did in the 12 months before. The native apps (I'm using the Linux and OSX apps) make it so easy to manage messages. I've cleaned out all my old SMSs for the first time in years and it only took me 20 minutes. The apps have numerous issues - I had to manually refresh my account when I first set it up, I can't see a way to create folders using the native app, I had an SMS fail to send from my phone but the desktop app shows it as sent. BUT the ability to manage my SMSes from my desktop and smash out a 160-character text in 15 seconds is just too good. I would give this app 7 stars if I could, regardless of all the little issues.",
      "This app is very inconsistent, It will send and receive messages and a few minutes later it won't send and it won't receive messages. I unenstalled it and reinstalled it and it worked great for an hour and then -- AGAIN -- it stopped sending and receiving messages. Sadly this program has several virtues but if it isn't trustworthy, it's useless 😟😟",
      "Love everything about Pulse, except the issue you sometimes face of sending / receiving video and the quality of the video. I've read numerous chats as to why that is and possible fixes, but still the issue exists. I'm a Verizon customer with the new Google Pixel 4, so if anyone has any insight or resolution on this please enlighten me. Still a (5) star app in my opinion, but really wish there was a way to remedy the video thing",
      "Excellent app! The ability to filter on phrases is a key feature that makes this app worth the purchase! However, there is a bug in the app. If you delete or archive multiple conversations at once, only the first one you do takes effect. If you exit the app and go back in, then all of the other archive/delete operations are forgotten and those messages return to the inbox.",
      "I've used this app for a very long time and have always loved it. However, for a few months now, some of my messages come in VERY delayed or not at all. Many times, pictures that are sent to me won't download or show up. I uninstalled Pulse for a week and used a different app and didn't experience any of those issues. But I love Pulse so much, that I re-installed it after a week, only to immediately experience the exact same things. It's still one of the better SMS apps available though"

It combines all the best features in messaging apps with optional AI and more into a single app. It’s completely free, with no ads, no catch. When texting other Mei users, messages are sent as RCS (the upgrade to SMS), and end-to-end encrypted, so you can chat for free internationally and know it's secure!  See why Mei is one of the highest-rated SMS/MMS/RCS texting apps in the Play Store!\r\n\r\nOn top of it all, our app comes with an optional advanced AI named Mei (pronounced ‘May’) that can give you real-time information as you text. Imagine Mei as your assistant, expert adviser and best friend, who's always available to tell you something about your conversations.\r\n\r\nDoes your best friend sound a little different today?  Does this person you just met seem romantically interested?  How do I best chat with my boss so we work better together?\r\n\r\nThere are hints, feelings, personalities and meaning buried in our text histories that are already on our phones (you don't even have to text through our app first).  Our AI assistant can interpret all your text conversations (even ones imported from other apps) and tell you things she notices about your chats that will make you better informed, ultimately leading to better relationships.  \r\n\r\nHow? She's seen millions of conversations just like yours where other users taught Mei how to recognize patterns that are indicative of almost everything in a relationship.  Our AI algorithms were first trained in English, but as more users around the world have interacted with Mei, the models have/will become more accurate in those languages.  So please correct Mei when she’s wrong and check back later as she’ll improve over time!\r\n\r\nMei is compatible with MightyText, Pushbullet and mySMS for desktop and web access (our own desktop version coming soon).

      "I came back hoping that there were some changes and I am disappointed. Other than changing colors and adding a background nothing has changed. The scene doesn't light up when you receive a message, so if you phone is on silent you may not know for a long while that you have a message. A big let down for me.",
      "It works well most of the time! I like being able to stylize my texts. The only thing I currently have an issue with is when I try to send texts and it says I need to chose a recipient or whatever it says then I have to exit my texts, go back into them, then it sends.",
      "I loved this app, until it stopped functioning. My primary issues are similar to everyone else's, I'm frequently not notified about a message or it doesn't come through till I open the app, I get the message that I need to input the person's number while in our chat despite having the number saved. However now my AI is completely dead. I can request alerts all I want but the symbol just spins, never giving me any messages at all. Im fully updated so, its basically just turned into a texting app.",
      "Original: I don't use the AI features, but everything else works perfect. I've been through a couple texting/messaging apps, and I was tired of them never working properly...even on basic functions. MEi sends message quickly, and I really like the delayed message sending feature. It's especially handy when you think of something late at night, and you don't want to wake anyone up. You just want to get the message drafted while it's on your mind. Update: The app has started to crash and freeze..",
      "Overall this app is fine but.. 1. Needs storage permission compulsorily to use basic SMS functionality. Why? Nobody does that! 2. As SIM selection is combined with message scheduling functionality, it's not very intuitive. Beyond that, selected SIM is not displayed prominently (in the text box) while sending and (on message thread) after sending the SMS."

      "It's a great app that lets you talk to friends on PSN and is much easier than going and turning on your PlayStation just to chat. Though I would ask that you guys please add a couple features like PSN chat rooms and video/voice chat other than just messages. Also with messages where it shows the time sent and received, it's very buggy, I'll send a message and it'll say a random completely different time. For example I'll send a message at 10:00 pm and it'll say 9:43 am or something like that.",
      "The app itself is overall useful. But there are glaringly upsetting points about the messenger app for playstation. Why does it need 3.3GB of space when Discord and other messengers are only 150MB? That is way more than necessary. There is nothing in this app that is different to make it better over others, you can't even have a party chat through it with your message group. Yet Facebook Messenger and Discord (with the exception of needing approvals) can have voice proper voice chats.",
      "It's a great app. Use it all the time when I don't feel like turning my PS4 on. I would suggest it if you have a newer phone. I have a LG Stylo 5, and it works perfectly. I had a LG Stylo 4+,( Just like a year difference between manufacturing ) and I would open the app, and it would cause my phone to shut down, turn on, freeze, and restart. So, if you plan on getting this app, get a newer phone. But in all, a very great app.",
      "2 stars because the app does work but for a while now my messages would disappear and not how on here or console anymore. when I would delete the app my messages still don't appear. Edit: after getting in contact with the playstation support staff everything does seem to be working properly now.",
      "The only thing you can do in this app is send messages. I really don't understand why the chat feature wasn't implemented in the PlayStation app. This way you need to install both the messages app and the PlayStation app because you can't do basic stuff like sending or accepting friend requests or viewing other peoples profiles in this app since the app forces you to install the PlayStation app to do those things."

      "I am sad to say that this app has some nice qualities, but I am very disappointed right now. I wanted to like this app, but I was robbed of a win on their lucky spin wheel! The wheel landed on a $50 Amazon gift card and then, as if to say \"Oops just kidding\" it makes a rapid jump to the next prize of 15 coins! What the hell!! Even the \"shout outs\" mentioned my name and the $50 I was suppose to have won, but was just swiped away from right under me!! Also they practically force a 5 star rating!!",
      "Doesn't seem to support sharing MMS or locations, separates combined contacts so be prepared for lots of duplicates. I Don't want an app that doesn't support the best features that come with our stock messaging apps but it adds several unnecessary features like optimizer and booster, which most phones already come with. The app keeps closing as I'm typing this. 3rd time having to reopen. Definitely not recommended. Uninstalling!",
      "I miss the old version this new app is sinking i cant see what i am typing unless i use quick or pop reply",
      "ASAP kept stopping over and over a couldn't even type messages without its stating that there is no problem with this app I really like this at first what is the problem with this app why did it do that",
      "So it felt a little misleading. I was hoping that this app would have all of my accounts in one place. Allowing me to remove all other apps. This app just provides you with notifications. It's like a watcher app. I don't need that I wanted one app that allowed me to login to everything and handle direct messaging with it."

But a full screen video ad every time I click on a message is just egregious.",

And I don't have to give my phone number and get a text code or register to use it. Nice",

      "Not bad, but does not capitalize the first letter during typing n also cant send messages direct from contact, it will ask you to add number again",
      "In the Private Box Setting under Notification, you can adjust the notification, whether you want it to have a sound, vibrate it or keep it silent. When I tried to turn off the sound in the General Notification Panel, you can still hear a sound. Every number has its individual setting. Can you automatically turn off the sound for all the numbers if in the General Notification Setting is set to silent mode? There are lot of things to do if you have lots of numbers stored in the Private Box. Thanks",
      "Not worth the money. This app has too many flaws for me to want to spend money on it. Sometimes I would not receive a new message alert. One time I did get an alert but there was nothing there, until I checked again 10 min later. There has been times that I've tried to send a text and the app says it's an invalid number despite the number being in my phone book. If they could resolve these issues it would be a nice app."

      "This is a good app, and it definitely has potential! However, I am disappointed with the following; (too many ads) that there is no remove ads with purchase option, when you lock an SMS convo with a passcode by tapping on the unlocked padlock icon - it prompts you to set a password. You have to enter this password everytime to see the conversation. My issue is that there is no \"permanent\" unlock the convo feature after it's been locked. I'll rate 5 stars when the developer fixes these issues.",
      "Its perfect for keeping in contact with my son while hes gone and thats so awesome 5 stars for me. I wish you could add the feature screen share while on facetime so that the both people can watch a movie together while on facetime. That would be so great if they could add that cus I had it for my LG G5 but my Samsung A70 doesnt have this feature and its newer phone so Im confused. Anyways my point is that its amazing and great in everyway. Its awesome for when they are away from Home",
      "Response to message doesnt work. Message sent but still says sending. Contact name doesn't show for some contacts but when pressing the number, the info shows that it actually is a saved contact. No delayed sending option. No pin to top option. Really no options other than customization. Uninstalling. Going back to the stock messaging app.",
      "A super clean, beautiful interface w/ optional themes available at your disposal. Nothing to cluttered or clunky either, as it's all very well optimized. No lag. No annoying plug-ins/extensions or integrated ads planted within the interface. Ultimately a great app with no nonsense from the dev's. Definitely a step up from the native stock app on my S9+. Gripes: Photos are organized by album rather than date. Ads Redundant emoji button. We already have one. Contacts don't update quickly.",
      "I love this app. It does everything that I need it to do. But I have to comment on these stupid huge emojis that keep popping up. They are pissing me off because they keep popping up when Im trying to text and I keep hitting them. Please get rid of them. Other thank that its great I can talk to my kids that are to young for an actual phone.😁 Its the only app I use for video chatting. And sometimes I completely forget that I cant call people on my phone and just use the app instead."

      "This app would be perfect if it didn't jump to the unlock screen everytime I get a text message. No matter what I'm doing on my phone it immediately interrupts it and jumps to the unlock screen for every message. There is nothing in the settings to stop it. That is a silly feature. I always get text messages which means I'm always getting interrupted with that blue unlock screen, super annoying. Unfortunately I dont see myself keeping this app much longer.",
      "Good most of the time. Sometimes doesn't work and you can access everything that should have been \"Safe\"",
      "App selects MAX SIX msg apps on your phone. You can NOT change the six it chooses ... Period. No type of settings. The Flip side: for the six apps it does choose to lock. You will have to enter the password LITterally every time. Even after you have unlocked the phone and the desired app.",
      "been using this app for years already. But after I updated my phone I can't unlock my messages using fingerprints, only pattern. it always says \"register fingerprint before enable\" even though I already registered my fingerprints.",
      "This app uses a pattern to lock certain apps. Only used if for the text messages. Biggest issue is it pops up anytime you get a message so if you are in the middle of something you it interrupts. It's very very annoying!"

So you should try to but when you want to text or call someone you have to go to the app to do it in a cool way",

      "I love messenger kids because it has things to do while you are talking with your friends. An example of this is when I was bored talking to my friend, so I started a game! Another Thing I love about this app is that you can type in your friends names to request to talk with them. So easy! Download now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
      "Great idea needs work. While in the app it lists some of my kids contacts but not all of them. It also does not open chat heads or give any kind of notification when someone sends a message while you aren't on you don't know I have multiple kids so as a parent it's frustrating trying to manage their accounts. If I manage one it signs me into theirs as them and then won't let me sign out to check on another ones account. I had to uninstall and reinstall. It has lots of potential but needs work.",
      "I love how this app is helping my kids stay connected with their friends during the shelter in place. I don't like that the tablet constantly rings when my young son is trying to take a turn playing on the tablet & there is no way to turn it off temporarily or put it on silent. When it has been ringing & you open the tablet the app automatically opens, I don't like that. You can set a sleep mode but \"weekends\" are Friday and Saturday & \"weekdays\" are Sun-Thurs, I need M-F after school hrs.",
      "I like the app and all, but I wish video chat was full screen like regular video chats are. Also, instead of you having to take a picture as your profile, I wish you could just like put any photo in your gallery instead of having to take a picture of yourself or something. If you guys just edit these things, it would probably be the best messaging app for kids, and for me.",
      "SO AMAZING! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHAT WITH PEOPLE JUST BY ENTERING A CODE! Just enter a code and boom! You can now chat with another person! It's that easy! There is some ads but they never occur when you are chatting or typing! You can even see when someone sent a message just by CLICKING THE MESSAGE!!!!I rated this five stars for a reason! DOWNLOAD NOW!!!"

I have played with all the settings and turned off some of the settings in the stock messenger and it has not helped.

      "I have used Viber for text and voice calls for many years now. I have been mostly satisfied with the overall performance of the app, however, the app has been very leggy lately. Messages sent and recieved mostly do not appear at all or appear a few hours later or some times even next day. Photos sent keep uploading and then 'failed to send' notification appears and photos recieved do not download. I have checked if I have 4g or wifi issues, but I don't. I t is the app issue. Please fix.",
      "Glad to see that emojis have been updated. However, the \"Last seen\" status is a feature that is still completely messed up: it always shows that someone is online or was active a few minutes ago, even though he has been inactive for a while (even if he hasn't touched his phone for hours). And while I write a message to someone, Viber does not update his status and shows that he is online even if he is not any more. Still needs improvements.",
      "Have used Viber for years now, however in the last 24 hours it's become unusable. It freezes my entire Pixel 4 while replying to a message, or it will freeze while typing a reply. It also force shuts itself with a \"Viber is not responding\" pop up. Really frustrating as the majority of my family and friends use this app and not being able to reply to any of my messages is very annoying.",
      "Ok they reverted back. Thank you. Old review : last version took away \"attach my location\" to a message option. Was the only reason I used this app. Other similar apps are better at other things. Viber removed a feature and does not even mention it in the update. Viber is taking any options/features that made it better then others out. Businesses work on features that differentiate their product, Viber works on make their product same or worse then others by taking features away. genius!",
      "BRING BACK DOODLE FEATURE, PLEASE! No matter I set picture quality on excellent, it's still poor quality when I receive it. Just add original quality, not low, medium, excellent or whatever. For video it's even worse. When I receive video, the same has much worse quality than original file that was sent to me. ADD ORIGINAL QUALITY for sending / receiving photos and videos, WHERE DO YOU LIVE? And ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MESSAGES, really? Annoying and not good at all. 😠 Bring back Doodle!!!"

      "Themes and effects are great. But i don't see group sending of messages. Since im using huawei y9 phone, camera automatically popped up upon opening of private messages.",
      "15/03/20 - I'm giving this App ( ONE ⭐ STAR) at the moment purely on the fact I've just installed the app and I want to see how it works out. I've read some reviews that's why I thought I'd give it a whirl. What I've tested so far is good and I like the setup of it all, but I would like to redesign the sms part like what you can do on the NEXT SMS app so you make your own designs as I'm not a big fan on bubble texts I like it to be just the text only but I'll try it and if it grows on me.",
      "My texts are going through twice on group chats. Photos are not being sent/received. I like the customizable options. I thought whoever received the text could not screen shot but it's only on my phone which is dumb, why would I turn on an option to limit myself. Also I'm not receiving notifications for all texts.",
      "Update: looking for something else because 1) writing button should float on bottom, it's too far for thumb access, 2) needs option to have notifications be strictly on bar and then offer the ablility to pull down for additional details as opposed to notifications being shown as an overlaying reply box 3) needs a landscape mode for conversation list, 4) cannot create a group chats, 5) cannot search conversations, 6) cannot hide phone numbers, 7) no support",
      "Remember that SMS texts means SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE. If you write long texts and send media, you may want to consider installing an MMS text messaging application. MMS allows more information to be delivered to the recipient without jumbled words or letters."

      "No respect for my privacy. Requires storage permission to do anything. Absolutely unacceptable. Uninstall. Reply : That's no excuse to require storage permissions before anything works. Also the password field uses a normal text box not a password box, and it has an undisclosed character limit that is quite small, and then the password is displayed on the screen. Overall I'm getting a pretty bad impression about security and privacy.",
      "The most interesting feature about the app is that you need a password to access the app, it is safe. And when someone else tried to spy on your phone, you can simply shake to lock, very convenient private messenger app",
      "it's nice to see someone making an effort to provide an encrypted messaging app. This private messenger app works well. There's always room for personalizing/improving messaging apps, but this one works just fine for me as I don't require anything fancy",
      "Messaging, voice and video calling, disappearing message and much more, It is safe to call and text free in this private messenger app. best of all, decent privacy without 3rd parties constantly monitoring your communication.",
      "As for privacy, only time is going to tell. I have been using this private messenger app for quite a long time since it launched at the first time, and I have recommended many people to use this app to get a burner phone number, call and text free with it"

      "Get a notification at the top of my main screen showing a text, but when I open the app to see it, nothing is there. Sent an email to that address at 5:45 this morning, central US DST. I am able to receive messages this morning, but when I send them, I get a red '!' on the screen and a popup notice about something with APN settings, but it disappears before I can see much else.",
      "Chomp rates right up there with my once-favorite texting app, which also used to promise \"ad-free, for free, forever\" once I bought it and ended up becoming a $59.95 annual subscription, so I'm skeptical. That said, the customization on a per-user basis is particularly useful and the primary reason I'd used the other product: I like knowing if it's a text message I can ignore or need to read. I'm not a fan of the inability to attach v-cards (VCF contact files), which is an on-going requirement for me as a Realtor and many others in the service space. Every salesperson wants to be able to give everybody they meet a card, and today that means getting my info into their phone! To accomplish that, I've got to select another messaging app and change it to default, then find and select send my card, and then switch back. WHAT A PAIN!! Even the native Samsung G10 app sends VCF!",
      "I love chomp, been using it for years. Highly recommended it. But there is exactly one annoyance I wish could be fixed: when in a large group chat, if when someone \"Likes\" a message (presumably with Facebook messenger), it sends the entire message again 8 or 10 times. Usually large messages. I would think there should be a programmatical way to handle this that doesn't clutter the feed.",
      "Purchased this app awhile ago and really like many of its features. Until today when I got caught up in a 13-way conversation with some people I didn't know. Turns out, you can't mute a conversation. That's an app killer for me. Had to switch to an onboard app which I really don't like. :-(",
      "It's a great message app, hands down. The only thing I can't figure out is when I set my carrier limit to \"carrier has no limit\", it still won't send larger files. I think you guys should make it possible to send any file through your app, that would be the icing on this beautiful 🍰😉"

      "Rediculous amount of adverts!! This used to be a really good way of keeping in touch when you are using your tablet instead of grabbing the phone every time it pings. Now an annoying advert comes up everytime you open or click on the program. All meant to force you to pay the $5-6 per year to stop you screaming at the money grabbing people that make this program. Going to unload it as soon as I find an alternative.",
      "Useful tool but the app gets stuck sometimes and doesn't respond or crashes altogether. Otherwise it's a convenient app if youre using your phone as a hotspot for a tablet like I do in a place with no wifi and poor phone signal, it saves the agro of going to the phone all the time.",
      "Very nice and really convenient. Only one big complaint though. Way too many ads and way too frequently. Other than that, awesome!!",
      "This app does not allow you to text by itself; it requires another actual texting app already loaded on your tablet. If I had that I would not need this app.",
      "quite easy to use and easy to set up. There are ads on Start up, however this usually dissapears after just one Click! overall a very easy to use app with an easy interface and very user friendly!"

      "I want to love this app, but it just keeps breaking down. I thought moving to a new S10 would solve it...and for a while it was fine. Now I have notifications from phone calls that won't clear, and it otherwise continues to cause more pain than pleasure. From the other reviews here, does not appear you fare any better with the paid version. It's a shame as conceptually it's the best app out there but execution is everything.",
      "Originally I gave this app 5/5 stars but now it's 1/5. I paid for the premium version of the app but have recently been getting advertisement texts through the app. I've also noticed for a long time that my texts aren't being received or sent on time, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. This has been getting progressively more common and I simply can't use this anymore. Both of these issues are extremely common complaints as in most of the reviews. It's unacceptable and I regret paying for this app.",
      "In the hope of the app developer reading this, this is more of an error report than a review. I can't seem to contact you either through FB, Twitter or the app's \"Assistance\" so I'm trying here. Today I got a notification from the mood app saying \"This call - Private number\". I have no clue what it means and I can't remove it from my notification area, without disabling all notifications from the app. While trying to report it in the app I received another with a smiley. Why am I getting this?",
      "I used to love this app. Have been using it since 2018. But Mood has recently gone downhill because of all the advertising. I was okay with the new ad banner at the top of the app, but I just found out they've been advertising their app at the end of all my recent text messages without telling me! I've been sending text messages to customers, and they've been getting these ads in my messages! Very embarrassing! App has been deleted and don't recommend it to anyone!",
      "Updated my review. The previous issue of my texts not sending on delay has been resolved. Thank you I always loved this app. Had everything I wanted in a messaging app UNTIL the latest update. I agree with all the other recent reviews. I can't send texts unless I have a 0 second delay set. I'm going to find another messaging app to use, until you fix this issue. I will change my rating if this issue gets resolved"

      "This app is literally near perfect in every way, my only issues are the following: 1) Sometimes chat heads won't close even after I read a message (unless I force close the app) 2) I despise auto emojis: I need to know of I can turn off :< being a 😠 - or ｡:ﾟ(;´∩`;)ﾟ:｡ turning into ｡:ﾟ(;´∩`😉ﾟ:｡ PLEASE, I legit will jump to premium if these are fixed, I can barely compare other texting apps to this one, after years of switching, this app is the one.",
      "This is the ultimate messaging app! Whatever you want to want to customize, you can! It is great and the one time purchase for premium is worth it! Love it! Hope you guys continue creating awesome apps!",
      "I love how customizable it is. Perfect for people who want thier apps to accomodate them, rather than having to do everything the way some app developer decides. Does require some outside the app research for some fancier options like date formatting.",
      "It's an ok app but it doesn't really give the delivery reports and when you click on options for each text for example not delivered well it doesn't really show anything different to be able to know which text sent but not delivered is confusing"

      "The e2e encryption by default is great. The app can become your default SMS/MMS app: great! The voice quality on both voice-only and video calls is very clear, though a little, I don't know, tinny? There are no issues whatsoever understanding each other, it just doesn't sound natural. It seems that there's a little bit of degredation of image quality when sending pictures and videos and when on video calls. It'd be nice to have markdown support. Overall, I've got my family is on this, so...",
      "It's been a very great app for me for several years, five stars to me, but after a certain recent update, it just freezes at random now, and sometimes I have to do a battery pull because it'll freeze my entire device during use as well. When Signal messes up but does not freeze my entire device, I check running apps and it's hogging a half a gig of RAM and hogging all 4 cores of my device's CPU, and I have to force-close it. And there have been other times it didn't receive messages (SMS and Signal) because I didn't realize the app was messing up at the time. Or I'll find my device is suddenly dead, and when I power it up and check what apps have recently used how much battery, it shows Signal was what drained it. It's like the app is getting caught in some sort of stupid infinite loop, and I wished I could explain what causes it to help you pinpoint it, but there's no rhyme or reason when it does act up. I mean, I work in I.T., I get it that things act up, and I learn to live with it, but on the other hand, I also NEED this to \"just work.\" If this issue keeps up after the next couple of updates then I'll have to turn to something else.",
      "Great App! I have been using Signal for about a couple of years now. I have had a few problems with it some messages not going through until later. But they have since have fixed that bug. Now, it's great. Flawless. I feel safe when using this app. I feel that my messages are going through with no problem. I feel that I can feel safe with nobody trying to hack my messages! So, give Signal a chance. You will be glad that you did!:)👍",
      "Great communicator, true end to end encryption. Call quality better then WhatsApp. It has some minor issues, but nothing what I would be worried about. I believe it will be fixed in future updates. The best I used so far. Group chat is not encrypted as far as I know, but neither other communicators offer that. I would be happy if there is no need to refresh signal's contact list when you add new contact to system's contact list. Didn't notice any other problems.",
      "It looks OK and sends messages OK. A big BUT though.. Notifications randomly stop. This happened before so I stopped using it. It works fine for a few days after I install it, but then it's stops notifying of a new message. I have no clue someone has messaged me until, by sheer luck, I happen to open the app and up pops a notification! By my reckoning, this makes the app pretty useless."

      "Been using Mighty Text for about three months now and am very happy with every aspect of it. Does exactly what you need it to do without the other party having it installed on their devices. Being able to make, reply or just monitor incoming phone texts while on the computer keyboard is much more convenient and faster for these old fingers than trying to do a long text on the phone keypad. Will be upgrading to Mighty Text Pro in the near future. Very well behaved program that does NOT interfere with the normal operation of other computer programs in anyway. Bob",
      "There is no obvious way to stop the annoying reminder that covers the bottom right of the screen to say I have not checked in. I know that; tell me once, but then stop the constant reminders! No matter how many times I close the reminder, it comes back. There are programs that need that real estate, and the reminder is a problem. It also does not go away when you check into the program.",
      "I have been using this app with windows and linux OS's for a number of years. I just upgraded my phone to a Galaxy S10 and it works well, actually better than with the S6. I like that it also works with my tablet. I recommend it for people who do not like tapping on screens, the amount of data for the free version is a bit limited, otherwise it's great.",
      "I have been using the Mac version for several years and I am very pleased with it. For the last year or so I have also been using iPad (beta) version which I find even more useful — as I always have my iPad with me. The great thing about this app (for me) is that I can read and send SMS from the app — this even works when I leave my phone at home (so long as the phone is connected to the internet). My phone battery is old (like me) so having the ability to receive and send SMS when I am out of the house — when the phone is at home charging is a boon for me.",
      "I use this all the time. Allows me to text from my personal PC, work PC, note pad, and phone. And sync with them all. Also I can save my phone PICS to my PC or note pad directly without having to plug in a USB cord to my phone. Works Great."

    "comments":[
      "Going way off road these days, not just downhill. With every update, they remove another feature (custom notification sounds), then another (location), and another... Some features, like saving videos (a JFIF preview is what is saved, like the Web version), are broken and never fixed, while others (like sharing an audio clip) are half-removed because they want to force people to use another product (Drive) instead. Maybe just do that last bit, and use something (*anything*) else at this point.",
      "They are slowly killing this app. It used to work well, but functionality has been dying and I'm guessing it's a bit on purpose given that they have been trying to make other kinds of messaging apps. First, custom ringtones went away, now, there is no notification ringtone at all, just vibrate. It's sad as the functionality with desktop Gmail and the Google voice numbers just used to be great. There's less and less reason to use this.",
      "The app works fine and is a great way for me to contact and call my friends. The only problem is that I don't know how to change the ringtone. At first the notifications only came in as vibrations. Then I changed the notification sound back to normal, but the ringtone would be the notification sound looped. Could someone help me figure out how to change the ringtone back to normal? Thank you.",
      "Just not the same. It wouldn't make the noise anymore when I got a text. I'd be missing texts, and texts not sending. Did an update on my phone which updated the app, and now the names of my contacts aren't associated with their phone numbers. I have group texts and i don't even know who's sending what text because it shows the number instead of the contact. Wish I didn't update it now. Would like to know who's sending me texts, not the number.",
      "I love this app for it's multi functionality, great all in one messaging app. It is too bad Google is not investing enough in Hangouts. Instead they went for some weird multiple single task apps like that Allo bs app none one is using anyways. Duo is not bad for video calls, but again the problem is that every one you want to contact and chat with must have all these messaging apps installed on there phones. And why the hell did they remove location sharing?"

      "This is a really good messaging app. I definatelly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is, because there's a very small selection of themes. It would be perfect if the developer would make more themes or make it an option for the user to create their own themes (like DIY). Other than that, the app is easy to use and works well.",
      "Actually pretty good for functionality and setting up themes, colors, bubbles, etc. Only downside is theres no option to remove ads. 4 stars.",
      "Love this application, it seems very easy to use and lovely themes! The fonts are exceptional & I'm looking forward to using this application for a long time! Is there a ad free version?",
      "Hey, 3 stars only, way too many ads every time u open the app and i cant find a way how to buy or to purchase to complete remove of the irritating ads. One thing there is no Private Box.",

      "Bug with notifications. I have been using the app for more than a year now. Really love the way it works and organise everything. But when you make this app as you default app for messages it doesn't show any notification specially OTPs. Been struggling with it for past few days. Changed and modified notification settings for both app as well as system but couldn't find any solution. Set stock android messaging app as default again,problem solved!!!",
      "Used to be the best app but recent update has given birth to some bugs like I used to reply to the message from the app's notifications earlier but now after replying a message notification switches to \"Sent\" notification and to send next message I have to open an app. And When I do it, it didn't open until I dismiss the \"Sent\" notification. Using Nokia 6.1 Plus Android 10",
      "Please make search optimisation in a easy manner when we send texts. For example: if I want to search for contact naga sudhan uncle. After typing naga uncle i can't search for the contact because I didn't type sudhan in between. We have facility in samsung default application and apart from this this application is fantastic and keep it up guyzzzz",
      "The app is too good to be true. I can't describe how useful it is. Sorting into promotions, transactions, personal messages saves the day. However, I do have a minor battery concern. You seem to run a service called ForegroundAppTrackerService which seems to keep the phone awake for a while. It takes a few percentage flat off my battery. Android message app doesn't do this. Can you look please into this? Thanks a ton for this great app! Update: Reducing rating due to no fix and no response",
      "I would be a fan of this app if the stability and reliability issues are attended to. It's a great app with organising features but lacks the reliability. I liked the themes, tabs, organization overall. But after using it for couple of months, got frustrated that I am not getting messages and even important messages from banks. I am afraid to use it again. Thank you for the instructions. It works fine now."

      "Excellent. Been using this app for years now. Had a problem with Avast flagging it as a virus. Contacted customer service. They were very helpful. They contacted me back straight away. They have spoken to Avast. And the problem was sorted out in no time. No problems at all now. Excellent customer service. Would definitely recommend this app.",
      "I have been using it for 6 months becuase I hated the native app in my Samsung Galaxy S8 plus and I needed something more powerful with more options. I tried a dozen other apps and this one is perfect for everything I needed, too many things to mention, give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Great SMS texting app [HHw1hZv6]",
      "Love this app! I've used it for years. I love the how easy it is to customize. However I just spent the last hour trying to figure out why my notification sound wasn't making a sound. I was trying everything until I clicked on something & it took me to the google play store, I saw an update was available. I read the items that were updated & saw the 1st one was fixing the no notification problem. I did the update & bingo all is working now. My favorite feature is the delay in sending a text!",
      "Great feature-set and absolutely top notch support! After upgrading to Android 10, I had all kinds of issues with every text messaging app I was trying out. Handcent was quick to respond and to resolve the problem. Between personalized notifications, customizable themes and the private box, this has everything I need, plus the peace of mind of reliable support.",
      "I've been using this app for many years across many phones. I thought maybe it would be my new phone's battery (Galaxy S10). However it turns out this app is eating up almost 8% of my battery just being idle, according to my battery usage graph. That's just Insane. My phone battery is about just as bad as my previous phone after 4 years of use. I truly enjoy using this app but this battery usage issue Seriously Needs to be resolved. Please fix this. I would very much like to rate this 5 stars."

      "I have been using the Paid version for a couple of years using an Samsung phone. Overall it works very well and is an important app for my desktop. I have it running in the Chrome browser and use it for texting all day. Sometimes it is slow to capture new contacts, so I refresh periodically during the week. Occasionally, some phones (mostly older iphones) have problems receiving the text. My wish list is the ability to change fonts & sizes, and control paragraph formatting with better WYSIWYG.",
      "So far when I install on Samsung S10+, app seems to think phone is a tablet and says \"Make sure this is the same account you used to set up your phone\". I am not given any instructions for setting up phone. I think I don't have the correct app but can find no app that says it is for my phone. Tablet is a Galaxy Tab A (10.5) and has exactly the same message! App is so far of no use to me.",
      "Can't finish app setup!🥺 Hello, I'm experiencing the exact same problem as Karen Boyster on this review page. I also have a galaxy S10+ phone and galaxy tab a but 9.7. I tried to send an email to the address you told her to contact but that email for support is coming up as invalid and won't send. I'm really dissapointed and need tech support",
      "I've been enjoying Mighty Text for over a year now. Took a little work to get everything paired but it's great to have an app that pairs on three devices. Best part is the ability to compose and send texts on my laptop- and it let's me know when a call is coming in also. A real convenience that I use every day.",
      "Seems to work well but no way to create or add to a contact or even copy the contact number from the app? That should be a basic feature. I can use Universal Copy to copy the number from the screen then go and create the contact but this is a silly workaround!"

      "It's not fun to have to pick your number after it expires and get a completely new one I have went to the help center and it told me that there was a \"new number button\" but there wasn't one there so basically I had to keep on reinstalling this app and then uninstall it I gave it two because it does work it's just really annoying",
      "This app has been such a blessing for me. It allows me to stay in touch with my family and friends by texting and calling free using WiFi and this incredible free app. Due to job loss from company shutdown no longer able to afford cell phone plans for family causing great hardships but the devs of this app, guardian angel and lifeless useless phones with no service plans on hand and cheap wifi for low-income families my family and I can start to get back on feet again plus shed stress also.",
      "The calls always drop and the app constantly crashes. In order to reach someone I have to try and call back now up to 3 times in a row! I can't even send emojis to people because they appear as a scramble of random script to them. Not being able to just pick up when someone calls is SO inconvenient. Also it sounds like the conversations are being tapped. You can hear rattling or your own voice echo back through your speaker. The loud ads at the end of calls are annoying. Zero stars if I could.",
      "Zero stars.I used this app for for everyday calling and texting for almost 2 years until the other day when it automatically logged me out and then said my phone# has expired. I lost all of my text history and all of the #s I had conversations with that weren't saved in my contacts because I never thought I would randomly just lose access to my own conversations over night. I have customers that owe me money that have no way of collecting from now and they can't contact me now either. Not happy",
      "Brilliant app! Quick to sign up and set up everything how I want it etc! Far cheaper than buying credit, I've had a reliable service so far on calls and texts. Would recommend this app to everyone that loves keeping in touch with people and who want to do it for as cheaply as possible, or even for free if you don't mind watching a few videos and adverts."

I can text and call them fine but the app needs the +1 to work so I have to manually enter in the ph# each time. Also, the app lied to me saying my sms was sent when nothing was delivered due to the +1 problem.",
      "It is a good app. However, there is a crucial feature missing. That is a date setting not only hours) for a task end. For instance: If I am on vacation it should allow me to set the task for a date of my return. If you make the feature I'll be happy to give 5 stars.",
      "who give you the idea of always connected ??? it was your ??? horrible experience because I have to be always connected and drain my battery because......? why ? nothing is working without internet. even I bought the app, I have a lot of ads till I connect again. BTW, wifi ON and wifi OFF IS NOT WORKING ( android 10, sony Xperia). all settings are available only if I am connected. VERY ANNOYING most probably I'll drop the app and uninstall it... I don't need my money back, be yours.",
      "Good app. I bought the paid version. I need to send a few SMS each day at the same time. I tried it today but it only sent it when I opened the app. More than 20 minutes too late. Did I miss something? Overall I like the abundance of features, including twin sim capabilities. Good work guys!",

      "Its cute and all But ot doesn't send messages It always leaves an exclamation mark after sending,making it look like the text wasn't sent Fix that",
      "nice App l like it bt no sound for incoming txt!!",
      "App seems good. The problem is that you have to set it as your default SMS app. If you didn't have to do that than I'd use the app",
      "I like the themes and fonts but there is one thing I wanted you to fix. It does not send automatically even if my signal is great. What is the reason? My message would be sent after 4 minutes and that's somewhat frustrating especially when you're in a hurry.",
      "Their are not a lot of choices for backgrounds and you can no longer use ur regular messaging. You have to use this app in order to text. I am going to uninstall it. I don't really like this app."
