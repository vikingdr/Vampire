      "I'll state my couple of drawbacks first to get those out of the way. Not all movies have captions, so options for the hard of hearing community are more limited. Lots of amateur movies, or flat out corny, particularly among sci fi, so if you don't like that there's that. That being said, many great movies are on here. It's accessible via computer or phone, super easy to navigate. Suggested options aren't repetitive. Ads are short, and allow for the best part. It's free",
      "I've just installed this and am about to watch my first movie on it. 5 stars for being free and transparent about how this app works...ie...ads. Given the current state of things with COVID-19 it's great to have this app to pass the time. I've only briefly glanced at the movie selection, but I'd like to see more current titles in the future. Lots appear to be old movies and/or ones I've never heard of. Hopefully I can leave my review at 5 stars after I've had more time to utilize it.",
      "Little specific complaints, but here's a few. Unique movies, nothing wrong with this just aren't my jam. I wanted to watch the film Rango, as shown in 2 of the images of the app, and it didn't have it, tad annoyed. Good interface Few ads Its free! I mean theres a chance I won't keep this forever but this is worth it as you lose nothing. Would recommend, 8/10",
      "Only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because you can't find \"common\" shows. Alot of \"knock-offs\". But it's free so can't complain too much. There's ads as if you're watching TV, but the app has to get paid somehow right? So long as we don't find out later that they steal or sell info, I don't have much to complain about. Will continue to use it till they run out of shows!",
      "I rated 4 stars bc nothing in life is %100 perfection. Everything's going to have a flaw.....the only issue here is the same as any other viewing platform is that there are ads . Eventhough ads are necessary, there are only a couple spots throughout a full show where ad commercials popped up. They were quick and painless! Great app.....love it....will keep it!! 🤘🤘"

      "For the older movies it just loads for forever you can't even click on the play button. If you do click on the play button it doesn't work it flashed the button green? This happens with some movies like clueless, pitch perfect, etc. With a lot of the other movies it says the movie link is broken? I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, it didn't help.(Edit the day after): They took of all the movies I listed and didn't even attempt to fix the problem? So now there's no good movies.",
      "Movie selection is great, but when I search for a movie -- that I know is 100% on this app -- NO results are ever found! Further, when I click on any title to get it's details, and then navigating back to all of the movie listings, I am returned to the very top of the list. Aggravating, because if I've scrolled down far enough during a search, I have to then find where I left off.",
      "Put simply, the list of films on offer is not exhaustive but they are free, so there are no complaints from me on this end. Also, I've had to \"struggle\" with the ads - one before the film started. The only thing I could recommend would be to allow the use of an external video player, like VLC or MX Player, or try to build casting functionality into the inbuilt video player. Otherwise a good little app.",
      "OMG! I never imagined that I would find such an app. It has enough recent movies and it doesn't buffer for long. I was about to give it 10 🌟 when I realized that there are only 5 🌟. Well done developer. But then, is there no way I can Pay or subscribe (just like Netflix), say for a month or more instead of using Wi-Fi or mobile data. I would really love that feature. Thanks once more for this app developer. Cheers.",
      "Very satisfying to easily search, play and cast. Although at times it does pause and disconnect. However I do not believe it is the program itself. All things considered most likely with my internet living in a rural area. Could very well be the program I used to mirror/cast my phone the tv's through Roku. Other than that I would recommend this to anybody interested in watching good quality movies. Quick tip; unless you want the close captions turn it off as soon as the movie starts."

      "Will agree with people saying this app use to be great. I loved watching movies from Google play. But recently I rented The Joker but it was wasted money instead because I kept getting a message that said it can not playback and something about needing chromecast. It's a bummer because I was really looking forward to watching that movie. Now I cant watch any one the movies I've purchased in the past. I'm so sad 😭😭😭",
      "I love using this app for most of my digital media purchases. One problem, though and I'm not sure if it's being looked into or how deep it goes. I think whoever is in charge of creating thumbnails is completely unprofessional. My example is The Magicians in the newer seasons, whoever created the thumbnails is intentionally picking characters making a \"goofy\" face. Season four is a very emotional and powerful season, but the thumbnails created for it make it out to be a complete joke!",
      "Used to be ok but now useless. I keep getting an error when trying to play anything in my library. The error says 'this type of playback isn't supported and I need to use Chromecast instead of mirroring' But I'm not trying to mirror my screen, just watch on my phone. Tried reinstalling the app but no difference. Used to work fine til yesterday so now my movie collection which I have paid alot of money to Google for is not accessible! Needs to be fixed urgently.",
      "1st, it's absolutely ridiculous that with an Android TV Box you CAN NOT download a content unless you use WiFi! I have a much faster Ethernet connection but it says I have to use WiFi! That is completely stupid! Second, you download the videos and good luck finding them. Of course even though I bought them there is no standard video file in the locations it says movie / tv files or stored, whether I tell it internal or SD Card. I'm disappointed I didn't know these things before I bought content. Just having to switch my box back forth from Gigabit Ethernet to WiFi is bad enough then to not be able to move them to my 2TB hard drive simply adds insult to injury!",
      "Its a really great app. But when ever I'm trying to play some of the TV series. I purchased some episodes won't play. It keeps on saying error and try to restart my device if problem persists. I tried that. And it isn't working. And I still can't watch my purchased movies. When they are downloaded. Only on wifi. Please fix this"

      "Took me a while to do a review as I wanted to try it out for a few weeks first and for me its probably the best movie app that's FREE that I have come across. Good selection of movies from oldies to latest. A few Ads which are very few, and none during movies.. Only one thing that would make it a perfect 5/5 for me is for it to have a Cast function.",
      "Has some decent movies on it. Could be a lot easier to navigate and use though. Search bar does NOT work. Was watching a movie earlier from the trending section went to go back and pick up where I left off. The movie is gone. No way of getting back to it either.",
      "I dont like that if you stop the movie. You can pick back up if you have to close the app. But have to start it over. I have seen and used other apps that keep a \"history \" of your shows or movies. Then let's you remove them after if you have to stop in the middle. Other than that a few less apps every time you go to read info about another movie it's a great thing. Maybe let you look into 2 or 3 movies before showing a app. But every time to read gets old. And then takes you back to the start.",
      "Exactly as advertised. Free movies. There are adds, but they're minimal and only on selecting a movie, not during. Good selection of new and older movies. Only reasons for 4 stars 1) navigation is a little wonky. Would like to see genre search. 2) Cannot exit a movie and pickup where I left off. Other than those things, this is a great app. Edit: on second thought, I'm changing to 5 stars. The issues are minor, and how often do you find a free app that does exactly as advertised?",
      "I have just downloaded and just picked a movie and have not had any issues For what I have experienced so far the app opened, ok good. The menu for the movie genre was functioning properly scrolling no problem. Movie choices and genres great Now after using for while no problems downloading or lags and movie quality is HD looks great. would recommend trying it .love the movie picks to choose from"

      "A very nice app in the free streaming service category. It has a very good selection for my age demographic. I am, however, only giving 4 stars because it lacks one feature for use on my device: there is no way to clear the \"Continue Watching\" feature. Sometimes you may begin a movie or show that you don't want to continue (because you've changed your mind once it began). How do you clear that feature? Please fix this and I'll gladly add the final star.",
      "Interface is fine for a free streaming app. 8 commercials per movie is tolerable considering how, again, it's free. That being said, is it really too much to ask that I'm able to enjoy what I'm streaming? The ads conveniently play perfectly every time. The movie/TV part however, not so much. My screen kept freezing as audio continues to play and then turns green. This happened several times within the first 20 minutes of just one movie. I'm sorry, but that makes it unbearable to watch.",
      "Seemed to be okay at first my first time watching a movie, that is until I experienced the ads. I'm not opposed to some ads by any means, it is free after all. The problem is they run choppy, sometimes out of sync with voice. The time doesn't match up. It will go back to the movie for 3 seconds, then go back to the ads all over again as if I hadn't watched the ads at that interval yet. After what was supposed to be like 1 minute of ads to continue watching, I was really at 3 or 4 minutes.",
      "I love the variety of movies & shows. They have regular, but not too many commercials. But this site does need work. When watching a tv show you cant easily get to the next episode. When opening the app at another time it will start the series over from the beginning instead of the next episode. It doesn't really let you make a list of shows & then get to that list. I am looking forward to improvements & an update.",
      "ZERO STARS. I tried watching movies on CRACKEL but VOLUME LEVEL WAS SO LOW~ ~>Icouldnt even HEAR THE MOVIE enough to tell what was going on. Maddening!. I used the closed captioning because I am severely hearing-impaired CLOSED CAPTIONING. It's not enough I can hear well enough to watch movies other apps! If that wasn't enough when the ads came on it blasted me out of my seat and I had to move my phone over 2 feet away from ME it was SO DARN LOUD! If you're handicapped, I highly advise against"

I also like that I can stream films in which some of the ones available for streaming are free.

It was at one point an extremely efficient way to look up movies and actors, to see what critics had to say about them, and to run through upcoming trailers. I found some of my favorite movies that way. All of those things still exist, but they are drowning in unnecessary schlock/ads/\"news\" on celebrities. Do you like Facebook? Well, this is like that, except take out all of the people you know and make it worse. Also it's yellow.",
      "Esta muy bueno. Ofrece muchos programas para todas las edades. Tambien las noticias deĺ dia. Informacion sobre la pandemia. Which is very helpful!! Thanks to all of you for your hard work especially on stay home days!!",
      "Good ap but somewhat a pale shadow of the website. An old review of mine was fixed: viz - Fix this disastrous update! No pics! Yes, may I add to the chorus of complaints that on my tablet (Huawei android v7) not a single picture of any sort now appears [except the ads!]. So not quite an advertisers dream. Videos like trailers do however play OK, despite the fronting still appearing blank. Someone's face is red right now (I hope)"

Then Ads free. It's great. I love. I used to use showbox apk. Until they shut it down. But out of all the apps. I literally download and wasted my time on. This is literally the best one. I'm on Google all the time so i know my review's are trust worthy. Lol",
      "Hands down the best free tv/movie app out right now. The bug fixes are great, but you should have kept the 10 second rewind button on the player, and as long as they keep up on adding new movies and tv shows, and work on upgrading movies from cam footage to hd format then i will be giving 5 stars ^-^",
      "I can no longer see anything, as I try to click my selection an ad always appear. Creating a never ending circle of cat and mouse to watch anything. I used to be satisfied with this app, NOT ANYMORE.",
      "This app is not good I do not recommend it. It has a lot of adds and it's annoying and the adds are so long. Sometimes it takes forever to load. And it forces you to rate it. If you dont then you cant watch your movie or show. To be honest this app sucks. I absolutely do NOT recommend.",
      "I recommend this app ot has tons of new movies and old. So far I have found every movie and tv show I looked for and been able to watch it with no problems. Lots of adds but its free so nothin to complain about in my opinion."

      "Convenient and super nice that it has everything all in the app. One stop shop. The service fee is annoying but I don't see anything outside of matinee times really and I'm a crown club member so it all works out. You can watch trailers for all movies and no need to look up individual theatres.",
      "Easy to use, a few fixes could make it great. Overall the app is really good. Lots of theater options, trailers and I like the QR codes for tickets. My only complaint is, depending on how you select the theater, sometimes the movie showtime buttons don't show up fully on the screen. Probably an aspect ratio issue, as you can see part of the buttons but can't read the times. Also, I wish the qty selection wouldn't take you to another screen. Just put +/- buttons to select qty of tickets.",
      "Needed to change the movie time after already purchasing my tickets. Was able to do so with the app in just a few seconds, no hassle or extra fee. Great deal considering I just spent 20mins on the phone with the movie theater trying to resolve this same issue (with no real help btw) before realizing it could be done with the app smh. Get/explore/use the app!",
      "I absolutely hate the full-screen popup ads every time I open the app and occasionally while I am searching through movies or theaters. I am here because I am buying movie tickets! You already have my business! You do not need to advertise to me! I have lost count of how many times I have actually clicked on an ad that popped up right when I was about to tap on something else, and it's a terrible user experience all around."

      "Great quality, very little ads, hardly any buffering, am very satisfied with this app. A dream come true for movie lovers who wanna watch their movies on their phones. My only suggestion would be that it would make it even way better, if there are more 80s and 90s films, rather than just the commonly known films. Don't get me wrong, this app has a great selection of films but I'd love to watch more films from those eras. I usually don't write a review but this app is worth rating for 👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "Very good app brilliant to use and very user friendly. The search button is a great feature as a lot of the apps that I have tried don't have a search button. I also really like the ability to download movies - this makes long car journeys a lot less boring! The only downside is that some movies aren't on there such as back to the future 2 & 3. If I could see these films added it would be a definite 5 star review. Great little app. 👍",
      "I really didnt expect it to have as many movies as they do! There are so many GOOD movies and soo many better ones than majority of these other free apps. My son and i love this app. Lots and lots and lots to chose from. There is one movie i havent came across yet that i would LOVE to see, \"P.S. I Love You\"... Any way u guys can add it to the app?",
      "It's cool because I can watch movies that had come out like the Joker 2019 movie but it's annoying when it adds random movie that you haven't even watched to the \" recently watched\" category, and then sometimes you have to do something with the add below to watch the movie but it's an ok app",
      "Its very hard to find a loyal app like this one, free to download and watch HD movies like *720p* OR *1080p* and its amazing with 1 or 2 ads, its just so perfect just the app im looking for, like no other words can explain it. Thanks To the developers, keep up the good work!"

      "This was the best. Since I've had my Note 10+, about a month, this app was working great. Why did you have to ruin it? While there was room for improvement, the new channel listing stinks. In portrait, the picture shrinks to a ridiculously small thumbnail, if you want to browse through the list while watching something else. Show info is gone. Often,the list is mostly blank. But worst... the show's are constantly buffering. Thanks for breaking what really didn't need fixing.",
      "Latest update looks nice, but it's missing a key feature and the usability has decreased. (1) Favorites are missing. (2) Vertical categories requires more scrolling and tapping than the useful horizontal menu. (3) Last channel viewed is not remembered after closing and reopens to a different channel. (4) Picture-in-picture no longer works. Despite these issues, this is still my favorite TV app.",
      "I definitely don't like the updated version of the Pluto TV at all. It takes too long to start. It doesn't restart on the previous channel that you watched. I can't change the channel like the older version. I have to turn off the Pluto TV to get to a station that I like. I'm thinking about uninstalling the Pluto TV app. It doesn't list the shows anymore on the updated version. What happened to the Wahlburgers TV Show in the 300s channel? Overall I'm Very Much Disappointed in the updated version",
      "Newest update turns itself on despite force closing it repeatedly. That is UNACCEPTABLE from a streaming app. Your privacy policy reads like the former Soviet Union's bill of rights. There aren't any, you mine horrifying amounts of very personal data (name, ph number, email, home address, etc) and give full access to multiple 3rd parties. Want my ss # and bank PIN too?!?",
      "Worked great until it updated, use to load up fast and not freeze, now it lags, the color guide was better than the black and white guide now, pictue is clear I must say, I know it's free, but if it's not broke, don't fix it. I do recommend this app for an alternative to watch tv on the go."

      "It works, not as well as Movie box or Showbox did, but it works. I had to uninstall it though because I eventually tracked down the constant Google Play Services battery drain on my phone to this app. Obviously something constantly going on in the background even when the app is not running. I suspect constant location requests but can't confirm that. Definitely will leech off your battery though.",
      "Not too bad. Not crazy about the the interruptions everytime you trying to open a movie or show. Searching for the TV show is appalling, you spend hours scrolling down. When you do find what you looking for, you spend hours again searching for the next session. I'm personally not interested in reality shows. Give an opinion to search, what you looking for please. There is a lot that you can not open.",
      "That was awful. There aren't any settings. I can't create lists. Yeah, awful. I've had the best app twice now and it's disappeared twice now. Can't find anything to compare to the one the got away, yeah, twice. All my shows are backed up with trakt.tv and I'm looking for something that will use that information. This isn't it.",
      "Excellent has all the movies I want see and TV series ads are some times tedious I am glad I am using this app it is the best for me so far no problems. But must update to latest version old version cannot use.the new version is better Hd movies 2020 This version has adds at the begining when starting the movie or series but these not last long I can enjoy the movie or series with no more adds occur when you open the connection to movie. I watch everyday you not have to pay it's free to watch .",
      "it looks like the cool one but a lot lamer. ads all over the screen. the one that I use on my other devices still work fine but this one is a hastle and annoying and I have yet to even try to watch anything because I couldn't find anything i was looking for or options for search or to even type the name. horrible copycat of the good one that looks like this and i just watched star wars with. neg 5stars"

      "Everything u touch or search gives an ad and when I went on download the 2020 one it said that this version is out of date and needs updating so go to update it and it makes me download this one. Haven't started watching anything yet but would also prefer if there was a better layout of the movies and not just shoved onto a few pages. Edit-watched one movie fine but now won't let me watch any others as the url is empty and I have tried 5 times in the past 3 days.",
      "This is an app where it is worse than the one I used by this studio and the old one gave me the best rips of movies you can find but this is just a crappy way of just clicking on a movie and it just gives you crappy YouTube videos were they are either high pitched and have a background of the avengers or something like that or the same but without the high pitched sound. LAME!!!!",
      "Look I love this app to death. And I understand ads when you play the movie. But every couple pages that you're looking through for a movie?!! Come on! Please remove ads from browsing. Its such a pain. Other than that great app!!! Try not to put cam movies on there please. Thanks.",
      "Great app. And its free. Movies play clear for the most part. With few comercials that play without interrupting the movies. Also the it has all the latest movies with very good quality to be a free app im pleasantly surprised. Hope it continues to be as good as it is.",
      "While this does have ads. Its usually 30 seconds before movie starts or when ya change pages. Not a hassle at all. People with few brain cells think its too much to watch ads to keep sites free....... 3 days later quits working.. Never mind"

      "I love this app. I have over 1,000 movies and I always buy more when I'm out at yard sales and I use to guess what I had, then I typed out all my movies but I wanted something easier to use. This saved me so much time and energy and it's cool cause if I scan a movie I already have it tells me that way I dont buy the same movie by mistake. Plus u can sort by movies, tv shows or look up specific actors and it will tell u every movie u own with them in it!",
      "Creates a great DVD/Blueray library. Its has been perfect as I am trying to rebuild my collection. The scan function makes it very easy. The only issues are you cannot edit if it was scanned and you cannot input a ISBN number manually and have it find it on the Database. These are minor and it allows me to quickly check while shopping if I have the movie in DVD or if I am thinking of one that I used to have or have on streaming. It has saved me far more money in mistakes than it costs.",
      "I had been looking for an app to inventory my DVD/Blu Ray collection since I was tired of buying something only to realise that I already had it! My Movies not only does the job but it looks great while doing. It provides plenty of customisation options to optimise the look and feel of your library. Adding titles is simple and customer support are on the ball if you have any issues or need to add titles to their database. Very happy with this app!",
      "Excellent App! Years ago I had an app that I liked for cataloging my movies. But it stopped being supported. I've been looking for a while for something to replace it. This app is even better that the other one. I love that it lets me default the group when entering in new movies. And the ability to catalog digital media.",
      "This is a fantastic app! I have so many movies to keep track of and there hasn't been more than a handful of titles that weren't already in their database. Helping to add them was simple as well. With lots of filter and customization options it's difficult to find fault with it at all."

      "All the new movies i picked to watch were good quality and loaded fast with no buffering. Only 1 movie didnt load n i seem to only have issues with the same movie on every app i try to watch it on... This app is awesome.. Also it even plays the newest movies out.",
      "App works fine. Never a problem. Always great movies, selections and quality. I think most bad ratings are from either competitors and or people who dont know what they're doing. App is so easy to use, my 10yr old uses it on his android tablet with no issues just like I use it on my Samsung android phone with no issues. Reccomend to all as a must have movie app.",
      "Watched one movie now it only buffers . Update now it won't even buffer it closes befor it loads . Watched one movie with plenty of pauses while it buffered. If you like watching the little red circle spin around this app is for you. Minus 1 star",
      "I just got this app from a friend..just started trying to watch two different movies and i got up until the last 20 mins of one movie and it stopped and wouldnt come back up.and tje other movie i couldnt get past the first 5 mins. I read other peoples reviews and apparently there going through the same thing ive been going through..App would be ok if these issues were fixed..frusterated in Missouri..",
      "For one thing the damn app like the freezer movies that you're watching and then it takes 30 seconds to 3 minutes for it to start up again and then 30 seconds to a minute later it freezes again and it just continues like that it makes an hour and a half movie turn into a 4 and 1/2 5 and 1/2 hour movie and it blows this app can kiss my ass"

My list it is buggy cause if you have or try to add a show on your wishlist it sections it off to allll your lists that are new and just gets you lost. It was one click. We don't need a list page for shows and movies. We have sections that say movies and TV and wishlist if was fine. If we are to lazy to look through our stuff thats our fault. Why can I look at a movie that I don't own and put it in a list? Wishlist? Y",
      "I haven't been able to use disc to digital for months. This was the entire reason I started using VUDU in the first place. Every other app can locate my phone, but not VUDU, so it isn't my phone. It keeps saying location must match Billing address. I am at my Billing address and I used to use this service with no problem. They need to fix this bug or remove the location requirement. This is ridiculous.",
      "I love this app! I've been using it for a very long time. I love that the free movies don't have too many ads and the disk to digital is something I've used a lot. Thank you for adding the list feature too. I like being able to group movies together. Y'all just keep making this app better every time! It'll be 5 stars when I can export it to my sd card.",

      "Hulu live TV no ads it's a joke, every show I tried to watch has commercials. I cancelled, then resubscribed to get Hulu no ads for $11.99 a month, most all of the shows are actually commercial free. The only problem is the library is limited. ABC, NBC, and FOX shows are great with no ads. They have the current episodes, as well as classic TV shows. You have to wait until 2 am the next day to watch new episodes. You can watch General Hospital after 5pm the same day, which is cool .",
      "Hulu is great when it works, but that's only sometimes. The app is laggy and slow, plenty of weird errors, sometimes it just refuse to start. Poor customer service, almost no feedback when something goes wrong which is often. LiveTV crash or just refuse to work, and more commercials than you expect to see, especially if you pay for \"Hulu (No Ads)\" Will be looking elsewhere. I spend more time watching the free streaming services more, just because I'm sick of fighting with Hulu to get it to work correctly.",
      "Always something to watch and great selection. Just when you think you've watched everything you could possibly watch they come out with a new series or new movie. My favorite are the Hulu Originals those are some of the best TV shows the movies I've seen yet. I watch Hulu on a regular basis probably about oh I'd say an hour or two a day every day of the week and I'm still finding new stuff I've never run out not to mention they have way better programming than Netflix. So yes I like my Hulu.",
      "Love this app. Beat the area cable company by a mile. Always something to watch and the DVR is amazing. Just one problem the past few days. It has started to buffer a lot. Thought it might be a device cleaning issue. But cleaning doesn't help. Hoping the new update will take care of this. Other than that, I love this.",
      "Every update stops working. Somehow when you go to Hulu help it is always your device that is supposedly the problem. Every other streaming service works just fine oily problem is Hulu. Now if I travel I have to connect to my home network. Seriously, the idea of me paying for a streaming service is so I could login and use it on my tablet or computer while traveling. Price keeps going up and service keeps getting worse. Too many other services out now to stay with Hulu."

      "This is my second review, the other was deleted & not by me! Very disappointed, you get to view 1 movie, intermittently, then forced to upgrade to remove adverts, because adverts stop the other films loading. It kept disconnecting from Chromecast. Mediocre films & not many to choose from.",
      "This app is useless. Every time I trieded to select a movie it never played. The ads always played, so I guess the app's getting something from each failed attempt to watch a movie... Ad revenue! Deleted this app after writing this review - save yourself the trouble and don't bother.",
      "Rather a nice App. Seems to work very well. Could certainly do with more Hedy Lamarr films though. The reason for a 4 rather than a 5 is that it doesn't work on Android 4.x meaning my smart projector (and a lot of Android boxes) are sadly locked out.",
      "After some initial difficulties in getting the ads removed on two devices, (which has now been resolved), I can say that this is a brilliant app for anyone who loves old movies.",
      "So I'm giving it a 3 star because I haven't even downloaded it yet, but just the idea of this app got me giddy! I really really hope they have old Disney classics like \"the seventh brother\" or the one with the troll with the green thumb and even all dogs go to heaven or the fox and the hound.

      "This is a terrible app. Adds are constant and play *over* the movie. They interfer with the loading of the movie, frequently causing movie playback issues. This program uses pirated movies that can be sent to be clearly made in a movie theater (people seen moving around, talking, etc ). This, in addition to the annoying adds playing over the movie, shows how morally bankrupt the developers are. Total trash.",
      "This is good as the how people upload the movies, HD, 720p 1080p, CAM only, but some movies are clear even its cam only, but for me it's Okay! thank you to the people who have time to upload movies and share it to us! keep up the good work guys, and for those who said it's only trailers! yes it is but just keep watching trailers sign out close the app. you'll be surprised! when you run it again!",
      "The app is great because i opened the app and it worked perfectly.Also the trailers are good and work good.Also, the trailers have a good amount of time.Another thing is that when i opened the app it didn't take a long time to load.I really liked the trailer onward.I also like the new sonic movie trailer.I want to watch the movie frozen 2.I really just enjoy watching movie and series and trailers.So, in conclusion, i really would like suporting this app bye giving HD Movies five stars.so it good",
      "I don't like the pop up messages that I get at the top. Like the ones about a girl who is one mile away half naked and other messages about me winning prizes i don't like it...i have kids who use my phone or try to sneak a look while I'm watching a movie. I love the app but i don't love what's happening when i start to watch a movie.",
      "Its very good i can now see movies for free , without paying for ticket in the cinemas. It has a vide range of movies and tv shows which opens through mainly 3 servers. Thank you guys after my board exams i can spend time by watching movies and tv shows on your app . I am not payed to write these things down here, but I geneunely like this app. Thank you guys:)!!!!!...."

A few 2019 movies: Joker, doctor sleep, avengers endgame, Zombieland dbl tap. It seems like almost every movie up to the end of 2019. Thank you developers!

But all of a sudden when I click on the app it wont show the movies anymore and when I try and click on a movie I favorited it closes down the app. What do I do?",

      "For some old reason the audio doesn't line up with video I tried doing it again and again with no avail. I know you can just record the audio separately and place it in there I'm trying to edit a 30 minute video until less than 15 minutes and plus your phone doesn't have that much storage so if you record your audio separately you run out of storage. If anyone is thinking about getting my movies I will recommend using any other editing software.",
      "Omg!! Omg!! This is an amazing app!! I am so happy that you can get vip effect by watching vids!!! It's amazing!! I never saw an app like this :) And i am so happy that the watermark is so small not like others. It's the best app. I rlly recommend for you to donwload. THIS IS RLLY RLLY AMAZING IF YOU WANT TO EDIT YoOUR VIDS!! Edit: i gave this app 5 stars this is an amzing app for the 100th time",
      "Whenever I got done editing, at some parts it just showed grey and a few colors at the top. I checked to see if it was my phone and it was your editor, I recommend you fix this, because you don't know how long that video took to make, and this has happened multiple times, fix it, please and thank you.",
      "Limits: One audio track, no pip, no audio fade. No custom background. Good: Zoomable timeline! Watermark removed by ads. Good UI on clip import. Speed (1/2x to 2x); volume adjust; \"crop\" tool includes zoom, warp, flip, arbitrary rotation; great photomanip includes white balance, saturation, contrast; clip reverse; text feature is easy and plenty of options, including animations; No apparent limits on exporting, file size, text/image layers. Paid options can be \"bought\" with ads. Best so far.",
      "When I used this app it removed my audio that I had in it while I was editing! Other then that it's an amazing app!!! Okay so it was the actual sound I had with the video when I was recording. Then I added music to it and I was watching the video over again in the app and it sounded fine until I downloaded it to my camera app. I decided to watch the video with the camera app and half way through the video it was just silent. It was really wierd so that's what happened!"

      "Was good, but now crashed to 2/5. None of my earlier issues (below) addressed & recent update removes favourite flags, which I used to mark films I own - system now useless. Years later, still no way to add 1) missing movies or 2) alternative titles/original foreign titles if not included, or 3) viewing notes (where I could insert alternative titles, as well as my personal notes). Plus 4) titles starting The/A are listed under The/A, which is not standard practice and lacks logic. Disappointing.",

      "Better than CineTrak so far. The UI has exactly what I wanted both movies and tv series with next episodes releases. It syncs up very well with Trakt. Hope to get premium service after this review. Jajaja yeah right!!!"

Some keep making you watch Ad after ad and not playing the movie at all. Just infinite ads. It's like hit and miss. Win some lose others. Bad Boys for Life still have no Sound, Russell Peters Deported won't play. Frozen 2 stops work after so much in the beginning of the movie. When these things are fixed I will bum the score up.

Loved it, would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat, it was cheaper because they didn't have to make as many DVDs cut down the prices for the movie companies...then Fandango bought it...you can't earn discounts with purchases, and now it is just as expensive to buy a movie on this app as it is to go out and buy the DVD. From $19.99 to $27.99?! It's now cheaper at the stores to buy the actual disc!",

I'm fine with that but I think if you pay for movies there should be more than one language? Not a big issue but definitely fixable!! Love the app for 4k though loll!"

Horrible",

      "I love this app. Because it has so many great movies and TV. a lot of the movies and TV shows that is on here I do watch on a day-to-day basis. Is better than having cable TV. Cuz it don't book a whole whole lot",
      "I love the app, it's has my favorite shows. But I wish it had all the episodes without you having to unlock them.",
      "The variety of shows and episodes is great. But my biggest issue using the APP is everytime it goes to commercial break I get the message \"Something Went Wrong\" and it goes back to episode selection screen. I also wish, after you logged in and made an account, there was a tab that shows you what shows you've been watching.",
      "Literally works about 25% of the time. Some shows are inaccessible because the app crashes completely if you click on it. At least once per show it will crash randomly for no reason, then it's 50/50 if you'll be able to get back to that episode. The most recent season of MAFS only displays 1 episode but there have obviously been more. And you CAN watch them - if you start at the beginning and scroll through to the end of each episode it will automatically go to the next one. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!!!"

      "Worst App Ever. (Sony Smart TV) Every time we paused a show, we had to back all the way out, come back in, resume. Then, it stopped working altogether. Had to uninstall app, reinstall it, then do the \"run to the computer, log in, enter the six digit code\" dance. I'll also say that the selection, many which are duplicated on Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+, isn't worth the price. Didn't even finish the free trial. We're done with it.",
      "Terrible Terrible Terrible I mean for $5.99 there's a lot more value out there I will be cancelling I've truly given this app an honest shot as I do like some of your entertainment offerings but can't deal with the constant buffering freezing casting issues from my Brand new Samsung Galaxy S 10 C'mon guys get it together heard it was better but couldn't try trial again and so I paid will not pay again till I know for sure. Thanks Rip off Rip off Rip off Rip off Rip off",
      "Absolutely horrible selection of tv shows and movies, it's asinine that they want money for such a horrible app. There's several free apps that have a much better selection of tv and movies.",
      "I've never used this app I have been trying to cancel my subscription since the first month you charged me bout a year please tell me how to uninstall before bill is due again...very unhappy with this... and guess it's okay if you like old movies...but I do not thank you...",
      "I don't understand. Why can I not watch Epix on my computer? I was really excited to start Deep State, but I can only run Epix on my phone. I'm very disappointed. I don't want to pay money to have to watch what I want on a 3 inch screen."

      "I watched the Terminator and it was fantastic, I automatically gave this app a 5 star rating, then I tried watching jumanji; the next level...1st of all there was some ad for gambling that would slowly scroll down the screen at the beginning of the movie in not 1but 3 maybe even 4 languages before you actually see the movie, but then the sound was so muffled it didnt matter the volume it was at. Perhaps this isnt all movies, so I'm willing to try one more time, til then I give this app a 3.",
      "It's good... Just needs a little more time for further tweaks. Say like.. links for subtitles 'especial in Eng'. Some Download Links are dead. Might wanna check that out. But overall its a good application. Will look forward for whats to come. Thank you",
      "Most the movies play with no ad interuption and in good quality, some movies play with ad interuption and it's tolerable except when the ad stays on the entire movie and blocks the picture. That's my only complaint. But i love this ap it's easy to use and it works for me.",

I hope that the developer refund my money for this useless application.",
      "I've tried making a lot of videos and this is the one that I have really been looking for. In this app, you can control the music on where it starts or and ends,it would let you switch the sequence. But I just don't like the 'pro' thing though. It limits the transitions and the effects",
      "This is a really good app. Although, if you don't like there music your going to have to download your own. As well as paying for transitions?!?! Everything else is AMAZING except for the glitches then taking me out of where I was editing at... but i suggest you to use this app because they still have transitions, and if it take you out then you can either finish it later or at the moment, they have stickers, fonts, colors, and you can even take out the background of your pictuere!! DOWNLOAD IT!",
      "First of all, everything is looking good. 2.35:1 ratio, many options of transitions. But I am experiencing a glitch in every beginning and ending of transitions. When the transitions begins and ends, some frames seems missing so between video-transition-video is not smooth. Please fix this",
      "This is a great app! I've been using it for my YouTube channel and it's absolutely amazing!! It does have some things that cost money (the pro version) but unlike other apps this app has so many cool free transitions and other stuff! With most editing apps I've used all the good transitions usually cost you to have premium but this app does not! It's amazing"

      "I love AMC theaters and the A-List program but this app is terrible. It is slow and always a bottleneck to every movie going experience. I have had it for years across several phones and it's never changed. Between trying to get your ticket out to scan versus your membership barcode is a real pain. I have my membership code stored in Google pay and just end up using that for scanning purposes most times. With the recent coronavirus update the app crashes when opened from a push notification.",
      "Awesome app. Little upset about Alist fee not being refunded for month paid for and theaters are closed due to CoVid-19. No free on-demand for compensation. Next month accounts will be paused only. For those who already paid for month of March no refund or no movies to watch. Little unfair for those who have paid already there fee for the month.",
      "Second day of a weekend that the app is crashing soon after opening and is unusable. I use automatic update and even reinstalled the app yesterday after the crashing started. I'm an A-List member and now cannot use my phone to get a seat and check in at the theater. I may be demanding a refund for each day this app is unusable. Their easy money in this time of COVID-19 might go away if this app isn't fixed.",
      "As an A-List member, I am pleased with the layout and functionality of this app. My two suggestion to make the ap better. I wish purchased tickets were one click accessible. Currently you have to did to get to your tickets, unless you purchase them and leave the QR code up on the screen. We buy our tickets way in advance, often for multiple showing so this isn't possible. I also wish there were filter options for genre and release date in the \"coming up\" section. Dreamers can dream, right?",
      "App updated with new stability fix to make the experience more enjoyable instead the app crashes every 1 second after trying to open to see anyting. for the amount of money we pay to see movies this shouldn't be happening Cinemark hasn't working just right. Fix it my membership is worth more than this trash."

This app does have a few times where it will be fixing itself, but over all it's the best movie app I've encountered!!!",

Im considering cancelling my subscription.",
      "The HBO app constantly kicks me out of the video saying they can't play the video, forces me to go back to then relaunch the video. I watched a movie where I had to do this about 50 times no joke, this is the most annoying Thing of this app. It would be one thing if it didn't happen on every show but it happens every single program I've ever watched and HBO since the moment I installed this app. I hope HBO has a fix for this because I can't believe I'm the only one that this is happening to",
      "Not 1 video played without issues? HBO is the most expensive and buffers more then it plays? I wish they would give me my money back which i know they wont, being the crooks they are but you sure as hell should allow me to cancel which it doesnt? Too many sites offer better service for free, then HBO charges you for lesser quality service? Look at all the bad reviews, their only message is \"our support team would like to hear more about our issues?\" All the same! How bout a refund!$$$",
      "I'm paying $25 a month so that ten minutes into a movie the app can stop working. Permanently. Turn the console off, uninstall the app, switch to a computer, it doesn't matter, the playback ends and won't go past the marker it first buffered at. And yes, it's across all my devices. I can watch Netflix, Hulu and Prime all in 4K but HBO, the most expensive one, crashes constantly. According to the help line, my internet download/upload and latency is more than DOUBLE what HBO requires to playback HD video. Their solution? To email me later when the \"app developers\" think of something. So answer me something. Why am I paying a monthly rate that is bonkers expensive compared to other streaming services for an app that quite actually has more buffering than a movie streaming site that will show me this title for FREE? The only thing this app has going for it is the original content which, while great, you can find anywhere else online with less buffering. And that doesn't cost you $25 a month.",
      "Frustrating interface that is not intuitive. No movie information page is available, it just immediately plays the movie with any touch, useless. Category organization is not employed unless an alphabetical only listing of every movie is the only category. Chromecast functionality appears to work."

      "The best app for movies hands down. Don't even bother trying any other app because I already did and this is the best even works on fire stick with the fire remote , just make sure you are using a vpn thought , like IP Vanish or the equivalent .",
      "It worked perfectly fine the first couple of days... Then it would be longer load videos no matter how much I restarted my phone, chose different links etc..",
      "it was good and now its kind of bad it buffers a lot my rating will go back to 5 stars when It's fixed , because im trying to watch supernatural"

      "I can't believe there's no way to limit the app to showing movies playing LOCALLY! I hate seeing that my favorite retro film is playing, only to click on it and see it's only playing 300 miles away! The movies are also listed very haphazardly under the 3 categories (now playing, coming soon, event cinema) so that a retro movie might be listed under coming soon or event cinema, no evident rhyme or reason to which one. It makes it hard to find things.",
      "It should automatically go to the cinema that I have chosen as my home Cinema and it doesn't. I have tried to purchase tickets but it will not let me. Last week I could check seating, but this week I can't. I have tried calling the cedar Creek theater, but they don't answer their phone. We live over an hour away and I don't want to drive all the way there to find out that because of Corona, the 50% seating available is all sold out.",
      "app crashes. I have to pay user fee $3.5 for tickets that cost $10 because it can't find my reward card . it keeps saying my last name is wrong. I can't set up new account . I have been trying for weeks. I'm not happy at all with this new version. I wish I could rate it a zero!!! Update 2/26/20 not working again. I have to use fandango.",
      "Wish that when I order on line there was the military discount option. It would also be nice to be able to preorder and pay for meals on line. Outside of these two issues, love how this app has changed the theater experience.",
      "Marcus Theaters are the BEST! They make you realize that AMC theaters are garbage. I love their theaters and $5 Tuesdays and comfortable seats with lots of leg room and this app which lets me choose my seat ahead of time so I don't have to fuss with that when I get there. Download this app."

I've tryed to uninstall, update even restart my phone and app a few times but nothing seems to fix the video from pausing. I really like this app and I hope this bug gets fixed soon...",
      "At first the ads is bearable, but now the amount of ads are ridiculous! More than 10 ads shows up just to watch 1 movies or 1 episode! The worst part is that those ads shows up when we get into the app, when we clicked on the movie, when we click the \"watch\" button for the movie, when the movie is about to play, even the ads keep show up continuously while the movie is playing (which ofcourse would block us from watching it) not worth it at all!🤬🤬🤬",
      "If I could I would give this app 0 star's because I have been using this app for a vary long time but now when I try to get on the app it said that free movies is not working and when I click report it takes me to the home screen I was very mad if you see this do not I rep pet do not install this app. ):",
      "Its ok apart from all the adds, plus when u update it, tv shows just vanish, its not the best no way near, but for free cant complain to much",
      "Look I don't mind ads because I know I'm getting something for free that people usually pay for. But come on, you can not tap on anything without an ad. And the app tends to forget you have already watched an ad and plays another ad. Also what is the point of asking if we would like to watch an ad to continue if you are automatically going to play ads after every tap anyway??? You make it seem like we have a choice. Other than that I love this app, just not the ads after every tap."

      "Easy to get tickets on-line, no brainer to join the Movie Club with discounted tickets, no on-line booking fee, 20% off concessions and special offers-seeing that I go to the movies at least once a month!! Reclining reserved seats are comfortable and sound is excellent. No more waiting/standing in lines in the lobby with your popcorn getting cold!! Love it🥰",
      "This app has been very helpful when it comes anything for movies, whether it's buying tickets, learning showtimes, and so forth. Cinemark has done well for themselves with this app. I was only using one other theatre chain's app, and it didn't work as well or was as intuitive as this one is. That is among the factors that not only won my loyalty; and led to my finally uninstalling the other app.",
      "Love it overall for the food discount and no fees for booking seats in advance. But I really wish they'd make a senior version that's $1 less than the regular membership because it's not as valuable to seniors otherwise and it would be a nice courtesy to seniors, who typically don't have as much income but do have time to go to movies. My friends and I (as seniors) aren't sure if it's worth continuing now that it's going up another dollar per month.",
      "The app is easy to use. It's convenient when I need my car code for my member discounts and to pick up tickets or go e-ticket. I like the member perks, like discounts on concessions and no online fees. What I would love to see this app improve is proving more payment options. There's no way to save more than on payment method on file, can't pay through PayPal or Visa. Adding more payment options would make the purchase process quicker and smoother.",
      "Today I experienced my first issue with the app and have been unable to get ahold of anyone to get the issue fixed. I selected my seated and needed to purchase one with my debit card. The transaction errored out, removed money from my account and removed those seats from being selected. I never received any confirmation or refund, nor have I been able to get in contact with anyone about w resolution. Movie day with the family...RUINED!"

One TV I own (Sony 4k Smart) It just will not work on. This Sony uses Android OS and the Google Play Store for apps. I can go right in and pull up Xumo for android tv's, install the app, but when i open the app. It will pull up just like it should then all of a sudden it closes. I have uninstalled, ✓'ed p'missions on tv. Idk? Anyone??",

As soon as I pick a channel it shows the first part, then it shows an ad, and then it starts over again. It keeps doing that that until it's time for the next movie. Then it starts doing that with the next movie. So you never get to actually see the show you wanted to watch in it's entirety.",

It's got some awesome shows and movies I want to watch but Everytime I go to watch something,an ad starts playing in the middle of the show and then the show starts from the beginning all over again.

The coming soon section is patheticly incomplete and inadequate. Seeing the promotions works less than half the time. No updates beyond adding trashy AR advertising. Shows Regal's true priorities, like replacing Coke with Pepsi, which nobody asked for. Thanks jerks.",
      "The refund request is broken, hasnt worked since I signed up at the beginning of the year. Also, doesnt say you can have only 3 movies so if you reserve a bunch in advances you cant do others. Works ok for popular movies but needs alot of work. Also, the movies arent free with Unlimited if you are still charging a convenience fee.",
      "I have Regal Unlimited. What they advertise is that the more you visit, the more points you earn for each visit in the Regal Crown Club (Emerald, Ruby, Diamond levels). What they don't tell you unless you can find the FAQs in the app (the site has a lot of dead links) is that you can have Regal Unlimited or the points for visiting, but not both. I entered into a year commitment because of misleading advertising.",

      "I try to get the app from my email. I could not. So it asked for my phone number. Ones I got the subscription through my phone number. I could not put my email in profile settings. Hence. Could not open it on my apple tv. Which is waste of money. How can I fix that.",
      "Worst app ever. There is no option to manage the subscription. If one click on subscription where manage your subscription was written, one can see only the next billing date and payment history. That's it. There is nothing to do with manage subscription. Also once you subscribe it will be on autopay mode and there is no way to stop this. There is no payment section where I can see the payment methods I have selected.",
      "I subscribed with 99 plan. Transaction went successful and the money got deducted. Still whenever I open the app it shows no content and askes me to subscribe, App suffers with network failure without any apparent reason. Why the Hell ?? Any kind of help will be highly appreciated. It's not a request, You must be Helpful. Because I deserve it.",
      "- App need to be more user-friendly its still under naive stage. - No forward option just like old days have to move the video playback slider. - Eros website from phone/mobile browser is more advanced and very organised then app. - Please have some basic three options for video quality low, medium, high kindoff rather then bunch of screen resolution with some kbps.",
      "My experience has been very sad... I love the access to movies but there is no way to download the app to use on my Xbox one.. Which is how I stream my content. Also once I have started watching a movie, there is no saving where I have stopped... So the next time I'd like to continue watching that selected movie, I have to start afresh by searching for the movie and trying to scroll thru and find where I stopped. I have many more issues sadly."

The truth is its worde then i first thought they start you off with free week trial and have optoon to say no as long as its before week is over.i started habing problems before first hour.then more problems when i couldnt get ajold of anyone from the app.i went to tjeir revoews and two rebiews sjowed as their rebiewd amd were possitivereviews",
      "$5.29 every month with recurring subscription. I don't think so. Your guide to find where a movie is streaming is handy but not worth $5.29 every Month. I'll stay using justwatch and firestick to find where to stream.",
      "One of the best apps I watched for tv.. however it does need to do a better job at stopping n replaying Frm same spot... n going to the next following episode... at the moment too much of a hassle to get back at same spot n to change to next episode",
      "I would give this app a 000 if I could . I am uninstalling. Several shows in watchlist I cant watch yet because they do not have them and the ones I want to I cant figure out how without needing to also purchase the app that show is on. So it is not clear how to us it."

I contact msp and they don't do anything about it, and I keep trying to. I also NEVER give out my account login info, or give clues AND my password is secure. Idk why, and my ac was I got hacked help on au server.",

Making it more recent, maybe use the gen z theme. But back to a complaint, you guys guy recolor clothing you've already released, it's boring. We want something new, not the same clothes in different colors.",
      "So, I used to play this game before and I loved it. My phone broke. I got a sony xperia 10 plus - a longer than normal screen. And now I dowoaded the game and half of the screen was covered in nothing ( just a black screen) and the other half was fine, so I couldnt log in nor make a new account nor make most of my avatar. Please help or I will be very sad and forced to leave this game for a very long time."

      "Amazing clarity, was very happy to find this on Google Play. Uninstalled all my apks now I don't feel guilty. I had no idea that Google had these. YouTube sometimes can mislead you. You have to search and read. Stay away from from APKS. They will cause you nothing but problems. Also get Google 's wifi boosters, I promise you that I know from experience they work.",

      "Streaming to tv has improved a lot, but you still cannot decide what level of HD you want to stream based on the bandwidth you have. You can do it for downloads, sort of (low/med/high), but this doesn't really tell you anything except for how many hours you can store. This is useless for phone users who may want to tailor the quality to their phone's resolution. Also, I think the older Simpsons episodes are still oddly cropped to fit 16:9, which cuts off some of the image.",
      "Lots of content, but the app is trash. The app is not at all feature-rich, and it is often glitchy. Most shows are 2min long, and it stops playback after every show. This drives my kids nuts, which in turn drives me nuts. I dont want to have to find and play a new episode every 2 min or less. Netflix has set the bar on what to expect from a streaming app, and disney cannot compete. Casting to another device, is never a smooth experience.",
      "Update March 22: after downloading an update for the app, now I can't watch anything. The audio come through but the screen just stay black. For all the shows and movies. Please fix. If you haven't update, don't do it!! __________________ Does not work in note 10 I have a note 10 plus and I get the error 83. Still waiting for the fix. Thanks.",
      "Got the app when it originally came out a few months back to watch the mandalorian... But the moment the season stopped I tapped out because the app does not work. It freezes. Audio de-syncs. Not worth the money when other streaming services can provide subtitles, and fluid streaming. And if you look up the problem it just falls back onto your internet speeds... which I do not have a problem with. I regularly sit at 24mbps. Disappointed and will be uninstalling again.",
      "Very, very frustrating. Since update about 2 weeks back, app allows log in and access to title select screen, then simply doesn't work. Wouldnt even run previously downloaded content. After an endless series of 83 errors, I reinstalled. Now, I get to the play screen, and get a never ending load screen. PERMIT USE TO STREAM IN BROWSER, INSTEAD OF YOUR APP THAT DOES NOT WORK."

You really need to go back to old rewards. Thank you, please listen to your Customers which seem like a lot of us. Or let us choose which program we would like. Again thank you.",
      "Waste of time. Disney Movie Rewards used to have great rewards like DVDs, Blu-rays and movie posters. This new \"Insiders\" program only has useless e-gift cards and digital nothings. They keep saying \"more physical rewards will be added in the future\" but notice how they never explicitly mention movies. This program is dead, there is no reason to collect points now.",
      "Less rewards than before, no way to sort or search based off of categories or point amount, and 99% of the \"rewards\" are just coupons for 25% off. This needs a total overhaul, and brought back to how it was when it was Disney Movie Rewards! It's pointless now.",
      "All the points I have collected, and now I can't use them!! All the rewards are completely useless to me. What a great way to slap your costumers in the face with such usless stuff! Coupons, what a joke! So does that mean I am going to lose all my points because I can't use them now? And don't give me that generic \"we're adding more rewards\" message you give to everyone! I want to be able to get DVDs, not coupons. It's not rocket science, that's why people collect points.",
      "This app is more difficult to navigate than the website disney movie rewards. On the web site i could use my points for purchading a number of things including some movies. I miss being able to do this you should reconfigure to make it more user friendly. And bring back some of the other features the website had. It was more user friendly so everyone can use it."

      "So far I really like the app, but the only thing that's holding it back from being the best that I've tried, is trying to scan VHS barcodes doesn't come up with anything even though it has a feature for it. Also when scanning in complete series of shows, it defaults to Blu-ray and you have to go in and singly select each season to which format that is. But the best thing about this app though, is it shows what format of the movie that you own in multiple formats.",
      "Really awesome!!! It's so easy to use this app and add all the movies scanning the barcodes. You can see all the information you need about every movie in a sight. Even you can watch the trailer in most of them. The only thing is that I would like to be able to sort the movies by kind of audience of every movie. I mean, \"G\" General Audience, \"PG\" Parent Guidance, you name it. Really good app anyway.",
      "I was using an excel spreadsheet for my collection before finding this. I collect VHS tapes. This has all the movies and all the formats. Lots of sorting and filter options. Keep in mind that over 40 movies, you have to buy the paid version (only $2). Great app that helps with organizing my collection. Highly recommend to collectors.",
      "Superb, all my movies on one app, plus backup, the downside about the backup is that it cannot be backed up to Google drive, to get it to be the same on my tablet I have to download it to a stick and then transfer it to the tablet, so much faffing about. If it could be downloaded to Google drive then I would definitely give it 5 stars.",
      "I've been searching for about a year now for the best movie inventory app, and this is definitely it. After you get used to how things work, you'll find this app works great and allows for some neat visual customisation options and smart optimisations for organising your collection. I'll likely buy the unlocker soon, as my movie collection is quickly reaching the 40 film limit set by this free version. Don't let that number scare you off though, this app is well worth downloading."

      "*edit to add* read the responses to other complaints. It is a cookie cutter response that doesn't have anything to do with the issues. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS APP!! My card just got charged and I can't even get into the app to watch anything. It keeps telling me network difficulties. I don't even know how I can get a refund and cancel my subscription. I am not going to pay for something I can't watch. Charged me after I asked them to cancel.",
      "Very poor service. I am having continuous problems. It keeps telling me I have too many devices logged in and I am only using it on 1 tv. It makes no sense. I have edited this review on 3/20/20. They did not help me at all by email. I emailed them at the time I started having problems and I replied with the information they requested. The only way I got the problem solved was by actually calling the help line. You will be on hold for awhile but since I called I have not had anymore problems!",
      "This app is great when it works. I'm paying for a subscription and I can't even watch anything. Everytime I log in and then go to play a movie it logs me out and takes me back to the login screen. I've tried force stop and restart, uninstall and restart and it still does it. Please help. I'm very frustrated.",
      "The movies and shows are the expected fare, though there are a couple of titles that are older Pixl shows I'm surprised not to find here. My biggest issue is that the app randomly kicks me off without warning and asks me to sign in all over again. A secondary issue is that app itself is a little clunky.",
      "This app stops working constantly! I'll come back in to finish a movie and it will be \"unavailable at this time\". 3/11 still not working properly, crashes a lot. I even try uninstalling the app and reinstalling it and then it tells me I have too many devices. I haven't added devices, I'm just trying to get the app to work. This is especially disappointing when you pay $70+ a year for an app to work and it doesn't."

      "Ads placed literally five seconds apart during the \"tutorials\", which consists of six different parts, about five minutes each. Made it to the second part, and the app insists on a viewer rating of five stars ( no choice ) before proceeding. Never watched a movie, as this seems fraudulent.",
      "Horrible app DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! I downloaded this thinking it would be a lot better then it is. All this app does is advertise for Hulu and Showtime apps. When you finally get to the \"movies\" all it is is a bunch of YouTube videos you can go and look at anytime by yourself with the YouTube channel. It is a complete waste of space, time and energy. Stay as far away from this app as possible!!!!",
      "Can't even get in the app because it just crashes and takes me out the second I try to get back in. Also, I just downloaded to see what a fake app this is because I'm assuming that you can't watch over 1000 movies for FREE. It's illegal to make an app with free movies anyway. 1 star do not download",
      "Awesome! Thank you so much for these services provided. So much less of a problem in comparison to some apps that don't respond as in perform in a sufficient and not so complicated manner. If you'd like to watch a movie, this app is for you, as it is for me.",
      "It keeps telling me that i need to reconnect to the internet. My internet is fine..i can use youtube and all that..the app itself is acting up. I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling..it doesn't work."
