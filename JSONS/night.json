      "Used to be fantastic. Now it has annoying ads that play before you can enable it. I'd be less annoyed if the ads played right after enabling it so I didn't have a bright video flash into my eyes unexpectedly. Got this to help with my migraines and now it tends to trigger them. Ads are fine - ya gotta make money. Do it smart though. If you're trying to get people to use your app because it helps reduce eye strain, forcing them to watch videos that strain your eyes isn't the smartest way to go.",
      "I've enjoyed this app for over a year, it's very comforting on the eyes and I like that there are multiple different screen filter options to chose from depending on what you want and each one can be set to your preferred dimness/brightness. I notice when I don't use it now, I get irritated looking at a screen without it. It looks funny at first, I first started by using at night because I wasn't used to it, but now I can't stand not having it on full time. It feels normal after a day or two.",
      "It works like it's supposed to :) . Sometimes when I have it on and I turn off my phone, the filter stops working even though it says it's still on. Nothing a \"quick click to stop and turn it on again\" can't fix. üòÅ Thankyou for this app! I just love how easy it is to use and how I can adjust the brightness etc.!",
      "Blue Light Filter is a perfect app I use every day to protect my eyes as there are many settings from which to choose, depending on the amount of light present and the amount of light one feels is necessary in order to comfortably view the screen, as a result. Other blue light shielding apps are not as easy or pleasant to use, and usually have a foolishly ovrrcomplicated UI. I've tried many other such apps, but have never found one to be nearly as useful and relatively bug-free.",
      "It does work really well, however if I'm still using my phone after a few mins it just turns off the blue light. I have to open the app for it to work again which is a bit tedious... I also can't select it in that multiple page thingy on my phone. It doesnt exist. Going to look at using a different app now since it doesn't seem to work well for me. I have the honor play phone, in case u want to fix it."

      "Much better than the blue light filters that come on my Android. I can make the screen so dark I can barely see it in a pitch black room. I don't put it quite that dark, but it shows the capability of this app. Update March 14th 2020. Something changed with the app. It's harder to pause or turn on the dark screen from your Android drop-down menu. You have to stop what you're doing and open the app to pause it or turn it on. I don't know why they changed this, it was perfect before. Frustrating",
      "Does not play well with other apps or Google. Closes other apps and Google frequently. Its only started happening since I installed this app. The app works great and I love the filter intensity and ease of use but it upsets my phone in too many ways and so i am not going to spend money on the full version until it is more stable on Android. Sorry developers. Please look into this issue we can enjoy your work and keep our eyes healthy. Ta!",
      "Classic app, really helpful to the eye. However, is there a way you can allow this app to run in the lock screen as it disables after you lock or open. Also is there a chance to make the app dim the notification/bar. Very good with black theme but can be uneasy with white colour schemes. Either way this app would be a 5 star if the notification and the lock screen has dim effect. Edit #1: Yes I have updated this app and I'm pleased to say that you guys fixed the problem as I've said. Thanks",
      "Unfortunately I have to give this a 2 for now. The reason is because if does t stay on despite the schedule time frame to be active. I've given it permission to override all other apps. I've been through all the settings to make sure I didn't miss something. But still it turns itself off. And even stranger, sometimes it turns itself back on after a few minutes. Whatever this glitch is needs to be fixed.",
      "Maybe someone can help with a problem I got. I tried the app, and then wanted to delete it, but after deleting the screen stayed yellow tainted. So at the moment I don't have the app but the screen is still yellow... Tried different phone settings, the issue prevails. Has anyone experienced it? On the other hand it does its job.. Maybe too well."

I use it every single night with no issues, super useful app, keep up the good work!",
      "Norton doesn't trust it. Why would an app like this need to collect information if you've never had to input any information? Screen logger? My wells fargo account got hit for like $25 the other day while I was asleep. This was the only suspicious app that norton alerted me of. Idk who hacked my account but don't trust these apps yall.",
      "Does the job very well and never glitches or interferes, something very rare in this kind of utility app. I paid not because it's obtrusive in any way, but because I'm so pleased with how well it works that I wanted to reward the developer for doing such a good job!",
      "At first, I couldn't believe that there is any app that can still lower the least brightness of a phone.ü§≠ It make my sight cool and normal than the lowest brightness of the phone...",
      "Its a super annoying app to use, sure it does ita job most of the time but recently its been turns itself off every 5 seconds and gotta open the app again to turn it back on, and ive experienced this issue with more than one phone. Frankly, if this issue is fixed it would be a way better app."

      "Simply Amazing, it gives sufficient amount of gameplay for a free game. With expansion pack available for money, which makes sense as there aren't any forced ads. The story is beautiful and the types of cards are in hundreds. I never use money for a mobile game but this game makes me think otherwise though the expansion pack is a little expensive ( rightly so)",
      "One of my favorite mobile games ever. It's one of the few I find myself able to play for hours at a time or in short sessions. So fun. Great mechanics, visuals, story, sound. Just so well put together. I definitely got my money's worth out of the extra in app purchases. Dont let them scare you off. The basics are great too!",
      "Its so refreshing to see a well made game that focuses on being a good game instead of milking the player of money. The roguelike card-system is well made and if there is criticiam to be had, its that the game is not that long and needs a bit more bosses and other content. That being said its not light obn content by any means and well worth the price.",
      "Good game. Get on their FB page Some cards have grammar errors making them unclear. Only 3 chapters r free. I bought the other characters, and they are good. Read all cards& enemy effects when playing. You can be 2hurt to proceed w/only fights left; fix that! I cant get past cursed werewolf. The Blessing to copy cards is broken, it never worked--please fix it. Modest chest doesn't mean what devs think it does.",
      "A brilliant, well-thought, and organized masterpiece! Most fun and addicting game I've played in a while. I see it as a mix of board game and card game in which you can see the effects. If ever you're tired playing the usual mmo, gacha, and cash grab mobages. This is definitely a must try."

      "I think the app is perfect at what it does, and I have no issues getting it to work. There's a lot of settings to choose from, like warm and cool filters to scheduling specific times for it. One thing however, and I know this is different for other devices, but because my device (Galaxy s9) is only allowed to have the screen dimmed and not the status bar or the notification panel, is there any word on making the notification dark/black? It would really help for devices such as mine",
      "perfect app. I downloaded a few to compare. This one was the best. I can't stand the bright blue light. This app allows me to pick the tone and the brightness. I personally like my brightness down super. It has the ability to get so dark, don't forget to turn the app off before walking outside in the sun! I learned that the hard way as I tapped around on my screen trying to find the pp and the stop button!",
      "Best I've found, and I've tried a LOT! It isn't intrusive, it's easy to turn off and on, there are no ads, it doesn't randomly turn itself off and blind you in the middle of the night, it doesn't constantly ask you to rate it, and it has a lot of flexible features. It makes me want to upgrade just to pay them for the great service I've got out of the free version.",
      "I just updated it yesterday.. now my widget for it doesn't work!!! Fix this!!!!...... Ok, I just re-downloaded it after a week & got the widgets to work! I guess maybe the update didn't update the old widget I had on my screen! This is my one & only dimmer I like.. I tried with others nope! I love the widget option because I don't have to go into the app itself to turn it on/off/greater/less... Which makes it really easy to work with! üòâü¶âüí°üî¶",
      "From simple to more advanced, this app has the settings to dim your screen. And colour adjustment, too. Auto start and stop included in the free version! And there's a widget available for the quick settings! Perhaps I just couldn't find it but for the auto stop in the manual timer, it would be nice for it to slowly brighten over 10 seconds (user defined please) rather than suddenly."

      "Update: My viewing issues don't involve wireless disconnect or interference. The app works for viewing every video recorded EXCEPT the most recent recording per camera. I have no idea why it won't play the most recent capture. But I have been able to verify this by attempting to play the video, failing, then walking in front of the camera to create a new video, then I can watch the previously unviewable video (although not being able to load/view/download the one I just made)",
      "I mainly bought this because it has an app and I can check on things when I'm not home. But the app is horrible. I've been through all the troubleshooting, more than once and nothing. It freezes all the time, have to restart my phone several times just to get it work, I get a motion detection notification and it won't take me to it to show me. I paid a lot of money for this and I'm disabled and can't work, so this is a huge investment for me. I hope this gets fixed really soon.",
      "At times it can be a pain. It keep losing connection with the wifi and I had to use so many email addresses until, I needed to make 2 new email addresses. I can not go back and look at any of the recordings. They need to improve on these problems. I want to add more, but the one I have, is a lot of work to keep it going. Then it freez up every now and again. But I do like it. I'll see if I can find something better, but if I can't, I will try these again. Improve your items.",
      "If I could give negative stars I would. I cannot play back events via the app on either my Android or iPhone on good wifi networks. After 5 attempts to reach someone on live chat support I was told it would be escalated to level 2 support. Never heard from anyone. Contacted support again and told the same thing. No one ever contacted me. Still have the issue and sent 2 more emails. Still no response. I travel for work which is the sole purpose of purchasing this system and it's useless.",
      "I have a DVR 1080P WD Wired Security System with 10 cams. The app is a poor design. You can't control video play back. You have to play from start to end no jumping to middle of video. so if your continuous recording good luck. Poor interface for pulling up calendar of recorded video. Unable to remotely configure DVR. No remote control of PTZ cams. Tech support unwilling to say what features are being developed/improved for the app and when releases are scheduled. I'm disappointed with app."

      "For those of you who complain about this not working in pitch black, you are ludacris. Of course it doesn't. Real night vision goggles cast infared waves onto objects and then they bounce back in to the sensor to create images of your surroundings. Your phone is built to detect infared waves, but not cast them. I think this app amplifies light sources to create brighter images. Also, (as it states in the description) the thermal filter is just an effect. Don't be so quick to judge.",

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app 2 times since yesterday. I usually really love this game, but I couldn't play it last night with a big group.",
      "The app shows under the navigation buttons. This makes it hard to hit the game buttons at the bottom of the screen. OnePlus 7t This can't be that hard. I created a Christmas version of the game with elves as the village and a Grinchs as the wolves using just Tasker and my voice recordings. Then I printed clipart of different elves at the local photo center, to use as the cards.",
      "Have loved this app but a recent update has cause the play button to be unreachable. The developer has said that this is due to the oxygen OS used on OnePlus phones but that isn't an answer to a problem affecting their user base. Surely moving the buttons for all would be an effective solution...",
      "I'd say this is an essential addition to the board game, especially so a player doesn't have to sit out just to moderate. Also, good level of customisability for what it is.",
      "On my OnePlus 6 the buttons for start, settings and timer are half cut off the bottom of the screen and stuck behind the Android buttons (back, home recents). I can use the app if I make the Android button hideable but it is awkward to do so each time plus it still looks odd with half buttons."

      "It's a good app, I used it when I had the Samsung Galaxy J7, and it worked perfectly. However, I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and now it doesn't work as well. It doesn't filter the pull down window (whatever you call it), and when you have the phone in rotation, the bar at the bottom with the home button, back, and tabs isnt filtered, so it just hurts your eyes unless you cover that portion of the screen with your hand or something. Can something be done about it?",
      "it's a great app but there is a flaw, when you are on the internet surfing and you run across the website that is asking for your location and they give you a choice to block or allow well, the only way you can touch the screen to get results by your choices is by turning off the filter to choose and make your choice because, there is something in the filter that prohibits the connection between finger and the screen when making those choices from other websites.",
      "Very glitchy. Definitely needs more work. I'm having a bunch of apps force close and pause whenever its being used. That's a shame because I really liked the app and the cute widget.",

Just like you, we do not like bugs! Where ever you may be, please stand and give these guys an ovation. The issue has been fixed. Remember to have your camera working as Halloween is right around the corner. Who will be watching your home when you are out hoarding candy? Secure. Protect. Connect.",

      "Good app but Please be careful. If you forget to close it, even if your phone screen locks, the data stream will continue. Got dinged for several GB several times. Even stopping background data for the app still allows steaming even when your screen locks. Now, I constantly force stop the app just to be sure. Edit : Mar 17 '19 Used it for 30 seconds, then closed it. 3 hours later received notification it used 5 gigs. Forced close the app, it continued background data. Not good.",
      "All i get is connect failed when trying to log onto the app after the update. So when is there going to be a new update because since the last update in 2018 i cannot view my cameras on the app. I have cleared the app cache and checked on the application permissions within the mobile device settings, ensured that all permissions are enabled. Also, contacted your support, which still was no help. Cameras still do not work. Seems like a waste a money when it was working just fine before the update.",
      "Live monitoring of video is generally ok, but...Video aspect ratios vary greatly in relation to the aspect ratio of the phone display. Need a user control to compensate for showing videos correctly on devices that are not a standard 16:9. Most newer phones are narrow but long, and the video gets stretched unnaturally. Also Push notifications don't seem to be working at all.",
      "Ive had these cameras for almost a year now systems great to have the app sucks. ive upgraded my Internet speeds. I reset my phone daily. I even have the system hardwired to my internet and reset the night owl device weekly. But almost everyday i cant connect do to the app. App has had no update in well over a year. And this is very frustrating. And before night owl says give us a call so we can help. I have Just need to make better app",
      "Updated my app, now I have to resell my whole camera setup, worked fine until update, now cannot get alerts. (The whole purpose of purchasing) Was going to purchase another nightowl 8 camera setup this week. Now I have to start the search for a decent surveillance company setup again. Not impressed, dont purchase this product, if you have sell it fast before others figure out it doesn't work anymore. Waste of money & your time"

      "It's an interesting app. But to call it Thermal Night Vision is misleading. That name implies it reads and colors images by heat. This is not at all true. The app reads and colors an image based on light. Looking at my 52\" TV show a 4\" space around the screen as hot. The center of the screen was cold. But the video I was watching was reduced in size and very dark. Same thing with an image of my grandson. One side of his face was lit up, but was from the light across the room.",
      "This app is unacceptable. It didn't concure with it's described very detailed description of All it's said tools and upgrades. It screams at me when I touch the buttons and it doesn't show night vision mode it just keeps screaming. Now I am haunted with this horriffic screams in the night mares I now have. Please look into this for a kid would suffer even more tradgic visions. I'm sure. Lucky I'm a gatherer and that means strong minded. But still can y'all please help me or give me a pass",
      "I need to use it more to give a more informed opinion. I like the ease of switching to thermal. It is a very clear image. Better than alot I have tried. I rated at 3 only because it was downloaded less than 10 minutes ago. I kept my experience down the middle due to this fact. I will welcome the opportunity to grade this application again after I familiarize my self to the abiliyies of performance, or any detriments thereof. Sincerely, Ms. Jolene Rae Fellows",
      "The only bad part is that it turns your flashlight on even though it says night vision other than that its a good app to screw around with.",
      "Night vision camera..... that does not work at night. It is pathetic. You have to use your torch for it to work and is just rubbish to use. 2 stars because it is REALLY fun to play with. That is my only positive comment. Other than that it is rubbish. Please don't get it because it just uses up your battery and doesn't work."

      "Awesome job . Best meditation app I've found and I've tried alot of them. I like being able to mix music and nature sounds. Keep up the good work. Thank you ps do you have other apps ?",
      "This app is very soothing and relaxing! Really calms me down and and sets me up for a better sleep! I Love the variety that has been added! This app is absolutely amazing!",
      "Its okay. Sometimes less is more though. By this I mean when I first imstalled this app it had maybe 6-8 sound effects that were not played on a short loop and were actually relaxing. But then all of a sudden there are over 40 new nature sounds which play on a 90 secomd loop(not all of them). I say strip it back to the essential sounds; rain in all its incarnations, rivers in all their forms, wind and fire, and birds in the forest. All in all, its worth the install.",
      "I was going 5 üåü but changed it to 4üåüdue to the ads (i know, i know but hey, it has to be perfect!üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) anyways it's a good app with many features and is user friendly (easy!) features: candle light, campfire , many nature sounds, you can add music and...there's an audio (a soft spoken voice/ female) that depending on what story you choose helps you to fall asleep by speaking & reading to you. Check it out!"

      "As someone who stuffers from horrible chronic migraines that are extremely light sensitive this app has been a life saver. Most apps that are blue light filters have pop up ads across and just aren't as useful. This app is also so aesthetically pleasing, which of course isn't necessary but very nice. You also have a lot more options than other apps like it. I've been using this app for 3 years now and I am so glad I randomly found it on the play store. It's really been a life changer, Thank you!",
      "This app will randomly turn itself off, drains the battery crazy fast, and the schedule 'feature' straight up doesn't work. The button in the notification bar doesn't work either, and will often freeze up my entire phone. Worthless app. One star is more than it deserves.",
      "The most useful apps for me because i cared my eye so much ... This app works well and so far theres no problem with this app and definetly recommended .",
      "The free version is great! It can be hard to see and turn it off in daylight, but it works really well at night. HOWEVER (devs pls note!) I wouldn't purchase premium. I usually leave it on the setting it has, so it's not a big deal if I can't change brightness or color from the notification page. Trying to is quite annoying. The notification buttons aren't very responsive, and they use increments of 1. Please increase to at least 5, or bring up sliding bars with the color options when tapped.",
      "Very cool app, blue light filter with several different colors. Would recommend to anyone, save your eyes."

However, as much as i love it, that annoying ad is ruining the game, \"Miner To Rich - Idle Tycoon Simulator.\" It is not playing, it didn't provide the reason why i watch the ad, after i play it, i can't play any other ad anymore, and lastly, I CAN'T REPORT THIS AD. Will you please fix this ad as soon as possible. Thank you.",
      "Dear developer, 1. Please change or remove the sound of the car horn, its getting annoying after playing a while. 2. Please add an option to remove the speech bubble, its doesnt have any function other than disrupt the gameplay. 3. Please change the number from the income and the price of the upgrade. Its confusing.",
      "It's cute and addicting. However, I always get stuck at a certain action due to ads, which most of the time, doesn't work at all . For example, theres a certain character visiting you and either choices doesn't work so you have to exit the app for it to disappear. There's also a requirement on some furniture and receipts that you have to watch at least one ad to unlock, but then again, ads don't pop up no matter how hard you try. The game's a pretty good time killer tho. Kudos to that!",
      "Good game but too many bugs like when trying to watch ads but it isn't working, whenever i try to click watch ads or watch tv it doesn't work unless you exit the game and relogin again. After watching one ad or two ads bug comes up again and watching ads stops working over and over again. Please fix that bug asap. Overall it's a cute and relaxing game that everyone might love except if you won't fix those bugs we might actually stop playing it.",
      "It's a cute and addictive game, I enjoy the visuals and the soothing background music. It has a fairly easy gameplay and not time consuming for an idle game. My only problem is that everytime I press on Santa or try to collect a lot of money on the table, my screen would be all glitchy and would swipe to either side of the page by itself. Could you please fix this problem so that it wouldn't be so sensitive and move to the other screen by itself? Once you do I would edit my experience, thanks!"

      "This is a really useful app, I use it every night. I just wish that the settings you can use to change the colour of the 'text' actually changed the colour of the text of the clock and date display. Instead it only changes the colour of the pop up control icons which appear at the side when you tap the screen and which then disappear after use and leave white clock digits. It would merit 5 stars if that bit worked as you would expect.",
      "I have used this for a while. I did use another of these programs but it got bloated and became cumbersome to use. This one works straight away. Simple to set alarms. Why take an alarm clock when you can have this. It automatically starts up when you plug in the charger. I recommend this.",
      "Love the clock, it has tons of settings. Only thing I can't seem to find is a way to make it bigger because it really only occupies like 1/2 of my screen size",
      "It does everything is says in the paid Full version. So far other then a few crashes with my Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S everything is working fine. My favorite is the Digital Clock with date/weather. I also like that I can stream music at night with a timer. Puts me to sleep!",

Another app on Goople Play Store has an identical screen layout so probably a copy or duplicate BUT it did have a better visual capability HOWEVER it used the selfie lens which I thought is pointless and poor engineering and no apparent option to switch.

      "Great. My kids love it. It's our official bedtime story every night. It changed bedtime from a time of terror to fun.",
      "Enjoyed by young grandchild many times.",
      "Great little app lets toddlers interact with farm animals and learn sequence and cause and effect- each animal does something different when tapped once, twice or thrice. The lights are on in the animal's home until your toddler turns off the light and the animal goes to sleep. Soothing Grandpa-voiced narrator says goodnight to the animals and to the child who is still awake after all the animals are asleep. Extra animals are worth buying for a low price. Preferred to passive watching of videos",
      "Amazingly relaxing even for me! I look forward to bedtime no so we can turn off the lights in the farm lol. My kids adore this little app and immediately go to bed after turning off all the lights and the aninals start snoozing. Love the designs as well they are very well drawn and they have this warmth to them. I bought the extra package of animals for like 2 dollars! Love this so much an easy 5 stars from me and my kids ‚ù§",
      "In the past I downloaded this app on another phone, with the extra animals. Now installed the app again on my new phone, but unfortunately I can't install the extra 6 animals. I tap on the button, give the right answer, tap the ‚Ç¨ 0,00 button, but it doesn't install. What went wrong?"

    "description":"Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?\r\nAre you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!\r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\r\n\r\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour. See references below..\r\n\r\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\nhttp://twilight.urbandroid.org/doc/\r\n\r\nGet more from Twilight\r\n1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading. Especially as it is able to lower the screen backlight far below the ability of the backligt controls on your screen\r\n\r\n2) AMOLED screens: We have tested Twilight on an AMOLED screen for 5 years without any sign of depletion or over-burning. If properly configured Twilight causes less light emission (by enabling dimming) with more equal light distribution (dark areas of the screen such as the status bar get tinted). This may in fact increase your AMOLED screen life time.\r\n\r\nBasics on circadian rhythm and the role of melatonin\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanopsin\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythms\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm_disorder\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n- location - to find out your current sunset/surise times\r\n- running apps - to stop Twilight in selected apps\r\n- write settings - to set back-light\r\n- network - access smartlight (Philips HUE) to shield you household light from blue\r\n\r\nAutomation (Tasker or other)\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/twilight4android/automation\r\n\r\nRelated scientific research\r\n\r\nAmplitude Reduction and Phase Shifts of Melatonin, Cortisol and Other Circadian Rhythms after a Gradual Advance of Sleep and Light Exposure in Humans Derk-Jan Dijk, & Co 2012\r\n\r\nExposure to Room Light before Bedtime Suppresses Melatonin Onset and Shortens Melatonin Duration in Humans Joshua J.

Especially as it is able to lower the screen backlight far below the ability of the backligt controls on your screen<br><br>2) AMOLED screens: We have tested Twilight on an AMOLED screen for 5 years without any sign of depletion or over-burning. If properly configured Twilight causes less light emission (by enabling dimming) with more equal light distribution (dark areas of the screen such as the status bar get tinted).

      "I think it is better for my sleep. I find that auto mode doesnt work very well but i think that is the phone.",
      "To help me fall asleep, I turn this on and do nonograms with soothing music until I can't stay awake. I'm glad my friend told me she used this. I've noticed the improvement in my sleep. The only thing that is an issue... Sometimes it just shuts off. Might be something running in the background tripping it up. I removed some apps and it doesn't happen much anymore.",
      "Unfortunately, this app works, but not using an optimal method. It does make things redder and remove blue light. However, it does this with a red overlay, causing black pixels to increase above (0,0,0) to have a red contribution. This means black pixels on an OLED screen start to use power, and also decreases the contrast of text if you are reading white text on a black background.",
      "This is really saving my eyes! The app is easy to use. It is easy to pause the screen overlay when needed, and to adjust the brigjtness. It stable and does not cause other apps to misbehave on my android os. I'm very happy with this app. Update 2020. Using app on 2 devices. No glitches or issues. Pause feature is nice."

      "Exactly what I needed. Had tried some others, it was going fine with another app that I was using previously, but it stopped working after an upgrade. Glad I found this one. It's programmable and adjustable. Kudos to the author(s). The only flaw is that it crashes sometimes, specially if I use the stop (turm off) button",
      "Not a bad app, but just like all other similar apps it keeps shutting off at random. I'll have the brightness turned down and be trying to read something late at night and then all of a sudden it goes back to its normal light and punches me in the eyeball.",
      "Makes it easy to dim out blue light when I use my Bible app at night",
      "Really helps at night to not have the bright light, my eyes don't bother me now.",
      "Pretty good so far, its a fully customizable light filter."

Uninstall the app, reinstall the app and it always works just fine as you browse thru settings, etc, but soon as you enter a dvr's settings and go to connect for live view, it force closes (crashes). soon as you try restarting the app, crash!",

I CANNOT playback any recordings from previous days or weeks on my tablet, which is VERY VERY annoying and makes the whole night owl unworthy to me. I need help resolving this issue",
      "I am trying to install the app on my new laptop, but it keeps telling me its already installed. So where is my live view then, why can't I see my cameras? So frustrated. Can see cameras from my smartphone and one laptop but not on this one for some reason. What am I doing wrong? HELLLLP!",

After spending so much money it's disappointing the App is not working properly with the cameras. I've also tried to download the video but it will not play after downloading. Pls update App asap, or create a new App to work with my Night Owl WNVR model."

But the alarm \"preview\" in the upper right corner never works. To get it to show my wake-up time, I have to turn my wake-up alarm off, then back on, and then reset the volume. So I had to install a different wake-up alarm app.",
      "Those who couldn't find the settings, you need to change your navigation style from full screen (where you swipe your finger upwards to perform navigation actions) to navigation buttons in your android's settings. Once done, you'd be able to see the settings option in the app with three dots right next to the navigation buttons.",
      "I have been using this app for years and it is the best. Problem is, when my GS9 updated to Android 10, the settings button on the navigation bar went away. It's useless without that. I've tried holding, the \"Back\" button and reinstalling. Some folks seem to still be using this fine. Can anyone help???",
      "I like this app but it doesn't work on my wife Samsung Galaxy S10. Even though she upgraded to the Donate version to get rid of the light bar it only shows the hours and not the minutes! Come on and remove the bugs!",
      "Look OK on Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Easy access to apps settings for alarm, font, color etc but does not support use of Android alarms so have to go with app own built in alarms settings. Unable to move to SD card."

      "Unfortunately only allows one to combine five sounds to play at once but otherwise very good. Nice settings available and the sounds used are lovely. I especially like the forest sounds.",
      "I'm glad i got this instead of a white noise machine. This is the best relaxing noise app I've tried. Our baby is 5 months old and we just play it off of our phones or tablets over a small $5 bluetooth speaker. We all sleep well even througn a power outage. All of the sounds are realistic and looped well. It's lovely to look at and easy to adjust. Thank you for this wonderful app. Almost too relaxing. I got the full version quick!y because i was impressed with the app very quickly. Well worth it",
      "Love that I can combine sounds at different volumes. Also love that I can set a timer. (I use it this way: I usually set it to turn off about a half an hour before my alarm goes off, so that if I wake up, I automatically know if it's ok to turn over and go back to sleep, because it's at least more than a half hour until my alarm goes off. This really helps me not interrupt my sleep because I don't have to look at any lights or anything.) Really clean interface, and ads are not in the way.",
      "Was great at first but then the sounds kept having little breaks in them, which were very distracting. Probably not intended, but bothersome nonetheless.",
      "Really love this app. Being able to pick and choose sounds to layer with their own volume is great. I just have two requests: can you make the frequency of repeated sounds, like the owl, etc adjustable as they're so frequent it's annoying. Also I paid for the premium version thinking I would get more sounds and features, but it just removes the ads, and I guess offline use. Nice, but if I pay more I want to get more. But nice work on this! Thanks"

I had it downloaded for about 2min before uninstalling it. The adds at the bottom of the screen stay bright even when you dim the night light part, negating the whole point of dimming. Also, I had the sounds turned off for a reason, but tapping on anything brings up adds that run with sound. The adds make this app pretty much completely useless.",
      "Ads pop up as soon as I open it... Bummers.. then they don't even label each song so I had to press and wait for them to download just to hear what they were... N the night light isn't that exciting. I'll just stick with my relax melodies app and a night light instead."

      "It is a very good app and works as intended, but not everything is covered by it. It doesn't cover the tool bar at the top were the battery and time is. And when you swipe down it doesn't seem to cover that screen either. It would be nice if it covered everything no matter what, then I would probably give it a 5 star rating. But other than that I really like the app and will recommend it to others. As I have seen other people mention as well it could use a schedule timer.",

      "I dont know whats worse? Customer support that blames everyone else about why the app isn't working, or the numerous trouble confirmation emails after a hour or 2 on the phone explaining they were working fine up until beginning of december, now only local wifi works. No corrections no more follow ups and no away from home viewing. I was thinking maybe the equipment is to old and buy a newer one from them, well no it hasn't been maybe 4-5 years and it works good at the house, with comcast cable wifi modem.. besides that who wants to deal with this kinda service.... All port forwards done and dvr online and identifies as having a connection the the internet. but these people don't care or would have someone working the phones in tech support that knew what was going on. even had comcast call them on a 3 way conversation and explain to them there are no blocks and everything looks good on their end. result 2 weeks ago sent another trouble confirmation number through email. That makes at least 4 now, but no result. decided to upgrade to a poe system from another company. It was 1k but they have been around for a long time and not a fly by night company",
      "Unable to view Cameras from Mobil application anymore. Have owned and used this system for 5years. I've spent a lot of money with installation of camera's. Not to mention moving twice and having to pay for reinstalling camera's. The main reason I chose this system is to be able to check my home periodically through out my day. Know I'm told the server no longer supports this system! What the heck does that mean. Just because it's Five years old, I should throw it away? That's horrible!",
      "You can view current, live time and back up to view any footage previously recorded.",
      "Does not work. I hit SCAN on the device add page to scan the code on my DVR, and the app restarts every time. Total waste. I'm considering returning the entire security system as is.",
      "Luckily I didn't pay for these cameras, they came with our house. Most of the time I can't view them, I'm always having to unplug then plug them back in. Gonna change them out for the Wyze cams that are much cheaper and more reliable!"

      "I really like it. I don't think it connects to 'Lily's Day Off' though.. possibly because the true endings were completely different. This one is trying to save the world from destruction by finding a way to communicate with Lily while the other game, (Lily's Day Off) is where Lily and the player is trying to make a new start. I like games like these and whoever made these games- well, I like your \"strange sence of humor.\" I think that's what Vicky said in this one.. Anyhow, thanks for the game!",
      "This game has to be possibly one of the best out there. Though short and having a wonky story sometimes, it never proves to be anything but enjoyable, and the same can be said about this games precursor, Lily's day off. In this one you get more than a singular character, Vicky, Nym, and Lily being a tad bit more fresh than just lily herself, even if they could be a bit more. . . deepened in character? All in all, it was a wonderful game, and I hope i'll see more advetures, keep up the good work!",
      "This game is such a unique experience! With all the twists and mind blowing ending, I can't imagine how long this took I have to thank the developer for releasing this, it was so fun and it kept me busy when I was bored! The music is wonderful and the art is so good!! It's so different from Lily's day off and dare I say betterüòÇ thank you again I just felt the need to share my thoughts on thisüòÖ",
      "It's a great leap from the day off game. It has good music ,with great variety in art styles and story outcomes. It was great up to the point where your character says Lily's night off. Then that star shaped (supposedly final) ending had to come along. Hope to see another of Lily's time off!",
      "I was thrown off by the fact of no saving. Though, as the endings go, it is all FANTASTIC. Lily and you can become completely different characters, from a psycopath to a crazy to just affectionate. Every misc. ending is executed perfectly. The 3 love endings are all great. The true ending is Fantastic. The Secret True ending is by far the best. It was actually sad as you see how the characters have evolved and the fact you need every ending, showing how much character they have. Just Superb."

      "SO EASY and CONVENIENT. LOVE the quick, easy access to control wide range of brightness with 1 tap/swipe! Some other apps are too bright or too dim. Whole screen lights up instead of partial like some other apps. Simple to use. Date, time, and battery level on screen, so you don't have to exit out. STAYS ON until you turn it off. No ads. BEST nightlight app I've downloaded üëç Thank you üòä",
      "Thanks for taking my suggestion! You should also add a top margin so that the brightness slider and the About icon (the question mark) don't get cut off by a hole punch or a notch. Also, the About icon should hide along with the rest of the controls instead of being persistent like the clock, date and battery level.",
      "It's great to have a desk clock like this. I like that it doesn't stay in one spot long so the screen doesn't get burnt.",
      "Nice, could also have settings with screen-on time options: Always (not turn off screen), 15min, 30, 1hour, 2hr, 3hr, 6hr, 8hr, 10hr, 12hr",

      "Great app with some exceptions: no diacritics support in subtitles, manual loading of subtitles although they are in the same folder as the movie and with the same file name (different extension, obviously). 2 brightness controls and 2 volume controls. Why? Just use the Android ones. No background on subtitles. I only listed the problems. But the app is REALLY good except for these.",
      "Offers the features that make it unique, but no others. Can't free-form zoom; can't even change the zoom from within the player, you have to go into the app's settings each time. Swipe-scrubbing, a feature cloned from VLC and MX Player, is cloned terribly. A slight swipe will sent you back or forward by minutes, not seconds. Overall this is a work in progress, but not movie watching material as of yet.",
      "Thank you for delivering this app. There's no developer that thought of these features when watching content. Keep improving dynamic compression of the audio. I noticed on the compressor seems like it's making the audio go in and out or dropping out the background instead of a smoother leveling. I'll give this a good rating because its the only app with emphasis on these features.",
      "Epic sound improvement on audio files and videos. Thanks love it.",
      "I've installed this app on on Android TV, but I'm not able to add any videos to it. It should automatically read all the video files from the external storage but it's not. Could you tell me how to manually add the files. I use a seagate external hardisk. I mostly watch shows and movies from it which are mostly in mp4, avi, flv formats. The other players that i use automatically read the files from the hard disk and add it to the library."

      "AWESOME APP! This app is amazing. You can touch an object, star, planet, satellite and an info button will appear at the bottom. Touch that and it tells you all about the item with additional photos etc. The background music just takes you away while you explore the cosmos from the comfort of your chair.

Mobile images appear to have more noise, they are usually blurry and lack detail in shadows. Bright areas turn into pure-white spots. Faces seem unnaturally flat, especially when using a flash.

The 8-10 burst flashes of night shots result in a messy image each time of nothing usable. I don't see the point of keeping the app.",
