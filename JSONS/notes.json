      "This app has potential, but even though I just started using it, I can see where it needs work, 1. Voice recognition is very spotty. No matter how many times I carefully said \"get lemons\" or \"buy lemons,\" the text results were a joke. So I went to PushBullet and entered my grocery list manually. 2. Every time I created a message, the app produced both a text result (distorted, see above) and an audio recording. I did not want the recordings taking up storage space and spent time deleting every one. Best to give users a choice Text? Voice? Both? before speaking.",
      "I really enjoy using this application but I do wish it had a few more functions such as being able to highlt text in a range of colours. Being able to paste images in different notes. Having a ruler function as well as a pen. So far it's a really great little app but I think these extra things can be added to make it even better :)",
      "1. There should be an option of attaching pdf in the notes that we make. 2. App doesn't work efficiently in landscape mode. (No issues in Portrait mode) 3. There should be an option of using bullets, Italic font, other font types etc (Like in MS office word) 4. Apart from above, there are no issues with this app. Best to use ! Hoping for above mentioned changes in upcoming updates ☺️",
      "I absolutely love this app. Finally a proper notepad for reminders, notes, fast notes handwritten, the notes itself can handle longer text (for fax draft), I can include pictures or web links, and it's connected with my google account so I do everything only one time but it's automatically there on my tablet too. I was looking for something like that for years. I have on my mobile almost only Google apps because they all work great together and perfect between mobile and tablet and it works",
      "Why is there a limit on labels? We really need 'Get Info' in the context menu to view 'Date Created' and/or 'Date Modified'. Let's take it to the next level by associating collaborators with labels, so much easier than adding a contacts in bulk per note. We would benefit from being able to copy the link of the note to share with other services. Also, if possible, could you attempt to add a find/replace feature within a note? Could we have the capability to attach items of various file types?"

      "This app is honestly very solid and reliable. If there is one quirk I have, it's that the app's UI seems a little dated. I know it's the big thing to make a modern UI aesthetic, but it's something I think ColorNote would benefit from. ColorNote has a great amount of depth and functionality despite it being a note taking app first and foremost. I think that whoever programmed this app did a great job with it. This app has been a staple on all my Android phones and it syncs your notes as well!",
      "I have used this app in the past but then I switched to Google Keep. But lately I have been getting very frustrated with Google keep and this feels like a breath of fresh air. I hope I stick with this app this time. One suggestion I have is that it would be helpful if there were a way to add widgets to my home screen directly inside the app (rather than leaving the app and pressing the home screen where I actually want to place the widget). Not sure if Android would allow this future.",
      "I estimate that I have used this app since about 2013. I use it daily to jot down things that pop in to my head, to make checklists, to write down information while on the phone instead of using scratch paper which used to get lost, and to write poetry or prose and save it for later. No ads and no links or etc. I love that it is very, VERY simple. It is exactly like getting a piece of paper and then just typing on it and that is all. Saves lists indefinitely and can be backed up.",
      "Very cool. Love it. I don't trust my memory that much, so just drop notes in about anything I want to keep a record of or remember or if I just want to note something down. There is no faffing around, real simple which is what I want for quick note taking and no disruptions. Perfect. Thanks for making it.",
      "I've been using this app for as long as I can remember. Many phones have come and gone, but this app has been with me the whole time. From my phone to my tablet, and PC I've never lost a note. The backup function is especially useful and I've kept a long history of notes. I totally recommend it I don't know what I'd do without it!!"

      "So, it's black. Most of the times. Except when we turn to landscape and it turns into white blackground. Although we can save/retrieve (\"backup/restore\"?) to web storage, we can't access it from different devices; need to take fast notes on some ideas to a later further development on the tablet? Forget, you can't. I payed for no-ads because when it started to show ads it doesn't seem to work anymore. The bottom line: it could be a very nice app. It could.",
      "Possibly one of the best note apps out there. It gives flexibility in writing, simple to use (’cause it's notes duh), and an aesthetically pleasing presentation and background. Highly recommend. Been using for a while, really liking it, no MAJOR issues encountered *thus far*.",
      "Perfect white type letters and black background , otherwise I feel like I'm staring at a flashlight , I never have glitches or problems with black note , it's user friendly and quick and I really like I can set type letters from small to larger size , I highly recommend this app black note",
      "Way better on the eyes with that dark screen. I enjoyed it thoroughly you can put your shopping list or you can just quit know if you're watching something on TV and you need the information just type it on in your little blacked note and look at it later. Thanks little blacknote great so far",
      "It has no flaws, nothing to complain about. But I feel that the only 'pop' thing about this app is that it's set in a black colour. If you want me to get more apps of yours then spice it up a bit and give me a reason to live it :)"

      "I love this app. But as many noticed with the last update (early March 2020), all my old notes showed on the main screen but were blank when I tried to open each one. I updated all my apps hoping it was the problem. Didnt work. So I went into this app specifically and updated it alone. Now its back to normal and I can open up all my old notes!",
      "I use this for alot of things, including my shopping list. As you delete items from your list and try to bring the next item back, it doesn't, so you have a huge gap between rows and/or items. Whatever I had on my Samsung Galaxy 6 was better!!! It allowed you to back space/delete everything while holding down on the backspace or \"x\" key. The app on the Galacy 8 doesn't. You can only delete one row at a time, like I stated above.",
      "The March 2020 update clearly was quirky and you couldn't open the notes. I have been using this app for years and transferred notes between phones when I've upgraded and this has never happened. It really scared me to think all the data I've lost. But I followed the advice of another user below - update the app separately and I now everything is full restored and I have access to all of my notes. It would have been helpful if Samsung provided this info versus trial an error by the users.",
      "A great app , however badly managed ESPECIALLY directly after a system upgrade. Opened app for info required and no data available. Warning appeared showing ' app crash ' - ongoing until I accessed app on Google Play Store and updated ( system update just done ??? ). A critical app and more focus required from Samsung/Developer.",
      "I had a ton of notes on here...and was pleased with it. Then one day I tried to open my notes and all i would get was a blank page. I tried rebooting my phone and checking settings. Finally I hit edit on each note before opening, shared it to my email and emailed to myself. I am now deleting it and going with something else. With all these negative reviews you would think they would do something to fix it."

      "Looks like Microsoft doesn't have time to look after the bugs. Very bad experience of this app. It hangs quotes often asking there are many features requested by users worldwide and looks like Microsoft is very busy. Moving to Notion today. At least Microsoft should have done features which makes migration easy. It's like, once you are addicted to their product, you can not escape.",
      "It works well. But of course I have had on hiccup when using it over the past year and that was easily fixed by just reinstalling the app. Its great for those who like sharing content between their different devices, and has potential to also be a learning tool for schools (like a cloud based classroom where material can be put up and then answers uploaded into folders by the student).",
      "The app itself is good, but it is no-where close to the desktop version. That version is more feature-packed, more customizable, and just overall a better experience than this app. Microsoft, if you see this review, please update this app. I really would like to use OneNote as my primary way of taking college notes. Also, please stop showing the \"recent pages\" page when I start the all. I prefer going directly to my most recent notebook compared to the actual recents page.",
      "I've been using it for long now. Lately it began to be a pain in the... Eny time I switch apps and come back to OneNote, it is stuck fozen and you have to kill the process and the restart OneNote again to paste something or type something. But then you switch to other app again (for instance, reading some book), find a spot you need to keep, copy piece from there, come to OneNote - it's stuck frozen again, you have to kil and restart the app... What's a heck!? Microsoft, this one used to work! Revert to the working version and stop destroying the app calling it \"improvement\"! I realy start to wonder if I should stop my Office subscription!",
      "I like it cause this is the most practical handwriting note inter-devices and can be access through all medium, web and phone. My only problem is the shifting. I'm using a Samsung Tablet and every time I handwrite there will be a slight left shift of the words which is very frustrating especially when I want to write using Chinese characters which means stroke order is very important and a shift will ruin the stroke order. I also wish there is a way to turn off the pressure sensitivity for S Pen"

I have used this app for two months, there are several issues with this app. 1) It claims to support text formatting but it never works. 2) if screen goes off midway in the note writing you'll all typed note. 3) backups are not Encrypted, they are stored in plain text format. Hey, come on this is 21st century and this app is for 18th century people.",

This app does a better job at syncing and formatting than Color Notes. The Dropbox sync is nice, but if the developer added pCloud, that would be even better (which is why I rated 4 out of 5 stars).",

When ever I put a check in the \"Encryption\" Check Box and type in a Encryption Password, I get a message saying: \"Notes has stopped.\" ... and then I close it and reopen it, and proceeding same procedure, and get a message saying, \"Unfortunately, Notes has stopped.\", and I can't do I encryption Password, because of that!

      "It's okay for what I need it for, which is just quickly jotting down notes so I don't forget them. But if you're looking for something easy to use that's non-buggy or for longer projects I don't recommend this one.",
      "Terrible experience with thos app, if you write a lengthy title the date covers it up, if you scroll it has the chance to highlight some of your notes then the keyboard comes up and if you tap a letter on accident theres no undo button so if you forgot to bad.",
      "Agree with many other users. This was a lovely, simple little app before the decision to put intrusive banner ads at the top of frame. This is now taking up far too much screen space, in a terrible choice of area and impacting the clean simplicity that i previously liked. Totally get that free apps often need ads but more thought should be put into how this is implemented. This choice smacks of favouring the advertiser's needs over the user experience. This is why I've uninstalled.",
      "It's all good apart from recently everytime I open the app I have to wait to use it as it opens a separate window for some YouTube ad. It's so annoying. I understand a free app has to have ads but this is such an annoyance as it stops me from quickly writing a note, takes me to another page and I have to close it and return to write. Think I'm going to transfer my notes to another app.",
      "Don't get this app, reasons: 1. If connected to the internet, you will be taken to a pop up spam as that offers you some kind of prize but is bs. 2. The app often crashes on me when I'm Tryna type, being because an ad would pop up and make me click on the link by accident and screw up my writing. 3. A few times I've gone into my notes to read of them and they are just gone, nowhere to be seen, this happened mainly on unnamed notes."

      "easy to keep check lists, notes, add and delete items, change font size/color. I use it for my grocery list and delete items as they go in my cart. easy to see what I still need. EDIT: They've stated putting ads on the screen when you exit the app. When I could just tap the X to close it, that was OK. But now the ads are for games that can't be closed for at least 5 seconds. Really annoying!",
      "I used to use this app every day-- it was my store everything app. But now it plays an ad when I sign in & when I'm changing from one note to another! That makes it almost worthless. When I need to make & access notes, I need to do so immediately. 15 second delays to watch ads is preposterous. I'm not playing a game, I'm working & managing my life.",
      "UPDATE: This was good, until noisy ads that I can't mute. I'm used to jotting notes anywhere and everywhere, but now it's very embarrassing to be on the app and suddenly I get a very loud advertisement blaring from my phone, with no quick way to mute only the ads. (I wouldn't mind the ads as much, if they were quiet and could be muted immediately). OLD REVIEW: Quick and convenient. Not sure how or why, but at some point this just became my simple little go to app for notes.",
      "I've been using this app for a long time and it's been reliable for me. The backup function is great for when you inevitable switch phones. BUT, a recent update forces video ads to play that can't be closed out when you save a note. This is hugely intrusive. I will be looking for a new note taking app and no longer reccomend this one.",
      "Good app, but the commecial in the midst of my notes is a little unsettling. My highlights cannot be seen on the general page as a highlighted text, thats not satisfying to me. I have not found a way to forward my notes to my email. I am new to the app and still working on how best to use it. I wish l can highlight some notes but cant see how to do it!"

      "Edit: Hi, its sad to write this but the app is making me frustrated. The app crash several times when I am typing like I type something and it will stop in middle, nothing works and then I have to just close it and open again. There is also the audio issue, where when I delete an audio inside a note and then open it again, the audio will be still there no matter how many times I delete it, so to delete one I have to delete the whole note. Also no way to undo the Quote if u accidentally click it.",
      "Sync problems, previously flagged with the team, never resolved. The function just doesn't work. Was willing to put up with it since I mostly stick to my phone for notes, but having just lost my notes, I am going to uninstall. Cannot recommend. (after sync being stuck for ages, I decided to uninstall and reinstall the app to see if that would help syncing. It was not clear that notes which had been on my phone for ages, supposedly syncing, would also be lost!)",
      "The app has now started to suck. Whenever I try to open images it crashes. Some content gets deleted automatically. Text will be visible on the windows application but not on Android application even after syncing. Please repair the bugs, I rely on this app too much. I'll update my review if the bugs are removed.",
      "It's very simple making notes app. Sometimes it doesn't work better like before. For note making, the simplest way is to use your note book but sometimes we need a note making app in our phone when we out . But No need of this. Because this is very simple making note app. It will never make you attractive to read your notes. The best suitable ratings for this app should be 1.5 star. Because it deserves it. And if you want a note making app so download some other app, never this app.",
      "This is the best note taking app on the play store for me. I can have as many notebooks as I want and as many notes as I need in those notebooks. The notes are not limited to one type. I can have a checklist, writing and, a picture all in one note which is hard to find in other apps. What would make this app five stars for me is being able to use pictures from my phone as notebook covers and different colored highlighters."

      "Colorful, easy organization! ADHD Helpful. I tried many list, to do and note apps. This easily won.I love that I can change the font style and size due to vision issues. It makes me happy to see all notes instead of overwhelmed by it all. Tackling organization is fun. I make a different colored note for each section of a room or job and what's in the section and then have a great view of what needs to be done. Inventory is fun. It's cheerful, not tedious to manage many parts of life. New fav!!",
      "I love how i have choices on how i want to see my note, sticky note, or notepad. It also has a \"to do\" list. That makes it easy for me to remember the days events!! The app gets 5 stars all the way!!! Greg",
      "Way better than the Google keep notes I had on my phone before which kept shutting down on me. It also replaced the event or reminder feature on calendar I was using. I love the variety of different styles like the brightly colored sticky notes and the notepad. Very cool I'm glad I switched!!!",
      "One of the cuter note apps, but not for what I need. I can't put sticky notes on my home screen which was my whole purpose for installing. My Samsung phone have that app but this LG doesn't have it. I'll have to keep looking.",
      "First time to EVER use anything like this... LOVE IT!!! **I am a Habitual, Lifelong Note-Taker and this app has made me so Happy, Un-Clutered my life and Eased my Stress Level IMMENSELY!! **Side note #2... I'm so NOT a Wiz at Anything \"Techy\", but this was SUPER EASY to not only Download and Install, but to Operate and Use, IMMEDIATELY!! No Fuss, No Clutter, Great Choices for Easy, Fast Use!! Thank you guys so much for actually proving to be Simpler than the \"About Info\"... 10+⭐'s"

      "Hello, I greatly love your app, which is better now than before. The new features you have added makes me to return once more. But I want you to include a *vault* in the app for strictly personal notes since I hate intrusion by someone who can just read all notes at a glance. Additionally, let the vault as other vaults have a lock for absolute privacy. You can include editing features to the app as well. I think other userl like me will give you 5-stars and will go premium. Thanks",
      "I LIKE 'My Notes' -- I can detail folders and also make appt reminder, groc lists, bills, ie folders. I cant pick colors for my folders names though. (I like not synch to Google-*BACKUP*!) ALSO, IN THE BEGINNING UNTIL THE LAST COUPLE OF UPDATES THE REMINDERS ALERTED ME TO THE ITEM ON MY LIST. NOW NO SOUND!! I'LL MIGHT JUST GET A NOTIFICATION IN TOP LEFT OR THAT MAY NOT EVEN HAPPEN AND REMEMBER I GOT SOMETHING GOING ON AND I'LL OPEN IT AND THE WHOLE EVENTS PASSED. --fix & my rating goes to 5*",
      "I just got Google Play Pass. I saw this on there free premium. Got it and I know right away this is what I have been looking for. I have Google Keep which is good but not what I am looking for. This app is easy layout and still syncs with Google Drive. And well more to choose. Thank You!...2/3/2020/ I Had this on my tablet before. But it was dying. So I had to get a new. And I was trying out new reminder/notes apps. Then I remembered this. And thought you dummy. You know this is the best. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "I am loving this note app. Has everything I need. Folders, reminders, sync. It's great with a pleasant interface. After using for 1 day though (full version), I notice the reminder portion is not great. It hardly reminds. I had hoped to replace the Samsung reminder app which, is a full screen reminder. Not a dealbreaker though.",
      "02/29/20, Text overlap issue resolved. I rely on this app: it's friendly, customizable, simple, organized, convenient, & doesn't use much space. Gets smoother with updates, swipe between notes, holds order of notes until you change it, limitless scrolling, star priority marking, schedule alarm reminders, and more! They really do work to fix problems. What if we could make 2-3 columns notes for comparisons?"

      "Pretty easy to use and fast simple and gets the job done but an other colour would be better maybe old paper type colour like a patina or something modern this yellow textbook kinda feel not anyone's favourite also ads are well managed but hope you find a way to have that removed yet still make some money keep it up",

      "Great. But, I'm new to evernote. But, addicted now 😍 Very excited having it. But, it need some updates. It's better to show following them on the task bar: Font color, change page color, font size, font style, comment option, insert table & etc. I love it soo much. But, expecting this like google docs",
      "Edit: seems to be fixed right now, except the formatting is still wrong. Lots of problems trying to sync when using it across different devices. I use the app on my phone and sometimes I'll try to log in on the website on my computer at work where I don't want to download the app. Whenever that happens all the formatting gets screwed up and it's so frustrating that I'm beginning to find it not worth using. There's better ways to store my information.",
      "As of today, a few seconds after I opened the app it takes me to an upgrade screen and says I have to purchase premium. I have to work from home because of covid-19 and need my notes, and now Evernote is making me spend money? Great timing.",
      "2020-03-15 v8.13 - insert line bug is fixed!!! Note Upload bug still there. OLD -Ver 8.12.1 installed today. Still the issue with the horizontal line inserting at the END of the note, not at the cursor position. This has been an issue since the update in June 2019. The earlier bugs with notes taking a minute to load has been fixed but some notes with graphics are still slow but more like 5-10 seconds slow. Premium user since 2013. Currently Android 7.1.1. 2020-01-17 new update; insert line bug still not fixed; also dealing with a \"Note Upload\" bug for several months. The app does a great job for me but these bugs are adding editing time to my day."

      "The idea of having to pay yearly for a no ads premium version is absolutely unnecessary for simple notes. I dont mind a one time charge but these developers are definitely pushing it. This app used to be great but now your better off looking for something else, do not waste your time or money with this app. Garbage!",
      "I enjoyed this app for years. Until I updated. The ads are so obtrusive that there's barely any room to write.

      "I love this app. Really cute and makes note taking easy. The UI is good as well as backing up to Google drive; however update the app to allow synchronisation between devices to prevent data loss due to data being overwritten when restored to a second device; to keep backing up on one device and keep restoring to a different device and remembering to do so is too manual. Also, ability to change fonts, order of to do lists, arranging notes into individual folders are very important.",
      "I love using notepads and I can say with 110% Everybody should truly check this one out. It is by far the Best one I have ever used and I have tried out quite a lot of them. You name it, it has it. Style, color, so much to pick from and add in your own color, style,labels icons, and calendar. I recommend this one to All.",
      "I do really like the app but I hope u guys work on some small things to improve it like getting rid of ads which appears when accessing the app cos its kinda annoying. The other thing its the reminder, it does work but I wish I can be reminded on times I enter besides my tasks (things I enter on my Check list/Must Do List).. Also the font size, I hope I can change it according to the size I want cos it's too tiny for me 😁 Anyways thank you so much for the wonderful app I do recommend it!!",
      "I have a big problem because I forgot my password and when I put it I thoughtlet the password will lock the whole app but it actually lost only one note and it was very important to me and I needed to open it but now I actually forgot the password.it's a very big problem in the change the password to go around the password or a mail.is good but I have a problem I cannot insert photos after certain words you can only put them under all the words you wrote or the sentences. It is nice.",

If I were to be picky I'd ask for a \"share\" button and my personal preference for a \"folder view\" table of contents but having in mind it's meant to be SIMPLE and it was a FREE app, I am well satisfied.",
      "The app is really simple to use. It provides just what I look for when I download it… to write notes obviously, and it's just that. I've used it for nearly a year now (when combined with my previous phone) and I will keep using it in future too. I love it (｡>﹏<｡)",
      "Easy to use but it's frustrating that if your screen times out no changes are saved. Tedious to constantly have to save it at risk of losing changes. Otherwise good.",
      "Great app if you like a bit of customisation to your notes. Especially like the option to set a transparent background to notes pinned to my home screen.",
      "Works fine. Some small glitches like if you delete a note it switches to the note at the top of the list which is kinda silly. Other than that it's quite lovely for a few app."

      "Great app for basic note saving. Love that you can lock your notes with a password. Would give it 5 stars but you cannot do a screenshot of your notes. Twice now my phone has stopped working and I've had to replace it. I lost all my notes both times. Had I been able to do screenshots this wouldn't have happened. :UPDATE: Developer replied to my review within 15 mins. It IS possible to do a screenshot if you disable the password. 5 STARS!!",
      "A most fantastic app for keeping a private diary of thoughts/journaling! I've been using it for a few years & it's been very reliable & easy to use. Highly recommended. Edit 2020-02-09: My old phone broke & I restored my notes from the cloud. But my manual sort order (reverse alpha) was lost. So now my newest notes are at the bottom of about 200 notes & the app won't sort in reverse order! I emailed Support, but they said that's the way it is. So I'm reducing my rating until they fix it! Easy?",
      "Was using this app for a while, but just recently factory reset my phone. Tried to restore my notes from the cloud, but I have none of them. Worked well up until this point. Edit: I was able to get some of my notes restored, but some were still lost, even though I used the same account as before.",
      "The developer helped me in resolving the issue of restoring the backed up data from google drive. Now its back to normal. Kudos to the entire team. Keep Working like this. You have an amazing product.",
      "Best app ever. Private. Asking for passwprd or fingerprint everytime. Locks even after 1 min or of use. Such easy acess to store information. Which transfers online or to another phone woth no problem. Everything is always still there."

      "Been using it for over 7 years now. Still lovin it! Minimalist ad banner at top of screen (for the free version) is not a distraction like so many are. Such a good app! I'd have gladly paid $20 for a pro version just to show support and appreciation for the utility of this app, but unfortunately, their only upgrade option is a recurring subscription fee. I'm very generous with even the pricier pro upgrades, but I will never pay a recurring subscription fee for an app. Hint hint, dev team!",
      "I'm super upset. I lost three years worth of notes: recipes, songs, poems, dream diaries and passwords. All when I got a new phone due to some sync error. This app was so useful. Until I lost three years of progress that I did not have recorded anywhere else. If they are willing to help fix it I might change my review but personally. I'm super upset with this app and it's people.",
      "I've used the paid upgraded service for a couple months now with unlimited instant updates across all my devices. So far I find myself using it multiple times on a daily basis and it now helps me be and feel alot more mentally organized. I use it for shopping lists, to do task lists, life goal bucket list and even upcoming bill due dates and keeps me on track by not paying late fees anymore. Works out great for me and feels like having your own personal private assistant. A+ Highly Recommend!",
      "First app I dl! It's just amazing. Don't forget anything! Appointments and whatever you like. In date ordered. Could not see a phone without this app and can connect with cloud. Without any problem. Don't take long and your all set. Remember your music, TV shows, doctors appointments etc.",
      "Great for taking notes, reminders etc, can't fault it BUT suddenly I can't open the app unless I agree that it and Google can access all my personal info... Two options given, allow or deny.... and guess what? Press 'Deny' and you're in an endless loop of allow or deny windows.... Time to uninstall... except I can't access the information stored on notepad unless I agree to sharing all my personal info! B*t#r*s!"

      "Refreshingly different from other apps. I wanted somewhere safe for making simple notes and life goals etc. This does that without complicating things. The app is pin protected and I can have different colour notes with the option of secure online access. I've used Evernote before but this app is much better. Thank you for providing the important things without gimmicks. Would recommend.",
      "Amazing app, easy to use and fully customizable. The password protection is princess. Maybe if the future they'll add the option in setting to auto lock notes on exit, right now you have to remember to do it manually. But that isn't a big deal for me. Moreover it's free and ad free, so thank you developer for making this app and sharing it with everyone with no strings attached.",
      "The only problem I have with this app is I cannot attach pictures to the notes. Sometimes I will screen shot information that I need but can't put it in a note for later and future use. I will be uninstalling this app as soon as I find a notes app that will allow me to lock my notes (which this one does) and attach pictures.",
      "Good potentials. In setting there should be an option to auto lock note on exit. As the app is lock note, is it appropriate to have the option to leave it unlocked. I'm short, encryption and auto lock should be by default. To speed process, finger print access to app can be employed. A 2nd finger encryption can be used to lock and unlock notes . Good luck.",
      "Great, but I am concerned about the security level of the App-locking PIN; why only numbers? A string of numbers on their own makes a very weak password. Yes, you can add a strong password/passphrase to each note, but what about the titles/names you give to each note?... these get revealed by only typing in a sequence of numbers to open the app. There should, at least, be an 'option' in the settings to allow the user to choose a simple PIN or a more secure password/passphrase. Safe and secure?"

      "I loved this app. Seriously considered switching to this exclusively, however, there are some drawbacks. One, there isn't an option to sync to onedrive or googledrive. Huge issue for me, considering I really wanted a way to store all my notes in college. Two, I hate the organization of this app. I can't make folders or subfolders or color coding. Three, I hate the fact that I can't type notes as well. Sometimes I want to handwrite but other times I don't. I hope they update soon.",
      "There is an ink problem with using the Pixelbook Pen with i7 250 gb Pixel Slate. I tried using low-latency link but that introduces a horrible lag. While writing with the pen, sometimes the it just stops writing and then the writting that I did 5 seconds ago appears. If not it just leaves a dotted mark sometime rather than writing what I want it to write. A fix would be helpful given that I'm paid for the premium features.",
      "Liked it and upgraded to \"Pro\" as I needed to annotate some PDF files but then didn't use it for a few months. Can't use it now that I need it for more PDF work because it insists I \"Upgrade to Pro\" again. Nope. Six-fifty every few months is too expensive. Not gonna happen. There are other PDF tools that once bought, stay bought. Uninstalled.",
      "it has limited options like: (1). you can't copy a pdf file and insert on the note page. (2). it lacks objects e.g. shapes and fills that may as be like the available in good notes. (3) it does not have the option of hand write to text choice fonts. However, it is a good app only for note taking. You may have some difficulties if you are a good notes user. I may be bias with this but this is my opinion only. thanks",
      "Hi everyone, I tried several comparable apps for handwriting. I really suffered from a lag between touching the screen and an actual response, it made handwriting almost impossible. But in Squid such a lag is not noticeable, I just set a scale to 1000% and used my laptop as a paper notepad, loosing only a small amount of speed (but I guess it's due to my laptop and a pen itself, but not the software) I really like this app and appreciate your work, thank you guys P. S. I miss a calender option"

Exercise patience a few extra minutes, enter a couple notes & experience the free features included & well-thought interface with this supurb app. Back up solutions & plenty of options. Only issue I've found is there are no fast entry widgets, all have to hit -back -back when done editing. Otherwise, yes, donation -take a spin without experiencing ads. Thank You!",

      "Great app, best in it's category of what I have found in my years of to do list apps. Chocked full of great features. I used to use colornote until I found this app. It would be 5 stars, but they recently started putting ads and a paid version. I would be all for a one time purchase of 5 or 10 dollars, but it is more than that. I am very glad the developers did not go with a subscription based app; those are terrible. I get the need for a paid version of the app, but not $5 for each feature.....",
      "I love this app! Not to be dramatic or anything but it's kinda changed my life. So many awesome features (for free!!) that make it so much easier for me to stay organized and not forget things I need to do, places I need to go, ideas I have for later, etc. Just useful in so many ways, I've recommended it to several friends already.",
      "Really great App. I use it to manage my brain and my business. It takes the place of tons of sticky notes and notebooks. I show it to my clients too so they can stay more organized. Two things I would like to see would be to have an ability to Bold and Underline text as well as having a Tab feature so if I want to make a few lists within one \"note\" I can do that with multiple titles and subtitles. Also, I would like it if the Calendar would link with my Google Calendar, or I could delete the calendar page. Still, very nice app. A bit similar to Google Keep Notes, but I like the page tabs on this a bit better.",
      "I love this. It is a beautiful interface. It is so intuitive right out of the box, it feels like I have used it for years. The developers took extra care making it user friendly. I know app development is expensive. I used to work in software development. That is why I didn't mind buying the extras. I would rather have one great app instead of several okay apps.",
      "Latest version changelog: \"Bugfix: Stability fix.\" Ohh, and ads are added with option to remove them for 10$+. This does not seem right, to introduce ads this way. I know the app needs some kind of financial support, but not by introducing \"features\" in non transparent way. Edit: Changelog is updated. Price for ad-free version is a little steep."

      "I'm a big fan of this app! There's something just great about it! It's terrific! One suggestion though: How about making it so I can get my note back should I accidentally delete it? Update on review written on 2/1/20: Thank you for your kind and thoughtful reply to my comment. Your information about deletion was both helpful and informative. Love your app! Keep up the good work!",
      "Nice, quick, easy, note app. Great for jotting down finds on the internet, making reminders, it alarms, and general note taking. It has a very nice selection of fonts you can choose, and you can color you're notes. Wish though, it had simple date and time capabilities. l use this app for just about everything. Don't care for the lastest update, where I now must wait for the app's title to appear, and dissapear, before I can use it. Slows me down, and not necessary.",
      "It's super and simple... And Google backup is so helpful for safety of notes. Very useful app.",
      "I use it daily. I wish Search highlighted the word (like ColorNotes) when found or you may have to manually search a 5000 word document! GDrive backup is great.",
      "I love this simple app! I use notes for everything, from shopping and to do lists to copy and paste quotes and recipes. I literally open it at least 3 times a day."

      "This is a neat application for taking notes. Although I have not yet done much with it, it looks that it has great potential. The funniest part is a comment in one of the screenshots. “They don’t make bugs like Bunny anymore.” I recently watched some clips of Space Jam for the first time in a long time and some Bugs Bunny moments with a friend. The funniest moment was when Bugs was given an eye exam. Bugs read the fine print on the chart flawlessly, while the examiner used a magnifying glass. 🤣",
      "An easy 5 stars. I love good design and this is great design. It's a bit like Pinterest but more flexible. E.g. I can add not just one but several pictures above notes or a checklist (so useful), and I can add voice, and I can change the box colour to match my pictures, and other stuff too. My notes just got beautiful. The more I use it the more I love it.",
      "(Almost) all you need for notes with a sleek design. The design is elegant and easy to use. Great is that you can attach anything to a note. The only thing, I'm missing is a way to sync or export the notes with WebDAV and it would be great, if you can tick checklist items off by swiping",
      "Amazing app. Searching for a long long time for an app this complete and easy to use. Notes, reminders, checklists, labels, pin to notification bar, star as favourite etc. Very customizable but not overwelming. Automatic backup to Google Drive and the possibility to share a note including atachements via email.",
      "Sometimes I feel badly in need - customize the serial number which would go first, which would go 2nd? If I select 'title' then I don't get ascending/descending as my wish. If I select colour, then too I don't get my wishing serial. So I am wanting to tell you that add such a system so that I/we all can customize the serial number that whiich would be first, second or so on. (As our wish by customizing). Such, in youtube, if I make a playlist, I can place a video on bottom, top or as my wish."

I like the ability to add multiple pages behind each tab and the limit of 5 tabs doesn't seem a problem. However, the absence of a search function and an 'undo' facility does make it something I would use for appearance rather than functionality. It's never going to be my 'go-to' app, I'm afraid.",

Like, they have the Font Size button/option, but you can never change the font size; every time you try, it says \"Font Size Cannot be Changed.\" Why have it if you can't change it?? Also, I do understand ads... if it was a game or something, but this is for notes and organization; I shouldn't have to watch ads or see them at the top of the screen when I need to make a note of something or make my grocery list.",
      "I like this app because, I think that it is really helpful to the people who have a really busy schedule! Also i think it is a wonderful because it helps you get your thoughts in order and spread everything out into one app instead of having multiple apps to look after!",
      "On the \"To do list\" the set reminder could use more options for reminding. There's no set starting and stop option or all day reminder. Plus no option for notifications sounds to choose from your device setup. However the app is good. But needs more options, bells and whistles ☺️👍",
      "Awesome application for your to-do tasks, business meetings, hangouts,etc. I would highly recommend this as that you could turn on the alarms and off, type in the future events, and so much more. This is the best app I've ever encountered so far in memos and notes, and again I strongly recommend this app. Beginner planners, use. this. app. BEST. APP. EVER. And Pro Data Doctor, your gift of making and coding apps for memo and notes really stretches. Keep up the hard work!",

      "I got this app for the realistic sticky notes and stayed for it. I also like the option of fonts, font colour and size. Sadly, that bugged out after a while and the font wouldn't change from default. The UI of the app is a bit awkward and outdated, and choosing from a visible of options would be smoother than sequential choosing. This app has potential and I could see it being like textgram. Ads are fine.",
      "UPDATED: Thank you for removing those ads! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this app again! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would have given 10 stars before the ads and will gladly pay to get back what I had last week. I had enjoyed using the app all the time, now it is extremely difficult to amend or make up new memos because I can't see what I am typing. I really hope to love this app again if you make corrections.",
      "Wonderful little app and widgets. Just enough customisation choices for variety without being overwhelming. Font choices seem to stop working on the widgets at a certain size, and a text size between 18 (tiny) and 26 (huge) would be incredibly useful. Otherwise, I'm impressed. My days of installing, testing and subsequently deleting endless sticky note apps are finally done.",
      "Fantastic! There's no reason to forget anything of importance anymore, just flick one or more of these onto your home screen. I've been using it (on & off) for years and I'm a happy chappy. Ps. Dev, Thanks for opening up all features for a small sacrifice of unobtrusively small ads.",
      "Jan 2020 1st... Developers quick to respond to my earlier post.. this is a really nice app. Easy to use and l have been able to put all the notes l wanted onto the notes ie large as in A4 size plus plus... like the variety of choice of notes and colours.. flowers one would be nice... Realky liked it but now all this ad business, was really one of the best of these apps out there. I am annoyed l paid then soon after you made it product free so you can place ads!!! Glad you get 2 stars"

I really recommend this!",
      "I love this app a lot. You know I feel very relieved after writing in it. You get very cute backgrounds also to make your notes look more pretty and cute. This is the best thing I like about this app. You can make a few folders as well to give your notes a good title this also a nice thing about this app ❤️💛💚💙💜",
      "I love Cute Note as I have been using it to jot down notes for my schoolwork and write down tasks and homework I need to do. I love that there's so many designs for how you want the background of your digital note pad to look and you can change text size to your liking and adjust the words to make them centered or to the side with ease. I definitely recommend people to use Cute Note.",

I can keep personal quotes I want to remind myself of or create a to-do list in a place easily seen and accessible. There are countless characters and designs for whatever suits your style. So glad I found this app!"

I'm more than happy to support the devs with a paid subscription as they are not just providing everyone with a reliable and secure place for note taking and file storage, they are hosting syncing services as well which you can't do for free. The extensions which are made available in return are well worth it.",
      "I am moving away from using One Note in favor of this and I'm really blown away by the capabilities offered through the extensions, notes in markdown is just what I needed and it's super cool to have the flexibility exactly the way you want it as a user. The only thing that jumps out to me as missing right now is the ability to draw using touch screens. 10/10 otherwise!!",
      "I love the concept, business plan, and privacy, but the apps need work. On a Google Pixel 2 running Android 9 the app refuses to unlock after the phone is put in standby. You have to close the app and reopen it which is a huge pain. I've also had sync issues across multiple devices where sometimes Standard Notes creates another copy when it detects a conflict and sometimes just gives up and forces you to log out and start over potentially losing data on that device. OneNote wins on sync.",
      "Love it! After I switched away from Googles services, I tried out about 15 different notes apps to replace Keep, and Standard Notes is hands-down the winner. Awesome job guys, keep it up! If you upgrade to the pro version, there's tons of plugins and features: tags, editors, themes, secure lock, pin notes ets. And it's truly cross-platform too! This makes it a viable alternative to EverNote, OneNote, Dropbox Paper etc. The difference with S Notes is that it's secure, private and trustworthy",
      "It seems like a great app but I think having a list option (as in checklist) would be a very nice improvement to see added sometime. Other than that, at first glance I think it has everything I want, so thanks."

    "title":"Classic Notes Lite - Notepad",
    "description":"Classic Notes is designed to be a straightforward and simple to use notepad application yet powerful and feature rich at the same time. Classic Notes is much more than a standard notepad. Also included is a vast assortment of utilities which can be found in the extras section. Think of this application as a sort of multi-tool. Please continue reading to learn more.\r\n\r\n* Notepad Features *\r\n- In addition to standard notes and memos,  Classic Notes also includes shopping lists, paint or sketch notes, and to-do lists. \r\n- As mentioned above, one of the goals when designing this application was to be feature rich but with ease of use in mind. To access additional features when writing a note simply click the edit button located at the top left to gain access to a wide array of additional options. \r\n- Some of these options include: attaching audio, video, and image files, tagging, setting priority based on urgency, reminders and alarms, password protection, comments also known as sub-notes, linking notes and to-do's together, pinning notes to the status bar or home screen, detailed note information such as word and character count, you can even look at the history of a note and revert to previous states. This is just a small handful of what's available. There are many more features to explore!\r\n- Also included is a trash bin so you never have to worry about accidentally deleting a note again.\r\n\r\n* Extras *\r\n- In addition to being a notepad, Classic Notes also features numerous useful utilities which can be accessed from the extras menu. This is where the multi-tool part comes in.\r\n- Some of these utilities include an extremely capable unit converter with over 100 different types of conversions and thousands of different units to choose from, a powerful random number generator utility, full-featured finance, numerical, fitness, and audio calculators, and a days until countdown timer are just a small handful of what's available.I could on and on about all the features and utilities available but I'd run out of space. \r\n- Utilities also include the option to make a note of the data for later use. For instance, say one is using the fitness calculator to look up their target heart rate.

Classic Notes is much more than a standard notepad. Also included is a vast assortment of utilities which can be found in the extras section. Think of this application as a sort of multi-tool. Please continue reading to learn more.<br><br>* Notepad Features *<br>- In addition to standard notes and memos,  Classic Notes also includes shopping lists, paint or sketch notes, and to-do lists. <br>- As mentioned above, one of the goals when designing this application was to be feature rich but with ease of use in mind. To access additional features when writing a note simply click the edit button located at the top left to gain access to a wide array of additional options. <br>- Some of these options include: attaching audio, video, and image files, tagging, setting priority based on urgency, reminders and alarms, password protection, comments also known as sub-notes, linking notes and to-do&#39;s together, pinning notes to the status bar or home screen, detailed note information such as word and character count, you can even look at the history of a note and revert to previous states. This is just a small handful of what&#39;s available. There are many more features to explore!<br>- Also included is a trash bin so you never have to worry about accidentally deleting a note again.<br><br>* Extras *<br>- In addition to being a notepad, Classic Notes also features numerous useful utilities which can be accessed from the extras menu. This is where the multi-tool part comes in.<br>- Some of these utilities include an extremely capable unit converter with over 100 different types of conversions and thousands of different units to choose from, a powerful random number generator utility, full-featured finance, numerical, fitness, and audio calculators, and a days until countdown timer are just a small handful of what&#39;s available.I could on and on about all the features and utilities available but I&#39;d run out of space. <br>- Utilities also include the option to make a note of the data for later use. For instance, say one is using the fitness calculator to look up their target heart rate. There is no need to copy and paste the results, simply click the note option and all values are recorded into a new note for easy access whenever you want it.",

      "I love it! The most important for me is that you can create a lot of shopping list not just one like others apps. And you can put a price on each item not like others apps. So it is very useful for me because a like to have differet counts for each market and activity. You can also organize your notes and other stuff by folders and that is very useful. Thank you so much!",
      "Great app!! Very easy to use and many options are there! But i think it would've been better if I could choose colors for my notes!",
      "Very good as it has loads of different categories and is very easy to use. The only reason that I haven't given it 5 stars, is that on the Shopping List, the prices are in Dollars and I have to convert them to Pounds. Is there a setting anywhere that I can change please?",
      "I have used this app for years now. It is a great place to store handy info, and I find the extras helpful also.",
      "One of the best features of this app is the shopping list you can make and set pricing of items. You can mark each item as you obtain them and the app will keep the remaining total as well as the list total so you can see just how much you have left. Perfect for planning your spending. I used it for computer parts as a test and it helped me decide and keep track of parts I should get now and which I should hold off on."

      "This is my favorite app of all time. Stop reading & download. The rest is for the developers. Seriously missing a sign in/access to notes made on different devices. Can't import a backup file within. Dedicated delete button should be present & ability to delete multiple notes at once. I'm broke and never bought an app, but I'd easily pay $10 to $1/m if I had access to notes across an account. The rest is nitpicking. This is complex & costly, but I hope it helps put ya'll in that direction.",
      "Have been using Quick Notes for a long time but prefer the features of this app... especially the ability to rearrange notes manually and also rearrange items in lists. Would like an option to display the complete list of notes contents on start page if possible. A very well thought out application. Love that I don't have to tap \"save\" all the time.",
      "Great. Only one issue/complaint: Please add an option for postponing the lock feature in Vault, when the app goes to background. Working with Vault with immediate locking, when the app goes to background, makes the UX really inconvenient for many users. It's a long time I've been hoping for this feature to be added to the app. Waiting for your response. Thanks.",
      "Brilliant and Well Developed Notes App!!!!! You have a truly gorgeous and incredible app here and if I may I have a couple of ideas for it the first is the ability to have the app open to the default category instead of all notes and the other one is the ability to colorize and change the color of the app header other than that you have a amazing and unique app!!!!!",

      "I really like this app. It's definitely the best notes app I've been able to find, and trust me I've tried a ton of them. I love that I can make checklists so easily. Honestly I don't know what I'd do without this app because I seriously use it for everything.",
      "Pretty fine note taking application. The widget part is incredibly useful. Wish it were more configurable (font weight, size, etc.), though.",
      "I love this app!!! I have been looking for a notepad app where I could make a checklist cuz I am such an organized person... And this one has it!... It is very helpful... I would most definitely recommend it!!!",
      "Easy to use, especially for people who have little knowledge of the internet and no idea how to understand the complicated advanced apps"

I like that the app respects my phone privacy and does not collect lots of info. in the future I would like the ability to check items on the list and a quick delete option where once I buy/do something I can check it off or delete it quickly without deleting whole list. Good app. basic, clean, simple.",
      "Fabulous! I looked a long time for an app like this. The author did everything right, and included useful options most developers overlook. I have just 3 requests: • Can you make the name more distinctive? For example, add part of your own name to it, or a city you like, etc.? It's called \"Notepad Notes and List\" here—but I tried searching for it from another device, so a friend could try it, and I was lost in a sea of \"Notepad\" apps. (On my phone, it's called just \"Notepad\".. It even has a different icon!) • Will you please fix the Font Size option? • Will you include the option of a serif font, rather than just the non-serif one? I find serif fonts much easier to read. Thanks!",
      "HELP!!😥 I had downloaded this app, I think it's very nice. But the only thing is, I had typed out an very important document and when I went to save it there was no save button, so I pushed the ✓ mark, hoping to save it. Lost my document, can you help to restore it? It was the 24 of December when this happened. Thanks",

As something happens I wish to record, I quickly make an entry & title it. It makes finding & rereading much quicker & easier. Nice mood stickers & gentle feather reminder to journal. However, no notes book as advertised.",
      "I absolutely love this app thank you so much the interface and everything is amazing i just have one issue and i hope you can fix that in you next update? I wish i could select the entries i wanna add to the a word file instead of all the entries at once that would really help me out a lot please do something about that i beg you i cannot find any other app as good as this one and i really don't wanna stop using it for such a simple issue🙆",
      "First impression is what counts right? Theme isn't progressed by how many notes you write, giving anxiety about not writing enough like other journal apps I've seen. Basic simple themes for those not looking for flash, just needing to compose thoughts. Alerts available, lock available, pictures available free. As far as I'm concerned this app meets my requirements without extra payment",
      "Over all great app, but I just wish that the font sizes can be adjusted and that the pictures could be viewed in full sizes",
      "App looks simple enough but letdown by inability to select multiple photos to entry. This should be fixed as it's hard to add on other photos everytime."

I've been looking for a convinient but simple Notepad App with Voice Note features and I find this one cool. Plus, I hope your backup/cloud storage system is functioning great as well. Great App. Thank you.",

I use it constantly, and so far it's the only app I've found that's really good for plotting and outlining writing projects. I do wish there was a way for me to drag around and reorganize entire boards within the main screen, but thays a minor annoyance on an otherwise stellar app.",
      "The OG of Post-it Notes. The under appreciated invention that had all office workers to be reminded of their pending tasks, because of its striking yellow colour, surely not to be missed even on your most unproductive days. Now, its on your phone, add the widget to your home screen, boom!! Could not get any better. Hats off to the team on this great app.",
      "I like the idea, but Google Keep is simply better. I like the idea of this app because it's colorful, you can pin notes as a widget, and it's fun. But I use Google keep to copy/ paste text from computer to computer. This app doesn't save over the internet, so my notes won't show up another phone or computer.",
      "The handwriting recognition is a really useful tool. An useful upgrade to it could be a language recognizer so the user could select a language and the software could recognize the text on the post it and correct grammar errors when transforming it to digital text. In this way the recognition could have a broader efficiency margin",
      "Had to reset my phone, reinstalled the app and my notes are gone. If there was some sort of sign in, this could be avoided. Need to be able to use different fonts in digital notes. Potential for a very good app."

      "A good secure app for storing personal information. However, over recent months a problem has arisen with the line spacings when using 'Text' mode. Thw wrap around text feature goes to double spacing instead of single spacing which is very frustrating. I'm very surprised at this stage that the developer has not fixed this problem.",

I have messaged Skipser on Facebook and through his blog. I have tried multiple times to join his forum for support, but reached only an error message. I have stored information in my sec note app that I would really like to use. Anyone have advice? I have not heard from Arun the developer, so I have uninstalled the Sec Notes App.",

This is great but... That also means I can't share it across devices. Not a big deal for me. Also I had to buy an upgrade to do this (less than $2)",

      "I love this app...I love that I can create my own note style, color, ect. I had this on my last 2 phones this is the third one. I've used this app for many years now. Keep up the good work...just wish we could earn couns faster than we do other than buying them. Other than that great app I recommend it.",
      "Pretty sweet app, BUT It's funny because I will be sitting here making notes & all of a sudden EVERYTHING will just disappear and I won't be able to find it anywhere. So,now i'm sitting here mad trying to remember everything I had on my list lol. But other than that I like this App pretty well. Just a couple minor bugs that need fixed and I'm sure it'll be perfect 💯🙏",
      "Well I downloaded this about 3 hours ago and so far I keep getting interrupted by google wanting a star rating. It's really aggravating 😤. How about people have some time to actually use the app before giving a star rating and/or a review. I'm thinking google would get a more honest response and a higher rating for thos app.",
      "It's cute and it's fun...but now it froze up on me. I just uninstalled and reinstalled it... it's still frozen and not working. I tried the free version and I don't like it after having the plus.",
      "Its adorable and easy to use! To do list aren't my thing, but the older I get I realize I need to make them my thing! This colorful, fun app makes the kid in me hate adult tasks a little less 😋 Thanks for a fun option in list apps!!"

      ". Easy to use. I had this app in Costa Rica on my phone. Purchased a new phone and downloaded. My previous version had more flexibility with colors and symbols. I decided to purchase hoping i could change colors/symbols of the notes but wasn't able to do so . If I had more flexibility I would have given a 5. I may look for another note app with more flexibility. Great customer service raised my stars to 5 because that",
      "Great app but still having one quirk. The app won't allow me to go from one open list/note to another, without having to completely close the app (also from recent apps) before reopening it to see all of my notes. The people in charge of this app looked into the last review within only hours from posting and fixed the other quirk that I mentioned before the day was out. If you want a great app that truly responds to it's users. This is it.",
      "It's an awesome app but it won't tell me how to set a pun it only says re set other than that it is great it really me organised I would give I five start but they let them self's down by not telling me how to set a pin if are not organised and you what to be get this app or it could be really use full if you have a bust job",
      "Just started using it. It does not have a menu so once you type your entry there is nothing much you can to with. There is also no title area. The ads are very annoying. Other than that, it seems OK.",
      "I love this app but since the update, it wont let me exit out of my notes. For example: if I'm making a list and try to back out of it, it wont let me, I have to restart my whole phone in order for it to work!"

      "UPDATE: Problem was that I wasn't getting the menu for kind of note. Presently it's working correctly. I have upgraded my rating to 5 stars. [My fave app is broken! After it wasn't able to break up text, they fixed that. I was being able to write paragraphs and it was formatting them fine. Today, I returned to the app and it's again not giving me the ability to write complete sentences that can be divided into paragraphs. It forces me to use checkboxes. ONE sentence per box.]",
      "I just needed a simple and secure way to keep my information. This one works quite well and backup is done on your phone and not online. Purchased the app so i cab make use of the fingerprint unlock option. Really cheap. Found an issue with the dark mode though. All the fonts dont switch to a white color when dark mode is enabled. Hope they fix this.",
      "Although everything works fine, this is already a second time happens that I lost one \"Note\" and this time was a really important one and it pissed me off. I also checked both times the trash and there was nothing. So, what's going on? I'll give it a one more chance, hoping that it won't let me lose again any of my important data... Xiaomi redmi note 7.",
      "The only problem I felt with this app is easy access to delete what I saved. With just one simple swipe the file I worked for ,got deleted. Putting a delete option will help to solve the problem.",
      "Really good stuff. I don't know how secure is it, storing text unencrypted on the sd card, or only in the RAM, or not, or what? But the app is really simple but really practical. I like it. It deserves the high five"
