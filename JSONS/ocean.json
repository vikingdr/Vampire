      "Great game play! Only problem I've come across while playing is the missions arent wanting to accept when completed like if opened the bunker twice, and second time I finally got a new quest for a key card but now it's not letting me move forward in the story after building the radio thing to supposedly look for the lost key card. Other than that it's a great game but I think it might still have a few kinks in it. I also have a few other questions concerning the game play.",
      "It can be fun but for some reason, the quests do not always work. I.e. collect 20 wood resources by water or island, but it won't work. You'll collect double and it will still say 16/20 collected. Even viewing a video ad to add progress does absolutely nothing. Just wastes time. It is not possible to achieve all of the quests. Please fix.",
      "The sky and lighting effects are phenomenal and the building can be tedious but it is straightforward. I'm also in level 32 limbo, and many parts of the islands are not functioning. The Flower is a lie! There is also no way to buy items as all transactions are declined. That is what puzzles me the most. My dream raft is built, saved, and waiting for the update that will open the rest of the game. Godspeed, devs.",
      "Love the game. Hate the bugs. I keep hitting glitches when I travel. The first time I went to a different raft it said I broke the door but couldn't get through. I restarted the game from the beginning, now I can't get to a different island. Would love to play further if I could, I really like the game.... If you're having issues adjusting the screen side to side, just adjust the sensitivity to 100% and it's way easier.",
      "I had just got this game a couple of days ago. I am really enjoying it. I am having a problem though. When I tried to travel to the first island, it took about a day and a half (irl) to do so. Now I'm having trouble getting back to my raft. Am I doing something wrong... I've searched the island, gathered what I could. Clicked on my raft... nothing. Some insight or advice would be very helpful. Again, I am enjoying this game and I don't want something so small to ruin my thoughts of it. Thanks."

      "Love this game however the update took some key things away. The watch videos for coins was very helpful...maybe bring that back. :D I do like the zombies being at every area, makes it more of a challenge. But the inventory or loot seems lower at these locations. Makes fighting the zombies not worth the waste in ammo when loot is small. Still love the game and will play forever!",
      "I love this game, I love to build and all the things you guys have in here to build a house and make it feel like a home is great, the only things I don't see is livingroom furniture everything else is there. As to filling up water bottles I don't have a problem with. The thing that I find weird is that my truck disappeared, otherwise this is my go to destresser keep up good work and looking forward to updates....",
      "I love the game but keep getting an invisible barrier everytime I try to go to the other island. Even if I have enough fuel in the boat, or if I try to swim there are. Very annoying. Now it seems like I'm done with exploring because I'm stuck on one Island and there's nothing else to do and no new resources to move ahead. Im lv 16 btw.",
      "I love the game however I feel like it is a bit boring. I feel like adding in natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc would make it much more realistic and much more fun to play. It would make it feel like an actuall surivival game. At this point all i really have to do is make sure i dont starve to death, die of thirst or get eaten by a wild animal and when you've had the game for as long as I have that gets very tedious.",

Grass can come up out of the wooden foundation....... Zombies should be removed and our friendlies should be added which could be with us to help each other....."

      "If your looking for a good decent survival game for mobile than this is definitely it! I'm currently having a blast with this game however the reason i can't give it five stars is because the amount of ads in the game is disgusting. You seriously get a pop up ad at the start of every day in game which isn't cool but if that was toned down I'd give it five stars.",
      "It wasn't bad. It it could definitely use improvement, I was really displeased with how often you became thirsty and hungry in survival- it often gets pretty annoying how often I would miss loot or plenty if other things because I had to constantly produce water and fish basically just to keep up with the food and water needs",
      "Amazing game, good graphics, great for passing time. Recommend downloading. This is the best game i have found yet! The only problem is that i cant move objects i have placed already on a floor above or below the one it was origionally on, is there a way to do this? Also, how do i get to the islands?",
      "The game is very nice but after you create an update please fix some problems like ive been sunk into the water then i die when i respawn im in underwater again,another problem is the jumping problem sometimes when you are in a water the jump button wont work pls fix all of that and ill give this game a 5 stars!.And also add some creative mode.",
      "It's pretty good. I just wish there was more to the building. Like torches for example. More furniture. Variety in enemies, weather, more food options. It's a good start but feels a bit lacking after awhile since you run out of things to do and work towards."

      "Found this game and absolutely love it. However, videos seem to glitch out. Had an iPhone to begin with and was getting videos to watch for splashcash etc. After a time I wasn't able to watch any videos anywhere to boost my gameplay. When I explained to the developers what was happening I was told the problem was my phone. I went out and brought a brand new Samsung A20 in November 2019. As of last week I haven't been able to receive any videos to watch yet again. Highly disappointed with this!",
      "I am really sorry to rate this game now 2 stars. its been giving me problems since I downloaded it. keeps on telling me to reload sanctuary and now to top it off I can't connect to either my facebook or twitter to get more friends. it bombs out and then I am back at my sactuary. please guys fix this so I can get my friend to play along then only I will give it a 5 star. thank you",
      "Why is it that now im.on level 31 and now I cant get my rewards or play videos to earn things... it's very frustrating and I love this game but if I'm not able to get my stuff I'm gonna uninstall it.. dont want to but I will if we keep getting glitches non stop",
      "I give this game five stars simply because there aren't any annoying pop up ads. You can actually still choose to watch ads for rewards. Thank you thank you thank you. A lot of good games are ruined but pop up ads. Also the game it self is really fun.",
      "Beautiful and engaging.... At first. It's a shame that the game is designed to allow less and less interaction. On the positive, at least it prevents you from wanting to spend $ on it. Fun lasts a little less than a week"

      "I've used this Lwp on every mobile I've own since 1998. I love it, it's vibrant and smooth, and always plays well, will not hiccups. However, the only issue he have is the add ons that you pay for. The extra packages that include sharks or Dolphins, or turtles, which I have had to buy repeatedly throughout the time. Even though I've used the same email address which should allow my account to recognise me. I can honestly say that is the only bugbare this LWP.",

      "I love love love these wallpapers but nowdays when I install them, they don't work. I'm using an Honor 6X phone. They install just fine but once I've set them as my wallpaper, I can't change any settings. They just keep loading and loading and I'm never able to personalize or even set iup like I want to. This happened with Forest HD as well. Dualboot was kind enough to contact me and let me know that, while they don't have a fix for this yet, they willing to refund me.",
      "This is still the most impressive and least memory/battery hungry ocean WP to date. Even thu last update is yrs ago. Have run on all my Huawei smart phones and tabs for the last 3 yrs with no issue. Purchased all the add-ons.. Well worth it",
      "I have got angry. This app is not working properly. What the of this app was ocean hd free. No hd. Only ocean. Update new version that makes me happy then I will change my ratings. Try to update the app. I will download the app again after a month. (i.e.1/11/2018) All the best"

No collision detection for moving creatures and plants - you just go through them causing parts of the creatures to disappear.",

Would you please look into this then I will write an updated review when this glitch is sorted.",

If so, someone please correct me and teach me how to build the 2nd floor without taking all the spaces on the first floor by the pillars.",
      "This is one of the best mobile games out there! I have always loved this game but this update was superb! This is like a console game to me! I love the intro! All the detail on this game is amazing! The waves change in intensity and the raft rocks on the waves! The lighting is awesome! The weather affects are so cool! Fog, rain, thunderstormes and the clouds change shape and move! Love how you interact with objects so realistic! Great job developers! I love this game!",
      "The game is good but I completed it in one day, it would be really mad if there was more to the game like you found other survivors and then they become part of your crew you could get them to do things too But over all game is pretty good It would be nice if there was other animals like more sea life and birds in the sky",
      "This is a good game and fairly easy to play. I really like the new update as I was running out of things I could do without some kind of storage. I just wished it was worth building a dwelling as the rain just goes straight through. There are now beds and tables and they moved the coconut (you can still grow them) use to a higher lvl hich is a pain. Still don't know how to use furnace though üòÅ a few bugs I hope they can sort out next time. Have a signal gun!",
      "This is pretty good, even if it is a copycat game. It's easy to learn, mostly very intuitive. The graphics are good for mobile, animations are nice. The leveling curve is even: not difficult, but not a game you can leave idle either. Most of the negative reviews are left by kids complaining that the game is too hard or scary, or people who want to play a survival game that isn't challenging (if that sounds like you, then maybe survival games aren't for you)."

    "title":"Odyssey of the Ocean",
    "description":"Odyssey of the Ocean is a 3D-maritime adventure game based on a realistic, geographic system. In this game, the player will take on the role of a high-seas commander. Adventurers from different countries and regions will chart new courses to open up new naval routes, while also engaging in battle.\r\n‚ÄªBackground Story:\r\n In AD 800, Kievan Rus‚Äôcontrolled the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, the Abbasid Caliphate controlled the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and, thus, the Ottoman Empire controlled the vast majority of the Mediterranean. However, this wasn‚Äôt enough. We always want what we do not have; humans, by their very nature, are always seeking to expand their boundaries. People began to wonder, for instance, what is hidden beneath the waves: buried treasure or killer sea monsters? Everyone had been hearing that the earth was round, but there wasn‚Äôt any proof. Magellan went on a voyage across the world and changed that forever. You can change the world too. Commander, lead your troops onto the high seas. Dock in foreign ports, and plant your flag in distant lands!\r\n‚ÄªGame Characteristics:\r\n‚óÜThe Guild battle has begun. Who will emerge victorious?\r\nThree main forces have gathered on the open seas: the Abbasid Caliphate and their brilliant civilization, Kievan Rus‚Äô, descendants of the Vikings and the powerful Ottoman Empire. The trumpets of war have sounded, and the armies are fast approaching. Who will conquer the oceans? Commander, it is time for you to show what you‚Äôve got!\r\n‚óÜReal time, naval PVP battles, slaughter your enemies and become king!\r\nPlunder passing ships, gather allies to defeat the World BOSS, participate in Arena challenges, large-scale, multiplayer PVP battles, tons of combat modes to choose from, who could ask for anything more? Commander, time waits for no man. Let‚Äôs get started!\r\n‚óÜHidden treasure is waiting for you! Go acquire some new wealth!\r\nWe have hidden more than 100 buried treasures in the sea. These are gifts from Sea God. Maybe you‚Äôll find Gold or Silver; maybe you‚Äôll find a new warship‚Ä¶.or maybe you‚Äôll encounter a killer sea monster! It all depends on your luck!\r\n‚óÜGorgeous skill effects, a smooth combat experience\r\nWe have developed a unique skill set for each captain. They can advance on an enemy and attack, or fall back into a defensive position. Recruit legendary sea captains like Babarosa Hayreddin the ‚ÄúRedbeard‚Äù and Edward Thatch, the \"Blackbeard\" and fly into battle!\r\n‚óÜExquisite combat vessels, equipment set bonuses\r\nWe‚Äôve designed 24 types of warships and 14 equipment sets. Let‚Äôs say you own the ‚ÄúFlying Dutchman‚Äù and then obtain protection from ‚ÄúPoseidon, the Sea God‚Äù. Well, you‚Äôll have enough power to crush your enemies.\r\n‚óÜJoin guilds, because there‚Äôs strength in numbers!\r\nYou‚Äôll find players from many different countries and regions. Join up with them and form guilds to pool your resources. Guilds will provide you with superior protection as well.\r\n‚óÜA unique home construction system will allow you to create your own safe haven.\r\nCustomize your home with tons of different options.

    "descriptionHTML":"Odyssey of the Ocean is a 3D-maritime adventure game based on a realistic, geographic system. In this game, the player will take on the role of a high-seas commander. Adventurers from different countries and regions will chart new courses to open up new naval routes, while also engaging in battle.<br>‚ÄªBackground Story:<br> In AD 800, Kievan Rus‚Äôcontrolled the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, the Abbasid Caliphate controlled the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and, thus, the Ottoman Empire controlled the vast majority of the Mediterranean. However, this wasn‚Äôt enough. We always want what we do not have; humans, by their very nature, are always seeking to expand their boundaries. People began to wonder, for instance, what is hidden beneath the waves: buried treasure or killer sea monsters? Everyone had been hearing that the earth was round, but there wasn‚Äôt any proof. Magellan went on a voyage across the world and changed that forever. You can change the world too. Commander, lead your troops onto the high seas. Dock in foreign ports, and plant your flag in distant lands!<br>‚ÄªGame Characteristics:<br>‚óÜThe Guild battle has begun. Who will emerge victorious?<br>Three main forces have gathered on the open seas: the Abbasid Caliphate and their brilliant civilization, Kievan Rus‚Äô, descendants of the Vikings and the powerful Ottoman Empire. The trumpets of war have sounded, and the armies are fast approaching. Who will conquer the oceans? Commander, it is time for you to show what you‚Äôve got!<br>‚óÜReal time, naval PVP battles, slaughter your enemies and become king!<br>Plunder passing ships, gather allies to defeat the World BOSS, participate in Arena challenges, large-scale, multiplayer PVP battles, tons of combat modes to choose from, who could ask for anything more? Commander, time waits for no man. Let‚Äôs get started!<br>‚óÜHidden treasure is waiting for you! Go acquire some new wealth!<br>We have hidden more than 100 buried treasures in the sea. These are gifts from Sea God. Maybe you‚Äôll find Gold or Silver; maybe you‚Äôll find a new warship‚Ä¶.or maybe you‚Äôll encounter a killer sea monster! It all depends on your luck!<br>‚óÜGorgeous skill effects, a smooth combat experience<br>We have developed a unique skill set for each captain. They can advance on an enemy and attack, or fall back into a defensive position. Recruit legendary sea captains like Babarosa Hayreddin the ‚ÄúRedbeard‚Äù and Edward Thatch, the &quot;Blackbeard&quot; and fly into battle!<br>‚óÜExquisite combat vessels, equipment set bonuses<br>We‚Äôve designed 24 types of warships and 14 equipment sets. Let‚Äôs say you own the ‚ÄúFlying Dutchman‚Äù and then obtain protection from ‚ÄúPoseidon, the Sea God‚Äù. Well, you‚Äôll have enough power to crush your enemies.<br>‚óÜJoin guilds, because there‚Äôs strength in numbers!<br>You‚Äôll find players from many different countries and regions. Join up with them and form guilds to pool your resources. Guilds will provide you with superior protection as well.<br>‚óÜA unique home construction system will allow you to create your own safe haven.<br>Customize your home with tons of different options. Commander, develop your home to serve as a testament to your brilliance.<br>‚óÜLight up the 12 constellations to guide you on your quest.<br>For centuries, seafarers have relied on the stars to guide them. Go to the Observatory to watch the stars. The illuminated constellations will show you the way forward, so you never get lost.<br>‚óÜA precise commerce system; it‚Äôs fun to trade!<br>We‚Äôve set up 143 ports across the 7 seas and 4 great oceans.

      "Great game so far. Fun and interesting battles. Lots to do but at your own pace. My only negative comment is that the server connection constantly lags out whenever you do anything. Maybe you can get a hosted server for North America so we can have a smoother gameplay experience?",
      "So ive been playing for a week now. I like the game. I really do. Heres why im giving it 1 star for now. Theres so much in the game that has zero explanation. The merchant ships i send out collect millions in profit yet i never see a penny of it. Hot items at any harbor NEVER list a harbor youve been to . Every single item, and theres thousands, will all say unknown harbor. But it tell you to inquire in the pub yet doesnt tell you how. Everything you do in pub changing nothing. Very frustrating.",
      "uninstalled, started on server 5, bought the first recharge pack, after a few days server was laggy and unplayable in uk made a bug report that was never aknowledged, changed server to server 3 and after a game crash lost my new level 15 character with another starter pack... lost money twice, stay away from that game",
      "Can only give 4 stars at the moment as thereWas a few problems when first downloaded but it's a new game and a lot have been fixed now and the game is quite good still some things to sort like match ups I'm a low level player yet get matched up against a mega player in arena hopefully they will sort out to help new players .",
      "A wonderful remake of an ancient browser game hereby becoming a 2,5D exploratory adventure almost with same 2,5D from Diablo Expansion. Exploration kings of small navy ships are fascinated by the periodical fights-trades-navigation-exploration-research, build, advancement, development, investment they make every next minute. All along with a shinny musical background. Nice game. Can get even better to full 3D for players with good phones and more dedication to the game."

      "I am a long-time fan of Ocean. The app has the feature to listen to books, which is very cool for taking walks. The one complaint I have for this is that it loads very slowly on startup and doesn't move smoothly and efficiently from one screen to the next. The interface (UI) took me a little bit to decipher as well. It should be easier to return to the spot where you stopped reading or listening. Not that it's hard now. Just a little hiccupy.",
      "What's going on? I've used ocean for years. Now I've downloaded it onto my Moto E5, and I can't open it. I get a sign-in screen (I've never signed into ocean before) that doesn't let me do anything. It's beyond frustrating when a well-loved app no longer works. Can can you help?",
      "Maybe i'm just having a challenge with the changes, but the old Ocean seemed easier to use.",
      "A very useful and feature-rich application.",
      "I love this idea, but this app will not load on this tablet. Keeps saying it had a loading error. This device is a Samsung Galaxy Pro note. On another device, a samsung Galaxy Tab A, it will not download some titles like the Dawn-breakers. The app is also a little slow in coming up and the opportunity to download does not stay up long or does not come up at all on smaller books."

      "I love this game. Super calm and relaxing. I love the fish and the view. It's great! However, I find myself not having enough life or food to play for more than a minute or two, even with my life at a x12 multiplier and my food at a x9 multiplier. There should be more ways to earn food and life and/or lower the cost of the fish/food consumption.",
      "Okay this is going to sound like promoting the app but im just saying what i genuinely think. Its really well made. Its relaxing, soothing, fun, simple, bright, colourful, addictive and just really nice to play. The UI is easy to navigate and the fish make you feel like you are caring for them. THE FISH ACT LIKE FISH! Every other fish based aquarium app i have had the fish have acted like... not fish. These ones do. All in all, great app fun and relaxing. Well done guys!",
      "i like the game but it would be great if there was a way to regain my levels. i had to start over and thres no option to regain all that i had.",
      "Cool at first. They jack prices up after buying every fish that you cant get ahead. Iv spent $20 and didnt get far. If it wasnt for raising the prices so high i would keep this game and rate 5 star. Unless you plan to spwnd $100 plus expect to be disappointed.",
      "PAY TO PLAY! Got to level 19, and now cannot get enough resources to move forward without paying. They trick you with dolphins, and it all goes to PTP. I'm still enjoying the game. The graphics are really cool, and I'd like to see much more added to the game play. If you're going to drop money, this game has the potential to be worth it. Really needs a widget to watch & play on."

Is when the shark swims up close to your screne. It be awesome if you could interact with it like you do with the fish & pottery. Maybe make the shark bite at your finger tip for a momentary jump scare when you touch the screne. That would be epic!! üíôüêüüê†",
      "Had it for a few days, real pretty. Only reason i didnt give ot 5 stars is because it needs more sharks and rays ( more than 1) but really enjoying this wallpaper. Even set it to lock screen has well",
      "Asked me to rate. I always give lower scores when an app asks me to post a rating as soon as I use it. Find it rude and desperate. It's pretty. Will update once I get more used to it and, especially, get a feel for it's battery usage",

      "Played it for less than 5 minutes, I got bored fast. With a terrible rig and the horrendous mix of hyper realistic and low poly the graphics look ripped off of some model market. The ground is so extremely vibrant that I could not possibly imagine it being the ocean floor. The basic controls (mobile joystick) and the janky up-down slider were insanely fast and uncomfortable, I couldn't position myself over.a fish- and believe me, I tried. This game is a waste of time, battery, and storage.",

I really hope this app comes with a HUGE improvement, I'll give 5 starsüåü üåü üåü üåü üåü if it does ‚ô• I'll be expecting it.",

      "horrible. there was no instructions on how to get my screen to move like a VR game and all i did was move forward and stare at the ground. nothing i did would move the screen. and my phone doesn't have the options that are posted in everyone else's reviews.",

I think the water and food meter goes down too fast, and it should take longer to make water and to fish. Also, why are there so many sharks?? Inventory should be larger. Overall, it's an addicting game, but it needs some improving",

Tried to find better raft game without bugs. I didn't like them, not simple enough. I like that this game is about basic survival before other gameplay. 3 stars Last edit: still not saving properly. 1 star",
      "Just started and the control for fishing and catching stuff from ocean is not working. Worked for 10 mins and then froze. Working now. Far too difficult to catch fish or to kill sharks. Died umpteen times. No time or patience to wait for this game to kick start. My previous ocean nomad game was much better until progress stuck at level 32. Disappointed I have to say.",

      "Won't finish opening game so I can play. Times out. Send problem to support. I don't get any answer.",
      "Used to be a great game. But now with all the mergers and the big ego's of all the lvl 30 coiners its pretty much impossible to play. UNLESS you pay. Constantly needing to stay bubbled due to the attack/defense imbalance. You cannot defend against a full rally unless you spend money, and even then it quite often ends in disaster. The cannons being disabled was a dumb move. New players get farmed non stop. Have pretty much given up. Server mergers are not always the answer",
      "This game was great until who ever develop this game started to eff up bad costumer service",
      "will this is the third time I have played this game but I didn't stop playing because of coiners i had thing i had to deal with and if you're crying about the coiners I'm not one of them never have never will but that's part of the game if you don't like it don't play it"

      "Also this app will let me play the game and when I clicked on the submarine to feed the fish for 48 hours it took my 36 diamonds and still did not show up and I lost those diamonds. I tried it a second time and again lost 36 diamonds. I would like to be reimbursed my 72 diamonds that I have lost. It's finally working nowbut again I want to be reimbursed for the Lost diamonds or I will uninstall. I also paid$10,000 for a globefish which I never got. I spun wheel,won clownfish & didn't receive.",
      "Very interesting game not to hard to play very challenging.",
      "Its a good game, but why the hell do u need the internet to access the fish tank. I was looking forward to that just to find out i cant do anything as ive no internet or mobile data. Can this be fixed to allow players to access the fish tank offline.",

N the lives last longer than any game I've played before. Who is good....longer lasting lives makes it more interesting and addictive and don't want to put down... great job.... just add more lives and it'll be the best game I've played.... thank u....keep up the great job....",
      "I like this game, ive been playing it for a couple years now, and have pushed it to level 320, ut i have a couple complaints.. It tries way too hard to get me to spend its stupid coins.. The prices on things are ridiculous too.. 9 coins for some more moves? Yeah right! Buy lives? Hellno. I can wait. Also, its aimed at \"kids\", can i get a version that says \"level complete\" instead of \"You Win!\"? I feel stupid playing it, but i am hooked on it. C'est la vie.",

But if you have ADHD the wouldn't it be a good.",

      "This app is really good. People should totally install Mermaid Craft. You don't have to pay, you don't need Wi-Fi, it's a girly crafting game, what else can a girl wish for! I love the skins if a boy wants to play there is also boy skins. It's not to girly for boys there is also other mermaids and mermen, the blocks are amazing, when I unlocked all of them I couldn't decide which one to use. And others info there's another game just like this called Fashion Craft.",
      "Great game, lots of fun, but can't choose fin colors. Supposed to be able to change look.",

      "Cant use the bed. I tried to put some roof, lights, walls and everything i thought that its necessary inorder for the bed to function. I tried switching off the lights hoping that it would work but it didn't please fix that. The nighstand also I think is buged because it function just like the chest I tried putting some lamp because as the name implies \"night stand\" it just stored it and it didn't do a thing. Please fix that. And also try putting some building mode so that it's easier to adjust the chairs, plants, trees, everything. Add also some island for exploring. Thanks."

      "I love this live wallpaper! I reside very close the beach- 6 months out of the year. Now, for the times when I'm too far to see the ocean, it's just a phone screen away.  Also, a big conversation starter. Each time someone notices my phone, they immediately ask \"where did I get that live wallpaper?\"  I've referred 5 people,  in the past 3 days. Great job to the creative creator!!",

      "üòç it after trying so many. First time I paid for an app. But deserves to be paid for. It is a pleasure to open and have a sense of calm. For those that complain about no sound, sound added will chew your battery and less extra sound in my life I welcome. And those complaining about a loop, let me bang my head, a short video has to stop and loop sometime. This is a good smooth loop. Only suggestion I recommend would have been nice to have a setting to set the lighting strength, would have liked it slightly darker",
      "It's beautiful! What kind of people complain about ads, bad looping, use bad language, etc.. YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE! If you have issues with it, then go to the ocean yourself, take the video, and upload it yourself...sound and all! I think this was done beautifully! THANK YOU to the those that worked so hard on this in order to relieve a little stress in the lives of hard-working people, instead of those always EXPECTING and think they deserve a free handout. Much appreciated!!"
