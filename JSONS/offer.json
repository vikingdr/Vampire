      "Update: app sucks. When not let me in and keeps giving me an error code. So tired of this inconsistency and being locked out. SNAP!! it locks you out of your messages and then asks you to register as if you don't have an account. I've only been using this for about six months and it's already happened three times. Can't reply to people's messages. Missed sales. very frustrating. Not sure why they aren't fixing this problem because according to other people it's been going on a long time",
      "No support on bugs at all. I do not get audio notifications for items I'm selling. example: a person messages me wanting to buy an item, I see it FOUR HOURS later. response .metrics/times are way up to an hour because of this bug. could have lost the sale and look like a clown for not responding when OFFERUP NEVER NOTIFIED ME. What's up guys? This sucks. Update: There literally is NO support. Just random comments trying to look like they are actively doing something. they definitely aren't",
      "The app works well for the most part and does have some consistently great deals. After their last update I had to reinstall the app in order to do a new post, which has me a bit concerned on their regression testing process. Just an annoyance, I would still recommend folks trying it out.",
      "Seems like it could have been a good marketplace with good deals but you can't actually buy anything. Sellers just never respond to even full price offers or worse accept then cancel the sale. Days or even weeks wasted. Unreliable or inactive sellers/listings need to be removed. Too frustrating as is, uninstalled.",
      "OfferUp used to be so good. Now it's riddled with bugs, scams, and overall just a terrible experience. For the past year I've been unable to post from mobile data and now I can't log in. No way to contact support, not that they do anything anyway. Time to ditch OfferUp and find a better app to sell on."

      "The old version is way better than the new version because the old app was simple and easy to follow and you can see everything on the page together. The new version has too much information that you don't need scattered in-between too many pop-ups and if you don't know to keep strolling down you will miss the other items the seller is selling and they loose out. Go back to the last version. This version doesn't make sense.",
      "Great app. The distance setting in the search filter was a little off. Like I tried putting in items up to 30 miles away but it had some stuff in there that was to me like 40-50 miles away. It seemed better when I narrowed it closer to my location though. That's the only issue I've experienced with it. The process to post what you want to sell is NOT overly complicated, it's simple to use, but it's kind odd looking for me though. But that's just my opinion there, everything else seems great.",
      "I've had great success with this app, my only complaint is regarding the ads. I do understand to keep this app 100% you need to show ads but I find them to be repetative, rather intrusive and very large. If you don't know to keep scrolling once you see a large ad then you will miss out on a lot things for sale.",
      "It's a great way to make extra money. It's fun to meet with all the interesting people however there are a few flaws to the game. For instance, it is a turn off when a person promises to purchase and they give a date and time then they never show up! Its It's frustrating, and a waste of time I wish that LETGO could implement some kind of consequence for the people that stand people doing things",
      "This is a platform that works and is built well. However the app still has many bugs. They're mostly annoying, some are a little inconvenient. None of them inhibit use of the platform though. They've got a ways to go, and are founded on solid ground. Personalized recommended searches must be based on nothing, because I get recommendations for electronics but all I search for a bit are clothes. Notifications to my phone duplicate themselves, lag, and are sometimes broken."

      "Taking advantage of Coronavirus to make money by featuring upcharged health products. The virus toll counter is also updated slowly, as there have been way more confirmed cases than it says. I used to like this app, but I never thought it would get this scummy.",
      "Ive always enjoyed this app but i dont think they push the sale of local items that much i think they are more concered with the auctions and the Dash section. Ive bought 2 items with both arriving broken and yes they refunded my money but wouldnt send another one to replace it nor any compensation for the trouble it caused me both times. It makes me think i shouldnt buy from dash anymore you cant contact the seller individually. I do like the point system though so 5 stars it is for now",
      "App has changed so much, it's just not the same. Pitiful views, no boost option except with coin rewards which are just a waste of time to complete, and why is this app using over 1G of my storage space? That's un heard of. The Dash feature needs to be monitored unless this is no longer a family friendly app, I mean items range from crotchless lingerie to bondage looking items and barely nude models showcasing these? Seriously guys, not family friendly at all",
      "find anything you need on this app at awesome prices!!! EDITED: I live in the United States but for some reason when I try to share the link to friends or share the app for them to download, it says \"sorry this is not available in your country\" ??? So exactly what countries actually get the rewards for sharing the app with their friends? I will change my review back to 5 stars when I get a good reason for this. Other than is issue, I have loved the app so please let me know why.",
      "Better than other apps, but still needs work. I miss the shipping feature since it helped me get some cool stuff not usually found local. That should still be up to the seller though. The coins feel gimmicky, and kinda more annoying than fun. Still need to not be able to rate literally anyone you have a conversation with ( black mirror anyone?) And as for \"removing inappropriate ratings\", still have it on there after 4 yrs, but removed their's."

      "I was given the option of limiting my search to distance. I entered within 30 miles. But was shown items as far away as Arizona! The developer needs a spanking...",
      "I have a Google pixel 2 and my problem with this app is that it doesn't let me take any pictures and also it doesn't show any pictures from the gallery (even though I provided permission four camera). Basically at this moment I cannot do anyting. 😢 Hope you will be able to fix it ASAP!!!!!!",
      "I like the layout but setting a location should be easier like offerup just enter a zip code and stop adding all these additional steps. More views than 5 mile but still needs work. Posting items is a pain because just like entering your location there's way too many steps involved to select a photo and post your item. Why are you guys making everything so complicated? Simplify it. Could be good but programmers insist on making the design complicated with extra steps at every turn. So dumb guys."

      "Great app, depending on what you're looking for, you could find a lot of cool and/or quality products. Theres plenty of things I've seen that would've been perfect for me, if only I had more space, like an extra room for an pool table or piano. Theres also other useful things, like lumber, fencing posts, bricks, and plenty of other building materials, that if I knew how, I could've used also.",
      "I like the thought and execution of this app. People tend to remove listings quickly and not let them hang around once someone takes the posted item. Some people will not like the large amount of notiffications. I appreciate it actually. When I moved I had nothing to move in with. Only took a few days to have all the stuff I needed to live confortably.",
      "Ive only had one problem with the app so far. There was 2 ads with the same picture, but couldn't find either one following Google map. Good thing you can message the people who are giving the stuff away and was able to meet up with them later on. When I did meet with them the location was nowhere near where Google map was directing me to.",
      "I love this app. I get to see what is posted for free the MOMENT it's posted on one of the four sites like craigslist or letgo. Yes you can simply go to Craigslist and check the free section.. BUT! With free stuff alerts it notifies you immediately all in one spot instead of having to go searching it's brought right to you. Very cool and very fun.",
      "Amazing app. I've gotten sooo much stuff it's literally saved me thousands. I got enough fence to go around my entire yard, peg board to organize my tools and garage. 150 cinder blocks to build a burn pit and benches. Sherwin Williams paint! It goes on and on and on. Honestly best app ever in my mind!!!!"

Much cheaper than regular prices on most items. 2. Current on fads/trends. 3. Can keep items in cart for desired time frame. Cons: 1. Some require many extra steps being time consuming & confusing. 2. Shipping takes FOREVER! 3. Stock usually low or sold out. SITE- HORRIBLE Customer service",
      "Definitely worth to save money on things you'd like to do. Especially sales for going out to eat or entertainment. Also, some sales are insanely good. A local MMA gym had a month's worth of class for $13... Most gyms cost $300. This app is also good if you want to try new things, but are reluctant to spend a huge amount on something you may not like.",
      "I really enjoy using groupon but trying to talk to someone about an issue is nearly impossible, to chat with a person is very disappointing, I feel as I am being rushed and nothing get accomplished, this is very frustrating. I accidentally purchased 2 of the same deal and was trying to let someone know about the issue and was told it was refunded but I do not see where it has been and now trying to find out more info on the situation has become very stressful",
      "Been using for years with mostly good experiences. Bought a few deals before coronavirus and customer service helped me to get groupon bucks so the deals wouldnt go to waste during the outbreak. Customer service very accommodating. I only wish more places would offer a groupon, seems to be the same few local places for months and months.",
      "Its a good app, has some bargains but could do with combining some postage charges. Have had to return a couple of clothes items but groupon sort problems out almost on the spot and i've bought lots of goods with no problems at all. All in all, great!"

The only hang up here, may be the lack of members in some areas, but this won't last long. The statistics are available to see yourself, Swapit is growing fast! Join now, share and promote!",

Someone even posted photos of a break in point of their neighbours house. Don't use it or your safety will be compromised when you post. Also they get paid from the illegal earnings every time someone pays through the app. This app is run by criminals. Do not get it!"

This is obviously not the apps fault , but ads are flagged and removed seconds after you post them. No reason at all. And support is a hoot. They put in sarcastic morons as forum help to berate people for having the audacity to figure out a problem. What utter stupidity. No wonder other selling platforms have surpassed them. They need new management overhaul or risk going obsolete",

Please add an option where you can search nationwide instead of having to check boxes of location. Overall, it kinda gets the job done, could definitely be better.",

      "i love the idea of allgoods but the app itself does not have the best layout for ease of use. the categorys of items are too specific that it seems like there are no used goods within a 10k radius unless i dont search in any specific category. i have to either click through all the overly specific categorys most of which have no goods or scroll through everything thats listed at once. are there other filters for search? latest/lowest $ etc if so i cant find em. i'm 29yo in chch for reference.",
      "This is a game changer for New Zealanders buying and selling online. Love that you can sell for free and can chat with the sellers easily. Can't believe people are still using Trademe now that I've found this. The APP works beautifully and I save so much time listing things to sell. Definitely will be my number one go to from now on.",
      "Its good but not great. Lots of bug issues noted and only downloaded today. Unable to get app to recognise my location settings are on so therefore cannot list anything or see local listings. When you go to take a step back it bounces you right back to the home screen thus having to restart search again. When trying to list things it comes up with Rover/118 or some other number only for auto search catergory only way to actually get catergory is manually doing it.",
      "So far i I love it, my only complaint would be that there seems to be quite a lag on it. I have to close and go back in and it works fast for like 3min then the lag kicks in again. It's the only app I have that does that. My phone is Samsung Note 8. Otherwise it's great. Super easy layout.",
      "So far loves it, they took some of the best ideas from other popular platforms and make it super easy to use. The only complaints probably be the limited stocks, but it's still on its early days. And it's free, what more do you expect!"

      "Gotten neat stuff since I started using! Can sell for free shipping and get for free shipping if wanted. Shipping protected with tracking is safer for both, but sometimes cost more. Can earn free XNK for spending, sometimes difficult to accumulate, sometimes is easier. Different experiences, depends who you ask, plus sometimes users have a bidding app. that can be used to bid for them.",
      "Great app. Love how easy and fun it is to list and bid. One change i do not like is not able to buy XNK like before with the credits. Prices are going up ever since the new XNK came out and no way would a new member have enough to even win an auction. Some just prefer to buy than to list for credits. Also, im not sure if its the app or my phone but i have a Note 8 and when i try to list photos they rotate automatically even if i took the photos straight. Please add edit for photos.",

      "Useful and fairly intuitive. Would be nice if it auto-deleted Expired clipped items (you can delete it manually) or gave you the option to configure it to do so. Some flyers are more well-suited than others -- from the big chains, generally relatively easy to clip and see. For some places though where the flyers are broad-sheet sized, products shown are miniscule -- so it's hard to see a product, let alone clip it. Not sure if there's anything Flipp can do about that. Zooming in is really painful and not really worth the time.",
      "This app is exceptional!!! I love love love this app you can't go wrong by downloading this app you'll have the sales ads at the tip of your fingers on your phone all day every day! I'm in love with the 'LIST' section you add what you need to buy and the app will pull up all the sales at all the nearby stores in your area! DON'T DELAY DOWNLOAD TODAY!!!",
      "This is a really great app. Super convenient. I love being able to put my loyalty cards in it too, but am holding back one star because there isn't a way to add a card unless the store is already in their loyalty list. So I have cards from smaller retailers that I have to still carry.",
      "While scrolling through the flyers, tapping on certain items, the page would not display clearly. A different display of another item would appear. When I try to correct the problem, the entire page would be unclear. Basically it would show a collage of ads. I prefer looking through the (old fashioned) paper flyer.",
      "Aside from the convenience of every flyer at your fingertips, I absolutely love the search feature. If I have to buy an item on a tight budget any given week, it's great knowing that I can compare all the local ads for it and buy where its the best price!"

No response back from them..",

      "I love this app, find it useful for finding great local deals! It would be better if the messages showed up right away instead of only when the page is physically refreshed or restarted, and if the search engine would have filters, search within price range etc. Still would reccomend to friends though.",
      "Nice to have a place to buy good used items. But it's very frustrating if you forget your password login. I did and clicked to send email to reset several times and didn't get email to reset. I finally figured out my password on my own. Now I have no notifications updating on the app. Nothing new showing in the last 24 hours?!",

      "Great app. Great concept. Just wish there was a search option without having to buy something first so I don't have to wade through things I have no interest in.",
      "I love this app, and I understand the point is to outbid people, but I find it hard to take items from other's. I have found that if you set reminders the app will let you know when you can bid again. If you miss the bidding opportunity, they usually offer you the item at a base amount. That amount is usually less than what you would have bid, so for that reason if something is going twice I try not to take items from other's. My time always comes around. Common courtesy goes a long way. JS",
      "Fun and exciting app, unfortunately most everything (ALL) comes from CHINA. I found even if it says USA it ships from overseas 😥. I also found the app locks till you pay for item won so you can't bid on anything else. App is slow to show details of item, also what you see in the picture is not always what you get so read the details first. Clothes are Chinese sizes so if your a size 16 /18 Us that's a 5x large or xxxxxL becareful on this site.",
      "Fun (free to bid) Pay if you win Auction Site. New stuff daily. Auctions start every 90 seconds. all kinds of items from electronics, jewelry, home and hobby, premium, fashion and beauty. Lots of surprise items. You won't be sorry you checked it out. UPDATE 2/26/20 it's a 50/50 chance of getting exactly what was pictured, described, and expected. Most items are on eBay. All items have multiples. While fun, 90 sec is not enough time to read full desc & bid. Buy it now $ are 2 High. C eBay",
      "I am so, so, waaaaaay to app!!!!! Sometimes you have to wait a bit for the shipping time cuz a lot of stuff comes from. I have bought about 12 rings or so and a tennis bracelet as well and they are all so gorgeous!! I have told my family and all my friends about this app and to use it because you really can get great deals from here. They are easy to refund your money if you are not satisfied or change your mind. so be careful when you download and start bidding cuz you will get addicted quick"

      "Love this app. Shopping and selling items are easy. Only negative I've experienced is that They are overly aggressive on monitoring every aspect of communication between the seller and buyer, so just keep that in mind. Also when you first start off selling, be aware that you must figure out your exact shipping costs before you price an item. I offered to sell a baby doll bed for $10 and was told by USPS that it would cost $99 to ship to the other side of country due to the dimensions of the box.",
      "I really like Mercari for selling stuff! It's easy to use. I've sold two things so far, but my issue is that my listings dont show up when I go to my profile and click the Selling tab on the app... It's annoying because I get the \"Action Required\" notification but it takes me to a page where it says I have no listing and no in-progress sales. I have to go on my computer to look at my listings. I really hope this gets fixed.",
      "Love this app. I have a lot of makeup and clothes I'm not going to use so this app is awesome for selling those kind of things and everything really! I've sold all sorts of items. Never had an issue with receiving my funds. In my experience mercari has been great with handling any issues I've had as a buyer and seller. Love the changes they've made to the app but there still are some things that could improve.",
      "3/21/20 Update: The app, on any device, will not load my messages and this has been going on for almost 2 months. I've been using the app for 3 years now, and it is kind of ridiculous that my messages won't load on any device. I am an IT specialist, and have gone through every known protocol. Have reinstalled numerous times, reset and tried diff connections (data/wifi/etc), and reset device settings. Seems as of you are intentionally disallowing my messages to be opened. Please resolve this.",
      "Great as a buyer, ok as a seller. Mercari tries to get you to price things as low as possible. They also automatically have a feature turned on that lowers the price with views. So your item will Bottom out fast. So as a buyer you are getting awesome deals but it's not as great as a seller. Also the $2 fee to cash out is a bit ridiculous in this day and age. I already paid a fee on what I was paid for the item and now I have to pay again to have MY money."

      "Great app, been using since 2012-ish, and they have made major & minor tweaks along the way, but most recently I've found it difficult to physically create new listings, even with the help of Posh tech support; they definitely raised shipping prices, you can't make an offer to likers without also choosing to pay 1 of 2 shipping costs, so you can't make offer on items +/=$6 or it results in negative payment; & lastly, charging buyers tax on items I'd already paid taxes on in the past. Double dip.",
      "I love this app. Genius!!! Everyone on this site seem to be a higher caliber than other sites. My questions about items are always promptly answered, the items are in great shape. The coolest thing is being able to find things from your past (example: Vision streetwear clothing). or discontinued colors for fav make up items. Literally bought my wedding dress on poshmark. Awesome site. Great app!",
      "I love this app. But unfortunately I messed up and I inadvertently deleted it by mistake when trying to delete an unused app. I realized what I did, and reloaded the app. Now I lost my likes in my profile area even though other things are kept and the teck is screwing with me. It won' let me do anything. I can't comment, ask questions or reach out to anyone. I have a credit with Posh, and everything. Help I'm having major problems, and I wanted to buy something too? Now what do I do?",
      "Need better sales reports to include transfers. App has been sharing extremely slower than normal lately. For days, if not weeks now! Can you please add a sort feature for shared last and oldest listings? It would help when there are these issues with sharing. Would make sharing and updating older inventory a whole lot easier and less daunting for larger closets when you have to scroll all the way to bottom over and over. Also, adding photos all at once would be nice as in other apps. Thanks!",
      "App works perfectly for buying and selling, no issues there. However, when asked to go through reported items & review them, after I make and select a decision, and it moves on to the next reported item, the app still shows the previous reported item and its info, but the bottom part changes. The only way to get to the next reported item is to back completely out back to notifications screen, otherwise it will continue to only show that first reported item."

      "The app works fine for me. Haven't had any issues. However, I would rate it higher and probably use it more often if there wasn't the ridiculously annoying blank notifications that come up about every 3-5 minutes that won't let you clear them, you can only minimize. I can place an order and for the rest of the day periodically get these black notifications. I'd rather just wait to order till I get to the restaurant.",
      "The app works fine but there needs to be a lot of improvements. In order to use a offer, have to manually put everything listed in the offer exact word for word. Would be better to click only once. When you pay for it, took me about 5 minutes to figure out how. When you click pay, there's 3 words like \"add card and Wendys digital pay\" all clumped together. Later found out they were choices. Should be some button layout. It looks like just 1 big button instead of 3 seperate button choices.",
      "Using the app is easy and mobile ordering is great however when you change or add condiments they are completely ignored. For example I asked for no mayo due to an allergy but for extra ketchup and pickles. I received my Baconator with more mayo than anything, barely a teaspoon of ketchup and no pickles very disappointed. I did not have time to go back thru the drive thru to have them correct my order since I am only allowed a 30 minute lunch break and already had used 15 minutes.",
      "App was working fine around the new breakfast launch time. Now I can't even place an order. Always gives me an error about credit card info when i've been using the same card ever since, no changes. Tried multiple cards and got the same error. There needs to be a better tender system otherwise app is useless. Uninstalling until fix. Still love the grub though😘",
      "The app is poorly designed and crashes often. Placing orders is a really frustrating experience as it often runs into a problem, but doesn't tell you what the issue is. DO NOT ADD GIFT CARDS TO THE APP. This will completely transfer the balance of the card to the app. If your gift card has less than the value of your order, you cannot spend the balance of the gift card. And you cannot remove the gift card from the app to use the physical gift card again. Wendy's needs to figure out a way where gift cards can spend their remaining balance on a card and charge the rest to a credit card. The only decent thing about the app is that they have some decent coupons on there that I like to use often."

    "description":"Cheap Cars Finder APP is a search platform developed to help people with low budget to find affordable used cars, trucks, SUVs, pickups, and minivans for sale in USA near they live.\r\n\r\nOver 1-MILLION downloads...! Thank you! =D\r\n\r\nIf you’re selling cars at a low price, i.e. under $1000, $2000 or for less than $5000, feel free to post FREE CLASSIFIED ADS for an unlimited time. Process is pretty easy, on just one page and previous sign up isn’t required. Only requisite is one photo of the car and your ad will be automatically approved. Dealerships welcome.\r\n\r\nCAR FINDERS\r\nWhat you need to know before using the app\r\n\r\nReal cheap cars? 1st thing you need to know is that app doesn’t do miracles. If you’re searching for used cars in \"like-new\" condition for $5000 or less and 1-3 years old, this isn’t the app to find them.\r\n\r\nApp's purpose is helping users to find used cars from $1000 up to $5000, which is our price range for cheap cars, but please, keep in mind that some cars at these prices may need some work, have normal wear or high mileage, even though, we can assure that, according to their sellers, many of them run well and for some that’s enough.\r\n\r\nAlso, although APP encourages sellers to post cars for sale on this price range, it isn't mandatory or forced. Keep also in mind that CHEAP is an ambiguous/subjective word that relies on the budget and overall condition of the car, having the last word, a personal test drive and inspection, things that APP hasn’t a way to do by itself.\r\n\r\nAPP requests to sellers to post as much as they can detailed information about the overall condition of cars so buyers may have an idea if it worth the price or not, but again, a personal test drive will have the last word. Never pay money for a car you haven’t tested/checked by yourself first. You can also always contact the seller to request more information which is the correct way to start the negotiation.\r\n\r\nLow inventory.  APP isn’t a Silicon Valley-funded and service is totally FREE, so budget to market it across the country is limited. Some users complain about the low inventory and we understand and apologize about it, so please, give it some time, we're trying as much as we can to make it known and discoverable. APP doesn’t use automatic data feeds provided by street dealerships and their marketing networks which is the way bigger car finder apps work to provide millions of listings. Cheap Cars Finder APP relies more on used cars posted by their owners, at lower or cheaper prices that dealers may not be able to offer. \r\n\r\nJust give it a try, if you find something you like it, awesome! but if you don’t, you can try another site/APP, that’s how searching online works. Whining, retaliating or leaving a negative review, doesn’t help at all.\r\n\r\nOutdated ads. A common issue among sellers is they forget to remove their cars once they’re sold given that APP allows to list them for unlimited time (some fixer-upper cars needs more than the usual time to get sold), so that’s why we do really appreciate that you use the [REPORT AD] option in case you find a sold car instead of leaving a negative review. Reporting helps more.\r\n\r\nAPP FEATURES\r\n\r\n♣ Find cheap cars by zip code (distance), make & model, body style, USA state or price range\r\n♣ Post and manage multiple used cars on same account\r\n♣ Sort search results by distance, price, year, mileage, model, etc\r\n♣ Receive instant notifications sent by possible buyers\r\n♣ Dark layout good for your eyes and phone battery life\r\n♣ Expandable images (zoom-in-out)\r\n♣ Seller tools to check stats, edit profile, remove/edit ads, etc\r\n♣ Share best deals with friends\r\n\r\nAutopten.com © 2007-2019\r\nhttp://www.autopten.com\r\n\r\nObjective and constructive reviews are welcome and appreciated.\r\n\r\nJoin our social channels of over 100K car sellers and buyers:\r\n\r\nFB:\r\nhttps://facebook.com/cheapcarsunder1000/\r\nhttps://facebook.com/cheapcarsunder2000/\r\nhttps://facebook.com/cheapcarsforsale/",

      "I thought the app was great. It simplified basic free donations or gifted. I actually got a very nice bedroom set recently from a family that was THE BEST!!!!! I have checked on and off for quite awhile out of curiosity and boredom. I just checked in on the app and it's completely different. Some good changes. But!!!! I am coming up completely blank for my area???? But other areas of the state are there. The positive changes seem so much easier. I do hope I didn't get blocked out for something??? Thanks to all the super nice people that still have the manner of my \"Bedroom Set\" donation fam. TY H&J....You helped alot!",
      "The app is just a forward of all the free stuff listed on Craigslist, and this app isnt as user friendly as the craigslist app. Now if they were some how able to combine every free listing from every app, then this app might be worth the trouble, but unless this happens...dont waste your time",
      "great concept but it keeps giving me an error and stopping app... everytime I open an ad, it says app stopped.. I have to go back out and click on the app again.. please fix this.. this is a great idea.ive uninstalled and reinstalled.... still doing the same thing",
      "im debating back and forth whether or not to load app. after reading the reviews a lot of people have said its just Craigslist which i loathe thst site. Beracah id like to hear more from you of why ur app is great and worth loading. also i will load it and search it on the grounds that you can find ppl in Northwest Indiana/Chicagoland area of ppl advertising free items. if u can answer any of my questions or regards i might be sueded to check it out and use the app. and give you a bettet review",

I tried saying something in the feedback withing the app but i couldn't do that because I'm not certified and it just asked me to verify my email (send another verification email to use this feature). I can't... Is really like to use it but I'm stuck..☹️ Any help would be appreciated.",

      "I like this app however missing sorting options(price or discount), group or filter to apps or games (if it is an option to do), discount tab shows 100% free ones as well which have separate tab. However still a better browsing experience than play store. Yes I found the filter on main tab which is pretty handy but it is far from ideal. Still a great app though.",
      "I would like to have the option to receive notifications only about true free apps and games, and filter them for the most stared ones as well as the option to sort the apps by stars and by original price in order to filter the junk, unuseful apps. Noticed that not all of the apps on Google's Play store are searchable. Also, an AMOLED theme can never harm an app. I will update the review as soon as these crutial features get their way to the app and when you reply to me so I notice.",
      "One of those very useful software applications in the apps store . I use it every day and it's quite addictive. I like the way you place your ads. Non obtrusive ethically placed ads. Now I'm using my phone like a Pro.!",

      "No any bug fixed from this worst App. Still the condition gone worst as it was 2 Years & 5 Months ago. Really Frustrated with this WORST APP. It doesn't deserves any Single STAR but it's need to Comment. Now Not a SINGLE SURVEY is available. It still needs a big bug to be fixed. As Representative asked me to Reset Google's Ad's setting as I did but still not a single survey is available.",
      "I recently used this app to recharge and after several attempts could not do it. Why the recharge failed I don't know. The amount has been deducted and has been credited as recharge points. I've sent a mail asking for the amount to be returned but no luck. Replying to your post:- I have sent a mail with details from the mail sent to me. It's 3-4 days now. I tried recharging with the points but the only message is 'failed'. What is the reason for the failure to recharge?",
      "App looking bulky please make a smooth effect and add comparision plan between other operator this was making you so famous Comparision technique is based on only data , only calling , per date etc this was making your app more useful and we get a best offer and found better operator and also service provider is paid you to promote their recharge plan And then monopoly of single operator is reduced",
      "App is Great but never Do Surveys on it, as you never get paid that PROMISED amount. Recently, open app and One Pop-Up appeared showing A ₹30Bucks of Paytm reward for the Survey. I did it with honesty and Oh boy the survey asked alotta questions but while it finally got ended, a message popped up stating \"You're not eligible to get this amount, as per provider criteria\" something like that. I mean, that is completely fraud and wasting my time. Something like that wasn't even mentioned in T&C.",
      "Be care from this app while recharging to mobile plans, if recharge failed then your money after deduction go in recharge point which can not get back easily."

There is also a lot of free stuff that someone can use. Very generous people are kind enough to share their stuff with others. Thank you",
      "This app sucks, great idea but my dog can write an app better than this. Its glitchy, filter options blow most of the options don't make sense for what the app is but great premise.. Needs to let someone who knows how make/maintain an app like this take over. Then I can see this app being huge, like life changing awe well, pity.",
      "It's fun seeing what folks are giving away or what they are looking for. Y'all out there, hope you find whatever it is you are looking for! And be kind to one another. It is so easy to do and if do find you're around people who you object to, just stay away from them, that's even easier! Have a great day!!!!",
      "I like seeing what folks are willing to share. Because the CPRO app screens MY activity on it, I'm comfortable that other posters are monitored as well. Thats important in contrast to other methods of online trading It's also easy to use, which for an 80 yr old is a factor.",
      "Im new to the app, I've only had it for a few weeks. The only thing ive found negative I guess, the area it list for is hundreds of miles across, thousands of square miles. It would be helpful to narrow it down my cities with ther option to search outside your area. Just a thought."

Over and above making me wait months to even award me the £20 gift card the offer gave if you spent £180+ on theatre tickets every time I clicked on the button to redeem it the app would not let me claim my £20 Amazon reward card (it always failed conveniently) whenever I tried to claim it until it expired. The app is not worth your time and effort frankly. Other reward companies such as swagbucks would be a better use of your time.",

      "Before you download this app be aware that the extent to which they will pass along, and the liberties they will take with your private info borders on incredible. READ THE T&A, PRIVACY POLICY. If that's not enough, the app size listed in the \"about\" readme is about 18mb. The actual size of the install is almost 100mb. Just so you know. I'm certain there are plenty of alternatives out there and - I'm outta here!",
      "I use this app for sharing/seeking recommendations and commenting on local issues. Also for advertising community events. The ambience of discussion is friendly and helpful. Occasional techy exchange of views, but the only aggressive 'troll' I have read seemed to get cut out fairly quickly. There is some monitoring , both automated (warning if you use a sweary word) and I think real time person monitoring. So it is a useful social media platform. Advertising keeps it going - not too intrusive.",
      "A great idea and easy to use but it's only as good as the people who use it. I hope that it will not become another medium for people to promote their business and selling stuff. There are apps for that and Facebook has plenty. I appeal to people to avoid this and use it for the things that connect us rather than as a monetizing tool!",
      "I find it helpful for getting people to do work around my house using other folks recommendations and I give mine too. The notifications about crime are also great and folks are aware of what's going on in their neighborhood. I appreciate the sheriff's dept alerts, too. Great all around app.",
      "I haven't had this app long, but it does provide helpful local information. It is rather confusing but that should get better with use. Especially now, people are posting good information related to coronavirus resources, help for those needing assistance, and even a central Mid-Hudson Valley group who's mission it is to connect people needing help with those who can offer it."

      "Needs work. I'm giving the eBay app three stars because basically it does what it should, although it does need quite a bit more tweaking to function better. Unfortunately the issues that I have experienced relate to the everyday functionality of it. It is very glitchy and does need seemingly constant babysitting to ensure that it is doing everything you want it to and that it is not just deciding to do certain things for you. Use with caution.",
      "I downloaded to buy a few things that I saw. I am ultimately unimpressed. Whereas I was excited to buy things from people (who accept my card type) and such, but 90% checking out I would get an alert saying \"could not process payment, change card or try pay pal\". Sometimes it would process the payment, but only one or two items instead of all 10. I just don't understand, the buyers accept my card type, I have the money, I just don't have the patience for all of this. Please fix this",
      "I just installed the last update and it did nothing to correct the small text! I can barely read my messages and the entire app text is very small!!! Still sucks!!! I also don't like the new tracking screen! I used to be able to click on the tracing number and it would take me to the carriers website and with a simple click I could receive shipping updates on my orders! You people screwed that up too! Please put that back the way it was! REMEMBER FOLKS: \"IF IT ISN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!!!\"",
      "The messaging system is glitchy! I can't communicate with sellers as the send arrow only appears about 1/4 the time. It also has trouble loading the messages received so I can read them. Sometimes I have to click back out of the message and then back into it a few times before it decides to load.",
      "Not any better than the previous one, jumping all over the place when doing searches, you request to search by lowest price first and it still hides them between the higher priced items, so taking ages and time consuming to find things I want at affordable prices. I also hate the assumption in every search that there are things I do not want to see in each subject, I want to see all items available not have only the ones chosen by someone else who knows nothing about what I may be looking for?"

      "Pictures of items do not expand past the initial tap. Sometimes I have to take a screen shot and expand picture in my gallery. Other times I just go to another website. There are a lot of retailers out there carrying the same items. Target's prices aren't that great anyway. Although I periodically buy things from Target online, I mostly avoid it.",
      "Right now, the \"offers available\" prompt is very confusing to follow. I searched for a good 30 minutes for the, supposed, \"discount offer\" as a circle member before finally giving up and just placing my order. Target devs, you have a long way to go. Especially considering the fact that you're simply taking advantage of the fear and panic everyone is experiencing at this time in our lives. Please step your game up. We all need you. Be that beacon of hope you promised you'd be.",
      "I love this app! I can shop and add my savings at the end. I have different delivery options that are on the app. This is a great featurewith the store becauseI have a smallchild and I dont always want to get her out of the car if she is asleep. There are also times when I dont want to have to get dressed to go into the store for one item. It is amazing!",
      "I find it frustrating when the app freezes up and has to be closed and reopened frequently. I was unsure about the notations in red indicating a possible delay in that particular item being available.which is certainly understandable under the current conditions. Did that also mean that the current gift card offer might no longer be available as well?",
      "Have been using this for about 2 months now. It does just about everything that I need. Thanks! Update - love this app except for one thing - the search engine needs to be better. Even if you search for one specific item, it will bring back way too many different items. Update 3/11/20- love it, but PLEASE tune the search engine. Brings back way too many non-specific results."

The purpose of me having the app is to check the prices on sale and clearance items before I purchase them, but I can't get it to work. In my opinion, the app has been horrible and a waste of time.",

Auto location for the store you are in would make it better. Still has room for improvement.",

      "Awesome deals...if you can get to them before their gone that is. Helped me with my 1st year baby stuff a ton!! Dont know much about couponing but they make it dummy proof with step my step instructions on every deal and links for everything you need. Love seeing what pops up everyday!! If your not like me and dont like to be bothered as much the notifications are super customizable for your preferences and are always asking to make sure they're set how you like. 5 out of 5 well done ladies",
      "I must say, this app has cleaned up very nicely. This app saves you money on products that people actually use. Unlike other apps that show you circulars to multiple stores. This app cut straight to the Chase and shows you where all the best deals are. I have multiple apps that display coupons but this one is by far the best, I've seen deals that were in other apps that this app displays plus more. In fact this app is so good I have deleted the other apps within this category. Great job",
      "Love the deals posted on this app, the coupon break down & steps are very easy to follow!! Its a must download app to have on your phone especially if you like to save money on your favorite ptoducts and check out the nonadvertisted hidden savings in all your local favorite stores n get in on the hott savings online!! You will be glad that you did!! Also check out the free items!",
      "I check this app several times a day. Not that need to because they send me all of the notifications that I need. I would also like to commend them on how useful and informative they have been regarding Covid-19. Keep up the Awesome job KCL! You are greatly appreciated!!",
      "I Love it! It Keeps you in the Know, Up to Date, has a Variety of everything. Another Fav of mine unlike other Apps, is when deal Expires, it Lets you know so you Dont Waste Your Time. Only Down Fall, is That I DONT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GO AN GET EVERY DEAL!!"

Browse Auctions - All items sold on DealDash are brand new and come with manufacturer warranties. DealDash works directly with leading retailers and brands and sells items from their own or their trusted partners' warehouse stock.\r\n\r\n2. Buy Bids - Bids allow you to participate in the auctions that enable you to save money on best-selling brand name items. You’re can purchase bids in a variety of different pack sizes. Bids can be usually purchased for less than $0.20 each.\r\n\r\n3. Start Bidding - All auctions start at $0.00. Each bid placed adds one penny to the final price of the item.

It's impossible to do a password reset I have a bunch of saved coupons and spins.. Family Dollar won't let me reset my password. The link in the password reset email just goes to the main page. The \"contact us\" link on the password reset email is a broken link as well. I tried calling the 800 number but apparently the line is only open \"bankers hours\". Closed before I leave for work . Already closed when I come home from work. Not open on weekends either. When I do take time off to call, I can't get a hold of a real person.. Just a voicemail system with a mountain of options, but no option of \"app help\". I left messages but no response. I spend a lot of money at Family Dollar since they are the only store within 15 miles from me. If I can't get coupons, I'll just buy my stuff from Amazon..",
      "What a POS. I just tried to sign up and it has so many bugs just trying to key in a password that I'm am deleting it already. No sooner did I try to log in, it told me to change my password. When I sent for the code, it auto filled the code then sent me to the page to key in the new password....only there was no space to create one. I tried 3 times and it just sits there waiting for me to key something in with no space to do so. I'm beyond frustrated.",
      "The app is horrible and almost as crappy as the products they carry. Don't bother downloading this app. Nobody at the stores know anything about it or why it doesn't work. You will spend your time clipping coupons only to find out at the cash register that you didn't fulfill the requirements that were buried 3 screens deep when you clipped it. A HUGE WASTE OF TIME.",
      "Its ok, but only if ur looking for specific items. Wouldnt let me use the 'list' function on the app, the scanner wasnt that great either!"

      "I found and purchased several Items that I can use at fabulous prices. At first I thought that they only carried things I would never use, but I found they have things for everyone. Try hitting the find icon and you will be amazed. Their selection is vast. I found things I need right away and placed an order. Then I searched and found hundreds of things that I want, so after I pay my Bill's I can't wait to come back for more.",
      "Good, just frustrating and time waster at times.You think that you bought an item and then they tell you that you did not get it. Delivery is expensive, but overall a good experience. It doesn't really let you search for what are you looking for, so that is why I give 3 starts, and because of delivery. Quicker to purchase on other sites. Good, because you can see lots of different items if you have the time.",
      "Whenever I try to order my items, the transcation doesn't go through. It either says \"oops, try again\" or \"please contact your credit card..\" I am using a prepaid gift card and nothing is working. Not to mention you guys accept gift cards so what is there that is not going well? I typed in my information correctly and yet, it's still not accepting it. Plus, the prices on the items are off. For example, a shirt will say $7 but when you select your size, the price increases.",
      "It's a good app where you can get things pretty cheap. I wish there was an option to get rid of the items you already have bought on there. It'll pop up on the newsfeed more than once and it gets pretty annoying at times. It would also be great if when you click on something cause you don't know what it is, for that reason alone and not wanting to buy it, that it wouldn't pop up on your newsfeed anymore. That gets annoying real quick cause most of the time I don't want that item.",
      "I really dont know what to say about this app. It has been showing me \"payment pending\"since yesterday even though I have given my complete card details and everything!! It's really disappointing because it's my first purchase with Wish and they are already giving me a very poor service!It really glitches so many times!!!"

      "I really like this app. You have to stay on top of your cash back though because sometimes it misses it. I always double check after i place an order though so it's not so bad. I am upset they removed Wal-Mart and Amazon from this app because those were the two i used the most. I hope they put them back!",
      "Waste of time. It takes weeks for cash back to be added to your account...if you are credited at all. When you submit an inquiry to see where your cashback dollars are (which is a challenge of its own), you get error messages and can't complete the process. Rakuten, If 0% back on a $500 purchase from Amazon was the special offer, you nailed it. Don't waste your time or data.",
      "Have been using this app for a while (when it was ebates). Love that you get cash back on purchases, however for EVERY Amazon purchase, you have to manually add your purchases.. It's ALWAYS been like this. The missing cash back is quickly added to my account when submitted,, but it's just annoying because I do almost half of my online shopping on Amazon.",
      "Bad for In-Store shopping. This app is more online based, connecting your online shopping accounts and purchases in order to give you cash back. This app also only allows one bank account to be connected, which isn't very flexible for a family. Also, if you want to take pictures of your receipts and your family's receipts, this app is not for you. There is no \"receipt picture taking\" option since this app is more focused on providing coupons while you shop online; then gives u cash back online.",
      "So far so good, there is a few months in between pay periods but at least you have a chance to build up your funds towards a refund check or PayPal. U receive a small% back from shopping, while using this app before you buy. And i love that you can choose from sooo many different stores to shop at. Thank you rakuten(Ebates) app."

Like its blank. No options to reload page or whatever. Idk if its a singular issue or if others are having this sort of problem.",
      "I love the apps just don't understand why they would take away the Love List! Now if I find something I love but don't want to purchase with my current transaction I have to completely take it out of my cart and try to relocate the item again after I have made my purchase so that I don't lose track of it. How on Earth are you supposed to keep track of the items thought you loved if there is no place to store your favorites? I can deal with every glitch or app issue but that one so that would be my highest recommended problem to address with this app. With this being a billion dollar clothing\\lingerie industry with both of their apps being out for years now I don't understand why they haven't been updated with a list for you to store your favorite items just like the website. I'm kinda shocked at that issue.. 🤔",
      "Terrible experience! There always seems to be an issue. I contact customer service online and over the phone and they dont know how to solve the issue. Very inconvenient. I have the Angel credit card, which I make sure to pay on time every month. But, if I cannot use it then it's not worth having it.",

      "Previously I would have given 5 stars, because I could save my favorites with all the custom toppings for easy reordering. Being able to just walk in and pick up was awesome. But in the last week or two, it has been completely unusable. It starts to open, and then just freezes at a black screen. It's not my phone, as other apps are working great. If they fix this, I will update my review.",
      "3-21-20 The app opens to black screen and never goes any farther than that then the app crashes. Please fix this. Before the last update the app would open but it would take an incredibly long time to load anything when I tapped on it. Then it got to the point that it would just sit there and the loading icon would spin endlessly. After the update my app won't load at all, I just keep getting an error message over and over and over until I close the app.",
      "Now the shortcut to the app is gone from my LG phone. I can use the app from the PlayStore but it says it is only for iphone or ipad. Pretty good so far. Only issue is mixed up drive-thru or at the register. They don't check both places, they just say they never got the order. Got charged twice and never got the refund. Issues, but the app is easy to use & looks good.",
      "Had this app installed on my phone for months with little to no issue. Tried to open it today and I got a black screen and it wouldnt load. I uninstalled it then reinstalled. I was able to get it to load but now I'm having an issue where I can't customize my drink. I can't even select a drink. This is frustrating. App needs work.",
      "I enjoy taco bell, but this app needs some love. After this most recent update that \"fixes bugs\" now there are others. Every time I try to swap my medium drink on the new combo literally nothing happens. It still says medium drink after selecting large. Additionally I'm wondering why the taco bell app doesn't have the ability to place your order and then just click on it when you arrive. First time I ordered on it I was expecting this, but my order was instantly placed and starting to be made."

      "I've used this app exclusively for the past few years and love it!! But recent updates broke a few things like search filters. Now something as simple as min and max price don't work. It's extremely frustrating and I've emailed the developer multiple times providing debug info, but never getting a response. I have to use other apps in the meantime, no filters make it useless.",
      "Your app is really pretty useless my photos dont show up there is just a cloud where the photo should be I have to guess which image I want and if I get the wrong one I have to delete and start over because you can't edit photos once its posted. And you can't manage your account within the app you have to do everything through email which is a pain having to go back and forth.",
      "I'll give it to you, it's a great app and easy to use. I've never had issues, and I've been using it for years. So why the 2 stars instead of 5? Started charging people to post vehicles, plain and simple. There used to be hundreds of vehicles if not thousands for sale by owners, now you're lucky if you get a handful sometimes. Why pay money to post something you're trying to sale? Does that help guarantee a sale? Does that stop car dealers from posting the same vehicle multiple times, no.",
      "I post a vehicle for sell after a few hours I decided to look up the vehicle to see what customer are seeing. It was hard to find the vehicle even after adjusting the category it was still hard to find it. If you're trying to sell vehicle your best bet is to try another app",
      "Every time they update it, new things break. Now, some of the filters have stopped working. I've emailed them at least twice. No response. It was great - once, but they seem to be masters of \"if it ain't broken, fix it til it is.\""

      "App works perfectly. Other than some delayed popups for new deals (that therefore obscure my view of deals I'm already looking at). Only other complaint would be it signs me out all the time despite me consistently checking off \"remember this device\" and such in hopes of not needing to sign in again. Silver lining to that issue is I still have a favorites list even when not signed in, so it's only a problem when I wanna buy stuff or manage my account. I would still like that to be fixed, though.",
      "App severely lacking. Can't buy through app?! My saved payment info does not display. When I want to pay it takes me to my browser to input my information from scratch. If I save a game or add it to cart, it does not display when I sign in to G2A on my laptop. Why even use the app? May as well use my laptop. This should work like the Steam app. But it doesn't. I want to use this app to buy and add things to wishlist. Can't do either easily. Also, can't contact sellers or support team? Why?",

So, go ahead and waste your time on this sh*tty app.",
      "This is a great app. I especially love the updates because it keeps the game fresh and exciting. And, I finally won!!! I haven't won again in months, so I'm really hoping to win another prize...please!!!!🤞 I have definitely shared this great app with all my friends and family and now they love it too!! Thanks for making such a fun and entertaining app!!🙂",
      "I play this app less and less because I realized some people are winning multiple times . You get extra entries and they reward you extra entries if you download their other app Lucky Quiz. I've been playing for sometime. And I dont think it's right if the same people are winning multiple times. You're not guaranteed to win although I like believing I will. It helps me focus on bringing money and prizes into my life. Just know that you might not win and you might. Just focus on your life 1st!",
      "Other than the overwhelming amount of ads (which admitting-ly was expected) it's exactly what it says it is. Worth trying out if not keeping around for a \"productive\" (selfish) form of entertainment when you're bored but also brain dead. ♡ (I honestly mean that in the kindest way possible ... 🙃)",
      "I don't have a lot of complaints at all.This is a good app,but I think it should be.Easier to get your stuff without the hassle. Besides that I threw this app is very helpful and I like to play it on a daily basis. Thank you for creating this app and this experience will help a lot of of people."

      "Ugh, today a glitch creates an offer of \"$0\" whenever I initiate a chat. More bugs in chats, notifications and even listings now. I get notifications way after I've already read them in the app. Also can't mark items as reserved normally. Reliability is down. For those reading that Carousell is a scam or that you need to pay to use/sell, it's not true. I've been selling and buying fine for a few years now without choosing to \"promote\" listings. It may take some time to find a buyer, it's normal.",
      "It was ok at first. But now they want you to pay to promote the items that you are selling. Their search feature is aweful. You put a 10 km radius and they will show you things 200 km away. Then you have 90% falsely listed items in wrong categories. They say no fakes or counterfeit items allowed but their best sellers are the ones selling fake items. Then you have to deal with idiots who want you to lower the price by 50% or more even when you clearly list as final price.",
      "I use to love this app because i use to get the best deal for some items. But the recent bugs in the app really annoys me as it made me lose out on a few deals which i was really interested in buying from the seller. The chat list won't load up. Server error encountered. That's the main bug that I face. Please fixed this bug and the other bugs that the other users are facing. Thank you.",
      "I have been using carousel for many years. It has come to my attention that the search engine has changed recently and I hate it,compared to previously search engine. For eg, when I search TV soundbar mount, specific listings will pop up and I appreciate I can find what I need immediately. now, all kinds of TV mount listing which I don't even need pops up. It complete spoils the user experience of searching. \"macbook air case\" comes in all the macbook listing appears which are unnecessary.",
      "Web app and Android app is very buggy. Chat conversations won't send, and often disappear randomly after an error (you have to reenter them from scratch again after the error!) Images being sent by you and to you are BLANK. Late arrival of chats. Item marked by system as SOLD but I am still in negotiations with the seller (offer accepted but no transaction yet.) Reviews disappear once submitted. App has all sorts of weird bugs, and these occur both in my old and new Samsung phones. Please fix!"

So i made the purchase at 1/3 and didn't get any discount. When i called the c.s they say it's not our fault the it's the bank's"

Keep saying it has send the error message and you expect that something will be done about it but its been months that it is happening and nothing is done about it. The developer need to be taken to task and be asked for a refund. The app is clearly not designed to deal with a lot of traffic, hence in busy times the app will pack up and shut down",
      "Some parts of the app aren't very user friendly. Here in the PDX area, we have 3 lots in the general area. I can't choose to filter for only those 3 lots, and combine with certain kinds of vehicles. I have to choose the North PDX lot, Or, the South PDX lot. There are other areas of the app that needs work also.",

      "This app has been hit or miss over the last few years. For the last 2-3 weeks it is totally forze. It opens, displays the golden arches for 3-4 seconds, goes to the main screen, and then totally craps out. Touch screen is not responsive. No matter what or where I touch. Worked fine a few weeks back. Phone is a newer Samsung Galaxy, so it is not the phone. Burger King, Wendy's and all the rest work fine. I PREFER McDonalds to the others, but will eat any of the,. Luckily, there is a Burger King right across the street from McDonalds, so they have been getting my business lately. Fix your app McDonalds! Until then, Burger King is stealing your business.",
      "When it works, it's great. Lately it just opens and freezes. Also, the issue with the GPS location. I'm pregnant and I made the order and sent my husband to fetch it on his way home only to find my order had disappeared and the order number is not valid without the GPS location being at the McDonald's. That makes no sense. He downloaded the app and signed in to my account and the order was just gone. I can only seem to use the app if I go to one location across town and I have to be present.",
      "This app throws me out on a regular basis and I have to sign in again (as the woman is asking me for my money). In addition many of the discounts and offers want you to make your purchase on the app. I STILL write checks and mail them to pay my Bills. I have no desire to use a mobile app to place my order. ( I was unable to participate in the gold cup sweepstakes either).",
      "The deals, interface, and ease of use is great. The issue is the app remembering who you are. It constantly kicks me out and I have to sign back in and I no longer can pay through the app which makes some of the deals useless. It removed my form of payment and whenever I attempt to re-enter it, the text box stays blank. I've tried multiple cards, uninstalling and reinstalling, creating a separate account, but nothing seems to work. Disappointed. Please fix.",
      "This was a good app years ago (when it worked) but it's always been incredibly unstable. Now it's locked me out. I uninstalled/reinstalled, tried to log in but the screen just freezes... which is typical. There's some good deals on it, but I'd say about half the times I try it, it just bugs out."

I was thinking that I would order something from this app but when i see it doesn't open and shows blank, i felt that, i have mistake that i install this app. Amazon, Flipkart and myntra is better than this app. Worst app in the world.",
      "worst app and I must say worst customer support. return/replace service is broken both in app and web. it says temporarily unavailable in web and in app it just gets stuck with first step without showing an option to select why we are returning and replacing. We can't proceed further. When contacted customer care with all details they just said try again. So many people are complaining regarding this but no action taken.",
      "This is worst app I have ever seen. Everytime you add an item to the cart, they say out of stock, I searched 50+ items, all are out of stock. Why can't you people exclude these kind of items when you don't have these items from the search. Totally time waste app. I want to give zero rating to this for killing my precious time. Update please exclude out of stock items in search, everything I add in cart, is out of stock, very irritating app. At least you should maintain basic feature",
      "It's a worst app which I have used till now. Don't come in their trap they give wonderful offers but they have worst return policy. Return option doesn't show on order page and u have to call them for raising any return request. After 1or2 returns they flag ur account restricted to avail any return or replacement. If any shopping site will not accept returns so why people will purchase with them? No one can't wear wrong size clothes. Better to shop from Flipkart or Amazon they are way better.",
      "Most pathetic app. Tried informing customer support but they dont wish to act. Half of the features dont work speacially returns. It seems like app developed by beginners product team and not being duly compensated."

      "The worst customer service.... firstly you dont have a number on your app to contact customer support or complaints. The person on the chat never has any solution to any issues. Not sure why do you even have a chat service when you cannot help your customer. I had just purchased the Bundle with Cheers included. However due to some error on the app I cannot use Cheers. I had only realised it when I tried using it last night.When I reported to chat service I was denied any solution. TERRIBLE...!!!",
      "App lags at times. Was quite embarished when I ordered at pizza hut and it kept showing error message. Other then that, it is extremely worthid. Saved R114 with one order.",
      "Amazing deals, the service is 5 star. But the app is kind of bad, it's not the easiest to find stuff in your area or somewhere you are planning to go. A map with pins of all the activities in that area would be nice to have on the home screen bar. Thing is that I know this is on the app but I always struggle to find it because it is not easy accessable. Apart from that it's really worth having this even if you sometimes spend time digging through deals to find one that suits you.",
      "Cape Town 2019 worked wonderfully, but I wasted my money buying for 2020 because the app stopped working. I cannot log in, I just get Failed, Please Try Again over & over again. I know my login details are correct, because it lets me login on the website on a PC. But that is of no use if I can't log into phone app. Customer Service just says they verify my account is fine and that their app is fine. But then why could I log in last year and now not? So disappointed, because last year was great.",
      "I have registered for The Entertainer 2020 app and already availed the offer once and i keep getting emails to my registered email id. But now app shows as all my offers as locked. When i contacted The Entertainer they are saying that nothing is registered with my email id. If nothing is registered why am i getting email asking fo review of my usage in 2020. I have never experienced such a pathetic service any service provider. Worst experience ever."
