      "This game has a lot of potential. Though, a few small changes could greatly improve your playerbase and revenue. 1. Remove cost for grenades. All players should have access to grenades. Increase cost for reviving to make up revenue. 2. Add a first person perspective, for those who have trouble with TPP. 3. Reduce how often a prop makes noise to 45 seconds. This allows 3 calls per prop, per game instead of 5. This should balance team winnings. Thanks for reading, hope this gives you ideas",
      "Actually the concept of the game is so good. But there are some things from which the game is rated 4.2 instead of 4.5+. First of all is that a prop can turn hunters into pigs, goats, etc. This is totally unfair, this feature must be removed. Second thing is respawning of Props, whenever hunters kill 2-3 props on their own, their efforts are washed off if the prop respawns again. Remove this feature too. I hope you guys will see this feedback. And remove these feature to make the game better.",
      "My favorite game along with Clash of Clans. I play it everyday and have the most fun. Of course it can be laggy with bad connections, but it it awesome for the most part. I really want a new map even though I am satisfied with what there is. This is a must-download game. ('U')",
      "Playing prop is exceptionally difficult- it being difficult to select objects to transform into, not even to mention the inevitable sound and emote. I think the devs should either remove the smiley faces that play over your prop OR be able to reset the emote timer by changing objects or moving a certain distance. This is only one star to attract the dev's attention. Please take note.",
      "So ive been playing this game for 2 yrs now and this never happened I spawned as a giant bear and In the hp shop the I dicided that I wanted to be a hp bag and hid behind another bag with the same type of bag.now usualy when the time is like this 00:00 on top of the screen it comes like PROPS WIN or HUNTERS WIN.I didnt get caught but on my screen there was nothing I dont get it and this happend yesterday,last night I thought that the hunter was cheating but now I think the game is cheating."

Player pawns do not move like soldiers, they move slow, like drunk elephants. Turning the sensitivity up helps turning, but movement is not adequate. Battle pass!? $60 for a karambit? Talk about pay to win... if you want this game to be successful then give the people cool stuff, for free. If you want people to play this game, make it feasible.",

It is illogical that the robots of the game have weapons that the common players cannot buy. This was a good game before. now it is ridiculous and unbalanced. and to think that I invested so much money in this game that now it is an absolute loss. I lost 11k gold trying to upgrade my weapons. 120 upgrade points and only get 1 point in all? seriously guys?",

      "Fun to begin with. Then the pay to play appear. Then the hacked cheaters. Ridiculous mismatched game lobbies, put 20 rounds in a player and they kill you with one. Same game as WW2 Heroes. Multiple ads, failed game \"rewards\", crates with repetitive contents and a 100ish Euro for an in game weapon! You will get massively frustrated very quickly! Bye now",

But now just after giving it five stars they \"updated\" the game and I can't play any games in any mode. Did everything. But the same error keeps coming.

      "I love this game but it needs a stunt map and maybe an off road map, maybe also make it so you can customize the cars, and upgrade the engine or you can give them camber or whatever, you know. It would be very cool. And more people would definitely play this game. Just saying, I used to play this game a lot. But I kind of got bored of it. But it's a good game. I still love it don't get me wrong. maybe add some new trucks or something, anyway i give it a 5⭐ rating",
      "Great game but all it need is More guns and explosives, ability to aim with the automatic weapons instead of just shooting free aiming, character customization like clothes tattoos and hairstyles skin color etc, more options for vehicle customization,assault vehicles,tanks,boats,jets,being able to ride in vehicles with friends,more roads and buildings,meelee weapons like a baseball bats or swords",
      "This game is awesome!!!! I say this to all players and new joiners not to worry of hackers as I was threatened a lot of times but I had a lot of fun.We can play this game any time and I say more maps must be added or at least more places are needed in the old map.Its real fun game better than those nonsense pubg,free fire,call of duty,etc.Thanks for the makers and servers of the game",
      "Cars should take damage when getting hit! It would be so cool if dents formed in the cars and parts would fall off after collisions. And planes blowup if they crash to hard. This game has potential to be amazing 👌 hopefully the developers listen to the players though!",
      "This game Is amazing you roam anywhere you want and fly in plains and drive cars and bikes and you can also change your colours on you car but can't on the bikes and plains THIS GAME IS AMAZING !!!!"

      "A very fun game, just low auality and needs more objects, textures and tools. But other wise, it's actually fun. Even the ads don't show op ALL the time, and if there is, it's normally very short or you can skip. I'd only ask de devs if they can make more ways to get VIP Tokens and that's it. I recommend it if you like farming, fighting, roleplaying (If nobody attacks you) and don't care about the low quality. ( It's not that low lol )",
      "So, the game is good yes(except for graphics) but thrre are some problems, the music and sounds play on the left or right of the headphones depending which directionn your walking, this is very annoying and i hate it, would love to sre a option to disable that, and i think this next problem may be my device and the problem is that when talking to a npc the text lines are longer than thr box and i cant see the last 1 or 2 words, hopefully it gets fixed soon.",
      "It's a cool game.But lately I've lost 300 vips and a scooter for items that are always broken scammers have been really bugging me. And I don't want to scam others as well . So can you please solve this issue it would mean a lot .Since I'm keeping those unfixable items until you fix this problem. Thanks :)",
      "It's great I love this game but sometimes there's just some glitch or something and it tells me to leave and rejoin the game I don't know if it's a glitch or not but its just weird to me I don't think it was there before when I first started this game I don't know what's going on but it happened twice",
      "I love this game! Although the leveling up is super hard, but besides all that I recommend it."

      "Its a great game but there should be a way to get diamonds for no money spent players and you should add quests and more adventures for noobs because if your not lvl 65 or higher there really isn't much to see,also, you should make the game more exciting with some sound effects and for the future make the graphics better because it also takes away some excitement and currently the only time I'm ever excited is when I'm playing with friends and they deleted the game because of how boring it was.",
      "The PVP system is just be a matter of who has the higest level or the most teammates. Same goes for grinding, as nearly all monsters in an area are the same, and you must remain in that area for about 30 minutes to progress past it. You have to spend about 3 hours before you even get a CHANCE to try PVP, and newer players get destroyed if they participate. Add tutorial, add variety to enemies, and add a personal space, like a house..",
      "When I downloaded the game, It took a while to load, and when it finally did load, it was completely BLACK! I unstalled iy multiple times, but it still stayed black. I can only know somewhat what I'm doing by watching videos to know where button are. If you can, please fix this.",
      "The game is fantastically optimized, the mechanics intuitive and smooth, and as a seasoned player, I'd even argue that it can be incredibly fun at times. The key words being \"at times\", the game is a never ending monotonous grind, that never feels rewarding or meaningful. 90% of the playerbase is AFK at any given moment, and most optimal way to improve is to not play the game. I'd say it's only strong point is PvP, though in order to enjoy it properly, you need to take part in said grind.",
      "This is pretty easy, addictive and a good time passer. It's very simple itself, just takes a lot of time to level up and get things. Also, needs a free way to get Diamonds other than getting them from other people."

      "Here is how to win with one move: immediately after your move, cut the internet connection. Reconnect just before the timeout and you get the win. Both players get the win. This is how some top players farm their rank. It is a shame that this app does not let the server decide who wins and what their score is. Now there are just some rank farmers, which is silly. It would have been great otherwise. Some other bugs got fixed in February releases.",
      "It's good but kind of hard for me because it just is not normal and I wish on multilayer it would find people on my level",
      "I have to give this app a 4 sadly it's an amazing game I would definitely recommend it my only problem is that when I accidentally deleted my mum , now I can't friend her again is there anything I can do to fix this ?but other than that it's a really good game😃",
      "I don't have the patience to write a proper review because i'm overwhelmed with college work -> which is exactly why this app is dope, because in the break between when i need a breather a quiant little distraction like this is nice. And i love the way the app is formatted, with me being OCD with \"app design\" that's a compliment. It's a cooler game than you'd think really. As kids we didnt know all the cool strategic work we can impliment and trap stuff we can work with, and now we can. 10/10 GG",

The skills There are only 2 skills. 1. MedKit its not the medkit in the old version. This creates a circle Which can heal also your teammates. The duration of it is 5 seconds on level one and double it in every upgrade 2. Ammo. this also not the old one. This creates a ammo box which can be used in every gun. The use of it is 5 uses",

When I've been a zombie, the hatch will be closed, but the survivor will still go through. This happens on all maps.",

      "Really fun game, take turns drawing and guessing against one or more other random players. The human element is great and lacking in most game apps. You can also save your masterpieces! Given that its a bit of a niche game, its great that a game usually starts in 10-30 seconds from requesting to join a game. But stops finding a network connection after installed for a few days and have to reinstall.",
      "Too many ads since that last update, the video ad keeps poping up after every game, or even if you quite a game you have to watch a video ad and it can't even be cancelled which is very frustrating.. Seems like you want to milk off the game from these ads while it lasts as there aren't many users left as compared to the number of users a few years ago...",

      "I love this game, and im suprised how much work has been put into this! One of my suggestions for the game is if you buy something, for example the flamethrower, it will say what is does, which in this case, the flamethrower does additional fire damage, and for the drones, it tells you what it does in attack and defence mode, like how the med drone in defence heals you and in in attack it heals the nearest player, and how the defence drone will run into progectiles from enemies in attack",
      "At the start you basically could not win because the game is mostly based about gear and customization and you needed to play or pay to get new stuff so you can win. It was ok but the amount of time you need to play a full multiplayer game is so long that if you were dedicated to getting diamonds you might be the last person to leave your team. The hp bar is giant and does not make it a fun experience it makes the multiplayer games longer because there is no timer so yeah. But still kinda fun.",
      "So I was born in 83, and your game is ticketing my brain and bringing up something from the late 90s. And that rocks! In short I love it! Wouldn't mind a few more \"female models\" keep it up!",
      "I love this game. It glitches at times but it is not annoying enough to give it any lower than 5 stars. Great game.",

      "Since a while ago. They seem to fix alot of my problem. There's lots of animals to be but I think their should be more free carnivore animals and at least one free omnivore animal. I still have some trouble with finding other players. Sometimes the only server I can find other people in is the Forest. I still recommend this game to others.",
      "I absolutely love this game! I've been playing games made by one games for as long as I can remember, and I love the new updates. There is only one problem that really bugs me, which is the amount of slots to get animals. I would rate this 5 stars but there are so little slots and so many animals to choose from, in the next update please add more slots. Otherwise, this game is wonderful and should definitely be downloaded.",
      "Great game! Thank you so much for fixing the modder/hacker issue! A problem I have is the look of the lynx. I think the legs should look thicker like it is in real life, the design the lynx is given is just a cat running on toothpicks. Not very lynx like if you ask me. Also, some of the attacks on the animals are entirely too long or either they dont deal enough damage. Example: Buffalo, longhorn, zebra, and crocodile. Please fix! It would make the game more balanced! Keep up the good work!",
      "I really like this game but a few things you got wrong about the animals like the hippo, hippo's don't eat meat. I like the fact that you can do color codes and stuff but the amount for the wings is a bit to much money but overall it's a really awesome game. Another thing are zombies i hate them there so cocky cause they got 2 lives please please delate them so i can play without them killing me every second.",
      "I like this game but, its very bloody, not so high graffic, and atleast can there be like, items and animals that cost POINTS. That would maybe make the game better... also i really dont like that people can say inapropriate and swear words, it makes the game not fun... and its very laggy too. And i bought a cheetah, but i didnt get it! This game scammed me! Dont really recommend downloading this game!"

      "I really love the game and I have suggestions, everyone would would love it if you improve the map like adding maps and improve the attack animation and add more control you know? like.. a sneak button and a pounce button for the Jaguar and add more skins and I really think that the Jaguar skin is a leopard I would suggest that to you developers and add more animals everyone will love it! And how about add other abilities base on what skin you equip. So that's it. No more room to type",
      "I wanna level up easier :( Good game if you are bored¡!¡! I have lots of stress going on and i can forget about it by playing this game! Its not one of those one time things the whole apps are amazing apart from the tiger cuz someone had more health and was spam killing everybody and everyone left apart from me ;-;🤦😏😔😳😌",
      "its fun and i want to lvl up faster and get more health and i like because its so good and its fine sometimes when i play it have contentcion and its just so fun about it and sometimes i play a nother game i still love it i miss itits my friend for ever and i will keep playing this game all day and i wont stop if it get boring and its just awsome and some friends that i know they kill me and i dont like that anyway and so yea thats why and we will be it all the time and i like to play its so fun",
      "its awesome but it needs more panther skins and stuff please add more stuff maybe add clothing or somthing and I also wish you could have kittens and play as them please do that and maybe add enemies like humans and dinosaurs. but keep up the good work. and if you do this I'll give 5 stars.😊",
      "This is a awesome app but, the only thibg that is a bit frustrating is the fact that you play with lvls that are 2 time higher that yours and that makes animals harder to kill and your always dieong in pvp. But other that that its an amazing game!"

      "It's a great game, youll probably play it for years, just a piece of advice to the developers, please listen to the suggestions of players and continue to upgrade it. Lastly if you could include a jungle war field instead of the new artic zone that I feel is less amusing.03-19-20.to developers please answer this. Why is it that I keep on upgrading my soldier, but it seems it's not getting stronger.?i know this because i always play with majority of the same people.",
      "I have been playing for a while and really enjoying it, however, the recent update to the game has so many bugs that it makes it very difficult to enjoy.There is a bad lag, the server connection is patchy at best, finding other 'real players' to fight with is often difficult , some of us havent seen friends or team mates in the game for weeks. Come on Extreme Developers, get it sorted out so that we can start to enjoy the game again because when it's working properly it's fantastic.",
      "I'd like this game why first the quality of graphics and the gameplay is so good but it seems there's a missing piece like Jump rolling or launching a grenade and also can you add a lot of guns,skin of guns, maps and costumes and please suit the app version that you can apply to all version of android for a better play and fix also the lags and bugs can you hear my opinion asap thanks Game Developer additional info can you please add some game modes like capture the flag ,Rank game & Bomb mode.",
      "## WHY the hell does it keep saying \"You left the battle\" When I most definitely did NOT ???!!! ## getting VERY Annoying !!! Good game and it really could be Great... Few things need sorting: I've lost Gold and 'money' for no apparent reason.... Connection to server loss appears to be becoming more frequent.. Now started saying I left the battle.. (which I haven't) when its ended There are glitches that need ironing out.. work on it guys..."

      "Fast faced action game. Doesn't take minutes to load. No charge to \"respawn.\" Lots of fun, has many avenues available for getting your opponent. You don't have to spend money either. Download this. Here I am still in the fight two months later. This game is super fun. I absolutely love how fast paced this is... great assortment of weapons.",
      "Great game. Can you separate those who buy with money and those who do not. Also the balance system is not good sometimes, I get into a game and am just being killed, my guns ineffective. Is it possible to get a campaign saga each month, after a month its deleted and another one is brought (of course with prizes to make up for those who do not use money to buy in games) Just Saying. The advertisement award is just too low please can it be increased to 100 credits/50 gold. Hey, you asked for it.",
      "I can no longer upgrade my shotgun because of multiple glitches. When i get an weapon upgrade cube from watching an ad, the game doesnt register that i have the cube. Recently a new glitch also appeared and now when i use gold to upgrade my shotgun the upgrade chance screen doesnt appear. I have no way of upgrading this weapon now and i have wasted numerous upgrade points because of these glitches.",
      "Such an amazing game, great graphics, futuristic guns and good control. I had to put one star down because it lags a little bit after all the updates and I always go against players with better armor and fire power. I learned a secret of also getting tons of credits and gold, you need to grind ALOT start with the daily contracts easy to hard and daily quests. I might get gold from chests and from the daily reward calendar. You finish a game and continue to do another.",
      "It is pay to play! Plus, do not spend money on the upgrades. I did and around 1rd of the upgrades did not work. It was a waste of money. Apparently, I have, in 2 days of play and according to the game's stats, killed myself 54 times. Give me a break. The game's math is trash! Fix it! Where is my friendly fire? I am so tired of players running around like their bloody chickens with their heads cut off and getting in line of fire when another player and I are trying to kill each other!"

      "To be honest, I miss the old version of Wolf Online. Now that this version updated, the camera sensitivity is very fast and sensitive and the old version was smooth and slow. Plus the dots on the map are very small and the old update, they were big and noticeable. And also, all the servers are dead. No one joins the servers anymore. It's so empty and boring ever since 2.1.1 updated to 3.2.9",
      "I'm terribly sorry to say this 1Games, but this game has gone down these past few months. And it WAS a good game back then, but now... I can't even get passed the 1Games logo screen! I'm pretty sure that other players have been running into similar issues, which might explain why fewer and fewer players show up nowadays. I hope you guys fix this issue, cuz' you had a pretty good run for a year or two. Version 3.2.4 is your demise.",
      "This game might be an okay game if people didn't come to the spawn points to kill newly spawns for sport while other kill the rest. Also, the controls are a little clashing, sometimes it zooms in when Im trying to move my camera. If there was to be an update, I'd ask for less overpowering abilities and slightly better graphics",
      "The game is overall awesome. Since the update there has been a crashing rooblem that prevents us from playing. No wonder the servers are empty. With all due respect, please take the time and look into whats causing this, were only trying to make something out of it. Make friends, socialize and have fun.",
      "It's really fun I play it every day and all the friends u can make...its amazing one thing thoe I get on and it just sits there with the loading symbol and I can't click anything...PLEAS fix this I spent a bunch of money on this game and I don't want to loos it I would appreciate it if u could fix this."

    "comments":[
      "The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's annoying how these wolves keep going to where everyone else spawns and innialate everyone over and over! It's so annoying and basically cheating because we can't do anything about it and people either give up and let it happen or they leave. Needs a PVP and COOP option. Some people want to just have fun, but others want to do nothing but overpower everyone else and kill them constantly. Not a game for people with heart problems and short tempers.",
      "This game needs a lot of work, you have the ground work there but you need to tie up some loose ends. The games frame rate is terrible, as a level one it is impossible to catch anything especially with the lagging. All this added to players who don't stop killing you, and not throughly explained parts of the game it's left pretry patchy. Another aspect that would help is having a visible map in a corner or something so you know where you're actually headed. Thanks! Will try again when updated!",
      "I love this game alot! It's really amazing. Buuuuuut, I always have trouble hunting, sometimes when I'm CLOSE enough to catch my prey, I can't bite it. Also, I don't know if this is just my problem or I dunno but, I have pop-up adds, I don't know how to stop them. Everytime an add pops up it takes me off the server. I get so mad when that happens, is there a way u could fix that? Also, when I hit someone or my prey, I fall._. The problem is that I take a long time to get up. But I love this game",
      "The game itself is great, theres nothing wrong with it, the main problem is the spawn killers. Mainly snow wolves. Its even more annoying that they raid every damn place. Since theres so many, if your not a snow wolf, they all come after you and kill you. Lower level wolves that arent snow wolves will have a hard time hunting cause of them. Cant even get water cause they hog it up. The game is okay to play, but be warned, if youre not a snow wolf, youll get spawn killed alot.",
      "The game is nice, the details are really stunning in the Mountain Grassland, but I have some bugs. When I try to join the Guild, I can't even check it out or join it. Also, I would recommend to remove the ragdolls, it's really unecessary and it's harder to hunt that way. Overall, the game is pretty good and realistic. I love how the mothers protect their young ones when I try to attack them! Also, if the game kicks you out, I recommend you to restart your device. It was happening to me too. 🤗"

      "I almost gave up on this game a while ago due to all the hackers and modding going on. Now I'm happy to that 1games is back at it changing their game to benefit them and make it more fun for us. They got rid of most/all modders and hackers and even made the game more playable with some big fixes. Great game so far and I hope to see it evolve into an amazing game. Keep it up.",
      "This game is great! It's fun it's an online game and it's really cool. The reason I didn't give it 5 star's is when I accidentally uninstalled it I lost all my progress.",
      "At first I raged a lot, but now I'm super happy with it. I just got it about a week ago. I gave this a 4 star rating because if your bigger than a dead dinosaur you pick it up and that's really annoying.",
      "Love this game this is so much better and i mean 100% better than wolf online that game was filled with modders and hackers spawnkillers and big wolves but with this game it just starts off with a very smooth start and theres no problems about the game",
      "I gave it one star Why because the hackers make the game unplayable and modraters on here kill you for fun its so hard to level up and if your killed you have to star over once again if your dino is a high level you end up going into a server with no one in it you can't kill anyone because the hackers chase u and kill you over and over untell this is fixed i would not recomend this game to anyone DON'T DOWNLOAD IT BECAUSE ITS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME"

      "I've said it once and I'm saying it again. I keep trying to play this game again for an enjoyable experience, but this game is literal sh**. If you get one single player on the enemy team with high tier loot which is almost every single game, there is no point in even trying. You are going to lose. I've played countless games with these players and every one of them I've lost. This game is based too much on skill it doesn't give the new players a single chance in hell.",
      "Great game! Best pvp shooter I have played on a mobile phone. Controls are smooth and great for mobile phones. Auto fire setting is a must for mobile shooters in my opinion, you only play with your thumbs so not having to click on a fire button before you can shoot makes it much easier to play, but for those who don't like auto fire, you can turn it off. Great graphics and the game isn't that demanding performance wise, I play on a Samsung Galaxy A3 and it runs smoothly most of the time.",
      "More micro transactions, cannot win without paying bigger amounts or playing nonstop. They start ridiculous data collecting... Still playing but is not as good as it was. Hopefully it will change. If not I will uninstall and go back to PC.",
      "I loved this game and I RE downloaded it and now there are ads? Not a fan at all of it, that's what made it so much better than most other games. You had a choice to make In app purchases but you weren't bothered by ridiculous ads for other games. Don't think I'll continue playing.",
      "P2W garbage. Quit for a year, came back, and some how you managed to make it even worse. Do not waste time Edit: it's been almost another year. Same pay to win garbage, but now you screwed up match making for the start too. REALLY trying to milk the foolish into paying you for a trash game. That's 3 strikes against this company, never touching them again. I should have known, you made it even more p2w garbage than it was."

      "YOUR GAME IS AWESOME!!! Your game is truly awesome! I'm delighted by the level of custom and organizing features~ I do love so much how everything is well placed around the menus and how everything is easy to access until you handle the basics of the menu options. I am amused by how everything goes in the right place because it helps me with my OCD (Because I like organizing stuff). The gameplay is so nice, the maps, the enemy encounters... But the organization you use for me is the best!!! <3",
      "Its very complicated when you start the game, but when that moment happen, where you suddenly understand everything and everything makes sense, thats like the best moment in my expirience. Its a grind based game, so don't be surprised that everyone else has millions of spina and you have 100. The game gives so much freedom to the player, even a dancer can kill, and a mage can throw knifes as assasins do. The economy is made by the players, so its not biased. The game is just amazing overall.",
      "I use to play Toram online 1 year ago, because I got bored, but it was a very fun experience, when I came back with the newest update the loading screen is very slow and it crashes every time I try to get in, I did got in but it still crashes when it gets to the loading screen, and when I do enter the game it lags, stops for a second making it impossible for me to control, but it's still a very fun MMORPG game to play in my free time",
      "I am gonna be honest. This is the best MMORPG I have ever played and I have played a lot,it got everything I need from customisation to my favourite weapon katana and a massive world to explore. I don't know about how far the story have progressed but it's story is also rich and entertaining. I would recommend it to people who want to play MMORPGs it's one the best out there and it's not pay to win you need hours to get stronger in this game.",
      "Best rpg I have ever played! Look I've searched for something of this nature for a long time. I'm extayic yo finally have found an rpg thay feels platform. Great graphics, awesome gameplay! Oh, and check this one, you dony even have to pay for items! Some you find in the game, you can get tickets to edit your avatar by completing daily missions. Trust me its worth the download."

      "The game is so fun however there is one disapointement. There are loads of weapons to buy with real money and I dont use any real money for game funds so I kinda annoy myself playing any of my own weapons. It would be cool if the Developpers could let us try weapons before actually buying the packs. The game itself is superb and the controls are fantastic both for mobile and PC platforms. The game is very well organised and the shells you collect/buy have funny things when you tap/hold on them.",

    "comments":[
      "Great game, smooth controls, little bit laggy, but for a mobile game this is pretty good. The loot system could be a bit better, but I love that the fact that the game doesn't choke you with micro-transactions and just lets you play the game. So glad I found this, now I have something to play when I'm not playing pokemon go. I would, and will be telling people about it.",
      "This game does a lot right. Plays well, good quests, decent advancement. With that said, I don't know if you get to use health or mana potions later in the game or not but I think that is something you should consider if we don't get to use them. Maybe add some crafting? Food buds? I can't think of a good rpg that doesn't use potions. Except, maybe this one? I love the game and I hope you keep updating it. Hours of mindless character building is just what the dr ordered. Thanks guys",
      "Been playing the game for better part of a day. Got to say the graphics are wonderful and the game plays damn good. The only issue I've had with it so far is after playing the ads to get the bonus rewards you got about a 40% chance of the game logging off and losing the rewards if they would fix this issue I give this 5 starsbecause this is a good old-fashioned hack-and-slash that I remember from back in the day and honestly the game is as good on mobile as it was on console back in the day.",
      "Excellent RPG stories pretty good could lose a little bit more continuity, but overall enjoyable. The quests are fun though the game could stand to have a few more of them. The game could use some optimization of its network traffic to reduce jitter and jumpiness when moving around in the game. The graphics are excellent one of the best MMO graphics I've seen for a true MMO RPG. This is a true RPG like the ones you would play on a computer",
      "This game has massive potential, it's fun and progressing feels comfortable. I dont give full stars because there are many fixes to patch and some quality of life patches is detrimental to this game playability in the long run. Such as the lack of an auto run feature, in not saying autopathing, keep auto pathing out. Other quality of life changes are adding the setting menu in the game and not just the client. Wonderful game so far, I hit level 17 and haven't seen any pay walls."

      "The game is good but there's a few problems with it. 1st of all you can kill yourself with your own traps which is dumb. Secondly, the arena will eliminate u as soon as it senses that u are losing badly. And finally, some of the maps are way too crazy. Besides those flaws the game is pretty good.",
      "So far I'm on bronze l, and I already love the game! I've only played for 1 single day. I like how making a clan isn't super expensive, like in other games. This is also a way to do something when you're bored. Although, the quick plays, I cant get over how I think they're bots. There only lvl 4 and on silver already. It surprises me. But, still love the awsome game.",
      "The Game Is great but to support you I think you should change or look into this. When I click watch ad, it just says loading and I wait 15 seconds just staring at the loading screen. The ad button works 50/50 most of the time but I'm just wondering if that is supposed to happen. Thanks for making a game my friends and I can play :)",
      "Good game but PLEAAAAASE make all maps available for normal races! You only race on the same few maps over and over yet there are so many more that can only be used during custom races. Like swimming maps etc. Let us race on those in normal races too. Gets so boring and repetitive running on the same maps all the time. Edit: those maps are now available during all races so thanks so much for that!! Changed my rating to 5. Highly addictive game",
      "I had rated this game 5 stars but now the sounds are distorted like as if it's been slowed down. The gameplay is extremely biased towards high level players making it super difficult for low level players to succeed. A little bit of competition is necessary to improve but the random selection of players is so ridiculously biased. In the past approx. 20 arena matches I've played, all the winners have been diamond/elite level players. Is this some sort of ploy to make us spend more coins? Fix it!"

      "It's a good game, but it's frustrating when a gunner or any other person says you need to kill the fool with a bullet and that the fool has to be killed. Some players make the game more frustrating to play especially when they demand your role or else they'll vote you off. The one thing I noticed in this game most specially is the people who are more assertive tend to be the ones who convince more players to target and vote off a player.",
      "This game is the absolute best but also has a huge amount of glitches, bugs, and other problems. Sometimes the coin wheel breaks. Other times random roles gives like 12 wolves and ww auto win. Finally, the keyboard doesnt load in sometimes and you cant say anything at all. This sucks when you are seer and you cant type in anything. This experience would be a lot better if you fixed the bugs.",
      "Why is the game no longer connecting? If my game takes hours to connect and it still doesn't connect then maybe I should be told WHY THE GAME HAS STOPPED WORKING. Get your stuff together. / So, the response I got told me to look on discord. I looked on discord, found nothing and the issue still persists. I don't think my issue is a bug. A bug slightly hinders the game. This issue means I CAN NO LONGER PLAY IT. I want to play your game but I can't if it wont connect. Please, just fix this.",
      "It's a good game, though it is less fun when people don't seem to get its a mystery solving clue like game. It also is less fun when there are those people who arent active during the rounds through the whole game. Its otherwise good! Edit: The lower scoring was personally from slight annoyance of other players. I raised it up now, to be fair to the hard working game creators. Its hard work, afterall.",
      "This game is fun, but it would be way more enjoyable if the game wasn't constantly trying to get me to buy worthless and ugly \"skins\" if you could call them that. And the secret \"guess who\" minigame is impossible to get 3 stars, you would have to get every guess right in order to get 3 stars. But even then the chance of that happening is so small."

      "It's a really fun game, and probably the only mmorpg for android I've played that gives one such a good action combat experience. Pvp feels really good too. I do admit that the graphics is a bit dated, but that doesn't bother me much, as gameplay more than makes up for it. The text and dialogue could use some work though. Overall, great game, and one can have loads of fun with their friends. Do wish player base was a bit bigger, these days.",
      "it's the awsome MMORPG....or I should say this is best....bcoz the characters r not childish.... The only problem is...u can't do (or) finish everything as a solo player.... in positive way...it creates social interaction with each others like a guild 😘 Edit:- YO ASOBIMO..I KNOW U GUYS R FOCUSING ON PROJECT ETERNALS BUT... PLEASE LUCK AT US TOO!, INSTEAD OF WASTING TIME IN TORAM& OTHERS",
      "I rate 4 stars because, first of all, the game has excellent gameplay, second; it has various, diverse AND lots of clothes! But it has its own flaws as well.

      "Brilliant. Only if we could save the matches in multiplayer or in other modes and continue the match any time we want. If internet connection fails, we should be asked if we wanted to continue not loosing or win randomly when time's over. Also, my phone's screen should not go dark while playing, let alone that then the match I started ceases ad I have to start a new one. Please work on these. Then I would be happy to buy the product. Thanks a lot! :)",
      "The multi-player app is just off. More than half the opponents that join a game, do not even play and forfeit due to elapsed time. In 50 games only one game has gone until the end. I am not even sure if all the opponents are human. There should be some control mechanism where serial quitters are restricted. After a while it just gets frustrating and pointless.",
      "this game is so cool especially how u can play online and with friends and it still tracks ur score. and they even did missions to get points which would attract people. i suggest that u add game modes and something that u can do with points like earning something. also adding more details like sepectating friends and divisions so each player can face his level and want to challenge himself to face the best players .adding competitions is would also be cool .overall its a great game.",
      "Nice game app but sometimes there is not that don't move at all, it should be restricted if no real human, secondly sometimes I move first but my opponents send me messages play , I think it doesn't show them that I already moved, but it doesn't happen always",
      "Notifications of a challenge from a friend should pop up if the app is active. Also you should only be matched more closely to people in your rank. As well as possibly being able to view your friends playing another opponent that would be nice. Other then that the app is perfect to me."

      "The game is good ...i like it ...but there is no jump or to lay down ....and the maps should be a little bigger ...many be more people ...or just stay the same amount ...but i really enjoyed it and will keep on playing",
      "Good game. The equivalent of a mini battlefield 4. Grafics good. Recommended. Great challenge when u get higher level",
      "Good game but the thing is I wish the battles start together and not join in a half match and also make an option to play with friends as a team that would be so cool.....",

      "This game is great! i don't mean to be rude but the creator obvisously does'nt know how to play UNO because say you place a blue 8 you cant place another yellow 8 you can only place another blue 8. And also when it's still MY TURN people just skip it and cheat by placing a card when it was still MY TURN!!! Creator whoever you are PLZZ fix this problem. Thank you! 😊😊😊",
      "The game is simple to play, low in mb, and is convenient for old phone models like mine. How i wish the game also have the 2v2 pvp feature, tournament mode, and the store has a lot of card modifications."

      "This is a good game. Lots of things to hunt for and lots of bosses to hunt. This is a good game for kids,teens,and adults to play. Alot of nice people not to many rude. But there is alot of spam that i have reported and they are still playing the game and no one has done anything about it. Other then all that this game has alot of dog skins i have all of them. It has alot of friendly people to be friends with and i will always love this game.so plz more people love this game and dont hate. lOVE",
      "I love love LOVE this game! It has so many different dogs, even a schnauzer! Nobody ever puts as much work into their dog games and their other games like the developers of this game do! I love how you dont over detail them so it doesnt look gross, it looks realistic but not gross like other games! I have lots more positive things to say but I would run out of space if I said them all! (LOL)",
      "I think it is a very good game. Very fun! I kinda wish you were able to get on boats or play with beach balls at the beach. I would wish that the house was bigger and you can climb up the stairs and jump inside the house. Otherwise I think it has very smooth movement. A few kinks here and there but overall great game!",
      "My experience with this app is great. I've played for only 5 months and I'm level 200! But one suggestion... Could you make it more like cat sim? Like with clothes and hats. There is nothing wrong with this app. Whoever gives it under 4 stars must be insane. All your games are amazing. Thank you for creating these child friendly games. My sister is 6 and is obsessed with it. My parents have to turn the internet off so she can stop playing! Also can you let us go upstairs?? That's all. Merry Xmas",
      "This is a very good game. Overall, this game has good graphics, cool entities and enemies, and is very fun and addicting. But there are a few things I want to point out: The family members always get stuck on trees and on walls. They also have very short limits to how far they can go without you (they have to stay very close to you). This is just a suggestion, but if you could add a few more dog breeds? Maybe the Austrailian Shepherd, Shar Pei, or maybe even the Cheweenie? This is a good game!"

I'm level 92 and as weak as a level 40, Why should I even play if this could happen any day...(Figured it out, it was karma, my bad.)",

      "The game is great, it's just the match making sucks and there are a lot of I.A.P. hacks. People play to damn good for their low levels and reporting them don't do anything. Hardly anyone plays any more (I noticed when getting head shot an entire game by bots) cause there's no creativity in the events anymore and just playing the same game mode over and over again. The creators, developers or whoever need to stop being cheap and expand their servers.",
      "Its actually a really nice game but at the moment nothing is really working. When im in a match most if the time I cant use my ability or it doesnt really work. Besides that I join the matches later than my teammates wich really annoying. The games very buggy and its working very sloww I already tried to fix it somehow but even if its on 30 the lowest frequency its not better. So please fixx thoseee problems. Thankss",
      "Ok this game needs help. I've ran into so many instances where someone just had a better character or was a higher level than me. And the way ranking works doesn't make much sense. It doesn't tell you how many points you need to level up to the next division, it just says bronze, silver, gold, etc. So you might rank up to silver tomorrow or next week, you don't know. And hero unlocks rarely happen if at all, And they rarely sell them. This game could be good but right now it sucks.",
      "Horrible load times, ever since this latest update I keep getting paired with bots and awful players not on my level. Which makes the matches unbalanced and not competitive. Oppositions I'm paired against seem to have weapons that chew through my health with a couple of shots. Feels rigged! Literally played 20 games in a row and no points gained because I'm being slaughtered before I can get a shot off. So frustrating!"

      "3/15/2020 I have been playing this game for a few months, it is a good game, graphics are good, controls are easy to get used to, it's got a pretty good story also (although it's different from the show). My big problems are with the follower you have, she is kinda useless, doesn't have health and only does damage when your attacking, so it feels like your playing by yourself anyways, also the events can be annoying, like the last event, it kept kicking me out or not letting me in.",
      "This game has an insane graphic and story gameplay. It is my favorite game to play when I'm bored or not bored. It has creative storylines and is very similar to the manga. I love how you can interact with the game and players along with the NPCs. I rate 5 star because I am very intrested in this game and can't wait for more updates and it isn't even a pay to win type game you have to be creative yourself. All in all it is an superb game.",
      "One of my favorite games of all time playing! Even though i just started playing yesterday I already love this game so much, the graphics, the plot which is unique and etc . However, I do wish there is a love interest and have time to bond and do special things to make the game more lively but I understand there is no need for that. I'm absolutely fine with the game and love it. I hope to see more games likes this.",
      "What's up with the boss fights?Sometimes before I could even fight I've already been hit. I'm not really bothered with the low level bosses but man,the high level one!?It's already hard for me to beat the chaos boss and with this bug going on,before I could even hit the boss my life had already been beaten to half.Could you guys please fix this cuz I really love this game and I've been playing it for almost 2 years now.",
      "Great game! I love the way its designed and the graphics are simply amazing. However I would recommend adding trading system between players, pvp, player ranking for combat skills, flying skill, house renting system, cooking and crafting skill, increase in skill and rear item drop rate, new floor updates more often, and more pultiplayer and guild events. I expect alot from this game. Thank you for your service."

      "New update was the worst \"improvement\" they have made. Enemies drain your health, forcing you to buy medkits and I'm not going to spend my money on a game. The home screen is messed up so now everything takes longer to get to like squads. Before the update, you could just click on create squad and that's it. The update makes it so much more complicated than it needs to be. The only reason I am not giving this a one star is because of how fun the game was before.",
      "This was a great game but the past few months the game has declined bit by bit but the most recent update in the last day or 2 has brought it to an all time low. I spent money and bought their premium weapons and spent money on gold. They lowered stats on a lot of those weapons and they are unusable. Do not spend money for now, as the weapons you buy today may be different tomorrow. They did the same with the turret and have now also made your health go down quicker to force us to buy medikits",
      "I was truly enjoying the game and spending money, until.. it wasn't giving me my upgrades after i purchased them. I receive error code = 3, I sent you an email. Updated 12 hours after they fixed my issues. I previously gave them 1 star, but bc they fixed the situation immediately. 5 star game! Thank you for responding to my email. Going back to 2stars. Latest update destroyed the game",
      "I once loved playing this game but since the most recent updates, although it had some cool new maps & games added, I have noticed that the gameplay just is not equal for everyone playing. What kind game allows me to empty one & a half clips in my opponents face only to have them shoot me once, anywhere, & I die with them getting the kill shot. I'm not talking a clip from some low rated firearm on the game either; the damage rating for my rifle in which I favor is like 270. What the hell!!?",
      "The game is really entertaining, i dont like how it seems you have to pay to win though. I havent spent a whole lot of money because i feel like it should be based on skill not money but i do pretty good either way. The graphics are good and the movement is decent. All in all its a good game and passes time."

      "This is just sad!! I used to play this game for years and met awesome people there. It used to be awesome game! Now it's all gone! Developers stopped updating and fixing the game even though many people spent fortune on it. I installed it to see if I could get back and continue playing but unfortunately the game is empty. I only saw like 10 players in the whole server. Sad Sad Sad !! :(",
      "Could be an awesome game if could tell the difference between 4g and wifi connections. I'm tired of doing the same thing back 2 back 2 back bc the \"connection was\" or \"connecting to server\", then username not recognized or something. An on going cycle no matter where I am or the wifi I use and to think I wad going to actually pay for this 😒😒 02/29/2020 update: There is no update, still the same. I'm on wifi or 4g lte probably wouldn't work on 5g either. All partners of this app must have drpd.",
      "I've played it before and loved it but now on my new phone it won't even let me download the game over my phone carrier network and I didn't had a problem downloading O&C2. Guess I'll have to wait till I get real wifi so not sure if this is just on my end but just incase if your reading this please check and make sure it's not something on your end. Thanks",
      "Please fix the joystick. Just make it stationary or like in the app Soul Knight. I want to play this game but it's so painful to play with a wandering joystick....really just the worst idea ever. Worse than mouse acceleration. I'm probably going to stop playing just because of that and the navigation system.",
      "Before it was a great game ..but now..i dont know what happen the customer care ..is not care of there customer..many player send report the issues in.the game ..but no one answer ,,server always synchronizing ..and they banned the wrong people..and the problem is still there..not address...all they have to banned the victims of sync....they cannot fixed the problem...DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ITS CANCER GAME.....and now this date march 12 2020,,u cannot log.in your account in game because of sync"

      "If the designers of this game realized something, they will realize nobody makes it to level 18 getting to level 18 is like Conquering the actual heavens that's how hard it is other than that this is a very good helicopter game but just make it easier to reach to level 18",
      "Great mechanics, great graphics, and relatively easy to get money in game. Totally not p2w. The only minor downsides are the matchmaking should've been better (just give up to 2 ranks gap for each player) and I wish for more pvp modes like area capture, conquest, escort (with both teams have to switch sides to determine the winner), etc. Plus some additions like being able to invite friends in party, clan system, and world chat would be great!",
      "This was the best game of its genera in the droid market circa 18 months ago . However, much like other great and greedy game developers ( not saying any names, like Shadow Warrior 2 or anything!) This game transitioned to play to pay and completely erased all of my progress. To put this in prospective, I was almost up to level 18 , where you finally get the Hind. After paying actual money and pouring more attention to this game than i did my family, they just erased it all. Have fun in hell",
      "Man this is a great game and very great exterm graphics...bu need to be able to play within the cockpit ..... and please can you keep the joystick one the screen in one place it kinda hard to shoot and turn at the same time and how come I can not see what's behind me when flying in combat .... thank you timothy shade ....",
      "It is an awesome game controls are also very easy then I thought it would be a common game but it is the best game in 100 mb"

But most importantly once server is left it terminates itself.... So building anything is pointless...... Fixx those few things and maybe add crate/box... So house has some function... And maybe better quality pick and axe for faster mining..Game has potential of 4/5 stars... Its fun.. Please fix few things.",
      "The game is fun but everytime I go into the arena I can't play against anyone it just puts me in the arena with no one so I can't get points to buy stuff please fix.",
      "Its a decent game. I didnt get much fun out of it because noone was online :( also one time i punched a cow and fell through the world",
      "The game was creative and some what fun. But the thing is I couldnt progress the game because I was being threatened by players constantly while I couldnt even craft a bow. I had the materials to, but the game glitched. Please fix this.",
      "Pretty fun, easy to figure out, fun crafting, but a lack of things to do if you want to play solo (I built a house, built every piece of armor, now what?) I also kept randomly falling through the ground to get stuck under the island. Would have to restart every time."

      "Needs work. I'm giving the eBay app three stars because basically it does what it should, although it does need quite a bit more tweaking to function better. Unfortunately the issues that I have experienced relate to the everyday functionality of it. It is very glitchy and does need seemingly constant babysitting to ensure that it is doing everything you want it to and that it is not just deciding to do certain things for you. Use with caution.",
      "I just installed the last update and it did nothing to correct the small text! I can barely read my messages and the entire app text is very small!!! Still sucks!!! I also don't like the new tracking screen! I used to be able to click on the tracing number and it would take me to the carriers website and with a simple click I could receive shipping updates on my orders! You people screwed that up too! Please put that back the way it was! REMEMBER FOLKS: \"IF IT ISN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!!!\"",
      "I like using the Ebay app. I do purchase some items that never make it to me, but the same is true for the other app's I buy from. In my case, I have a lot of enemies, and draw a lot of fire from them. I'm; ***Larry Contorno USMC NSA 9057 My enemies are your enemies too. Thay Messed with the wrong Marine, I never lose. God Bless America Thanks Ebay, I do love shopping your web.",
      "App always worked great until the recent update. Now it crashes on every other search and needs to be uninstalled just to search eBay via internet browser. On top of that, it now looks exactly like the mobile ebay page so you can't tell the difference on first glance. \"Clean it up bud. Keep it clean.\"",
      "This is always the first app to give me trouble in low signal areas. Purchase history is limited. If you buy a lot you have to switch to web. Can't edit out search. If you just buy and never have problems or claims you're good. Basic and simple. Might expect a little more from ebay but it functions."

      "Another half-baked Nintendo product. Absolutely useless unless you own Splatoon or Mario kart, and even then it is vastly superceded by apps like discord or even plain old WhatsApp. Maybe animal Crossing (when it comes out) will give this thing new life but I can see no reason why one would use this over all the other - significantly better - apps that are freely available out there",

That's good, and I appreciate it, but now there's very little to actually do in the app. If it were possible to buy games in the app then that would be great. Otherwise, it's just kind of sitting there until I use it for Animal Crossing.",

    "description":"We have adapted Hangman, the most popular word game of our childhood, to the present day.\r\nThere are many new generation word games available, but we did not give up the classic. \r\nWe thought hard about the clues that we prepared and tried to make our game more fun.\r\nWe have provided you with the opportunity to test your vocabulary with your competitors. Most importantly, we made it completely free.\r\nThere are no levels in the game that you can't pass without paying.\r\nYou will enjoy chatting with your opponent while doing some brain training.\r\nHangman is a word game, but it is also a puzzle game.\r\nWord hunt is waiting for you. Find words before your opponent and win. You can call it a war of words. Show your difference with your vocabulary and win this war of words.\r\n\r\nThe word puzzle game Hangman Multiplayer, which can be played online with 2 people with a chat function, is here!\r\n\r\nHow to play this new Word Search and Word Puzzle game?\r\n\r\nOur Hangman game consists mainly of 2 parts. Single Game Mode and Online Game Mode.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline Game Mode:\r\n\r\n* You can play with random opponents or you can play with friends you have made in the game.\r\n* You can chat with your opponent in the game. If you don't want to chat, you can hide the conversation.\r\n* When you enter the game you can give 10 online points and earn 20 or 25 online points. If you take a risk and guess the word before the letters are fully opened, you win +5 online points.\r\n* On the home page you will find the best of the Online Game Mode.\r\n* If you take a risk and press the guess button and open the wrong letter, you lose.\r\n* When the game is completed you can add your opponent as friend if you are in a random game mode.\r\n* When the game with your friend  is finished, you can rematch as much as you want.\r\n* Matches will be made according to your language while playing online games!\r\n\r\n\r\nSingle Game Mode:\r\n\r\n* In single game mode, you will compete with yourself.

      "This is bad. The game has no restrictions that protect new players from the high level players. They will farm you and you won't be able to build ships or advance in research or upgrade buildings. That moment you have resources to spare boom it's gone by a man with 200 battleships. They need an experience cap so players like me who have nothing to defend myself with, build up on resources so players like me can play catch-up with the already experienced players.",
      "I played this game when it first came out years ago,I made lot's of friend back then.Only left due to real life problem,the game has not changed in anyway.But like in any game you can earn helpful gifts for good growth.And yes it can be slow and you will get your fleet wiped sometimes.But if you can get over that and learn to fleet save , you can have a good game.And make friends on the way.My advice is when you start make the most of your free protective bubble.use your alliance chat too.",
      "In general the game is good, however, the customer support is terrible. I got kicked out of the game by an issue with the server, and when trying to log back in I was met with an error notice on my account name (which I use on many apps so it NEVER changes). I emailed shinxjoy and it took them 4 days to get back to me. Apparently if I give them ALL my details they can give me my acc details...is this AFTER they change my account name to cover their error????",
      "Pay to win game, no fairness in game,high lvl players keep farming on lower lvl and newcomers, repeating large attacks on same target for pvp score and resources, giving more opportunities for larger atks on injured one afterward. A player just atk me at least 5 times, and no protection for me.",
      "Since I'm only allotted 500words to describe the unbalanced of this game I cant show you the math supporting this review. Lucky them 🙃 Destroyers are the only needed ship as their tech is doable at lvl 9 Hyperspace Drive. Costing only 5mil metal, 10mil crystal, and 3mil gas. Crystal being the hardest resource to acquire and hold. Lvl 12 drive costs 40mil metal, 80mil crystal, and 48mil gas. The only reason to go this high is to get death stars. By their calc 1DS is = to less than 90 destroyers."

      "Its a really fun game, but lately I've been encountering a couple of issues. 1. The audio sometimes just cuts out at random intervals, not too bad, but still quite annoying. 2. I can't use the chat. Whenever I type a message into chat and press enter it does not send so it is annoying as I usually play with friends. 3.I cannot see my mouse cursor at all, it makes it annoying when having to click buttons and aim items. I really want to play, but because of these issues I can't. So please fix it.",
      "it's a very fun game! But their are some problems that i have found and my other friends have also had the problem. We can not find our mouses when we are on games and/or browsing. Therefor it's a struggle to play games! Also we can not click the enter button so we're unable to go on chat, but my enter button works everywhere else. I'm not impressed with this issue and might consider deleting the app if something is not done about it. Please fix the issue, thanks.",
      "Hello! This is a very nice game, except for a problem that I recently encountered while trying to Login. While trying to Login, It would say that I've done too many login attempts despite me doing only one or two attempts at logging in! I've waited for a long time now, and If you also pay attention to your other Social Medias, many people encounter a similar problem where they can neither Log in nor Sign up. Please fix this as soon as possible, Roblox! Thank you!",
      "I really do like this game, but I play on a chromebook with touch screen, and whenever I try to play without touch screen, I don't have a cursor. I've even tried first person mode. Also, can you please stop it from tagging numbers unless its in long rows like 23432 or something? cause 1 number isnt a phone number or anything! It's just a number! Otherwise, great game, and keep up the good work!",
      "I like the game. I also enjoy looking at the ugc catalog (I own a few of the hats made with ugc). I've been playing on chromebook and Inever had a problem with my chat. But now there's a bug and every time I do press enter, it doesn't detect it (it works on other websites, just not on roblox.) I can still play but a lot of the games I do play require chat. Either something is wrong with my computer or there's actually a bug. I don't know. other than that, enjoyable game."

      "Best game ever. Love it. Edit: lately I'll be winning a game and I get the flashing icon that it is having connection issues but I'm near the router at 3 full bars and incoming and outgoing wifi signal is perfect and all my other apps aren't interrupted. Their servers just disconnects from me and I lose my game and my streak due to disconnection. Very unfair and getting more and more frustrating! 🤬",
      "UPDATE: Haven't been able to log on in the past week. It says that it cannot connect to the server and I know everything is fine on my end. Still have a few bugs to work out. Like when I can't do certain things during battles, but my opponent can (and yes I read the cards carefully to make sure I'm not mistaking something). The math with the damage counters and attacks is incorrect sometimes.",
      "The game is the same as the real card game, which you already know is good, Im here to talk about tricks to help you have the most fun with the game. So first, unlike other online card games, its WAY cheaper to play and keep up. You cant buy anything with real money. But you can buy code cards for cheap, through ebay or my favorite; coolstufinc. You CAN play for free, but its gonna take forever to build your collection. Another trick is trading, you can trade packs to get exactly what you want!",
      "Great game, poor connection! I don't know if it is the server or my Chromebook, but I constantly lose the connection while playing. When it works, it is fun. There are still to many gimmicky decks that any monkey could put together and win with without having to actually make decisions.",
      "A great adaptation of the classic card game and best of all you can get all of your cards you get in a pack in games via a card in the pack , also if you're new to the game or didn't know how to play it there's a great tutorial at the beginning, Highly reccomend"

It should be under the settings but isnt. There is one one log out option, the back button on my android. Which only prompts to make sure you want to log out. I expect better than 1.0. BETTER! Uninstall/reinstall doesn't work. Update failing on open.",
      "Poor support for VIP players. If you purchase enough in game, you can get a direct line with GMs in game, however they will pick and choose who they respond to. Usually it takes a week or more for them to respond and for some they respond immediately. They mostly do not respond at all. If TQ digital makes a mistake, they will take the in game items away from your account and offer no reimbursement, (for example, giving you your money back)",
      "I can't even get past the sign in screen. I would register my account just fine but then when I would try to sign in to a server it would always say \"invalid password\" I just created the account. I also tried reinstalling the game. Still had the same problem. I was really looking forward to playing this game, I used to play this and eudemons online on PC when I was younger. But I guess I won't get to try it out again.",
      "I'm a long time player and at first I was very excited to see a mobile version. Here's what went wrong: 1. I created a character with no problem using the same email that I used on the PC version. 2. I got to level 133 non-reborn, working toward 140 first. 3. After the last update, I noticed every time I log in, it brings me to the character selection, which is frustrating. I tried clearing the app cache and memory, uninstall/reinstall 4. Emailed support with no response 7 days ago.",
      "Cant even log in. Me and 2 friends all registered accounts today to play one of our old favorite games. We all registered and get hit with an error saying our accounts are invalid. Not sure what this is about but looking at some of the other reviews were not the only ones. Hopefully this gets fixed and I can give a proper review."

      "enjoyable game, the autohunt feature is a nice touch for grinding, at times i feel it might be nice to have it in Toram, but then i feel it's also good to not have it, because it makes people to actually have to play the game. but then, there's always the \"bot\" problem.",
      "There's something interesting I experience quite frequently. Everything works fine. I have an up to 5 mbit/s internet connection on my mobile while the app launches and than when I'm ingame: 19 b/s, communication error. All the time. Even if everything else works perfectly fine. So I really wonder what is wrong with your game, your app and/or you?",
      "This game is bad. No story, monsters are over powered. A level 50 wolf can beat a level 85 character in seconds. It's basically a hack and slash automatic game. You can turn of the auto but it makes the game even harder. Good design but bad gameplay. My main issue is overpowered monsters and no story and the graphics are not all that great and the camera is bad.",
      "You need to give back the old trading system where others can trade with each others.You can just add a cost each trade depending on how rare is the item there are trading and how much is the money they are trading too.Making it a more multiplayer feeling that you can connect everything with each other in trading and give one map for a marketplace and make stalls and make players buy a stall to trade even if they are offline. I know its a hassle but i think it make everything worthwhile.",
      "Advantages: ▪Auto farming. ▪50+ places to visit in the game. ▪sociable. ▪pvp. Dis advantages: ▪The gap between paying players and free players is huge. ▪High level gears are unattainable with out paying. ▪If I paid roughly £10 I'd get the same gear as you after you play for over 2 hours each day for 2 - 3 months ▪Paid gems and gens obtained in the game no considered as the same, player equality. Conclusion Don't play unless willing to pay £200 - £,5,000"

It's easy to get attached to this game, or at least for me haha. The maps look good and are pretty good sized. The weapon variation is nice to have, they all have cool looks too.",

      "Actually a really fun game, just need some English players. Grindy game, but not overly grindy, I've been playing 2 days and at a good point, just started getting into PvP. Has Quests, leveling, classes, areas with increasing difficulty, different mobs, different weapons and armour, crafting system, with some pay to win aspects. All items also have a durability so it doesn't last forever.",
      "Supposed to be a great game but servers are very laggy or the game is laggy but its not that waste of graphics since its just pixels, you should create some servers where its not laggy or far from other countries so that it would remove the lag, got killed too many times just because of lag where I keep going back.",
      "Doesn't let me play game. When I tap \"Play.\" It says \"Loading\" and then shows a black screen with all the icons in the game. And within the next second, it takes me back to the main menu. After doing it thrice, at the fourth time. It shut down the game and stopped working. I never played this game and my device is \"Huawei MediaPad T3 7.\"",
      "This game is amazing but still need some improvement like new areas,better servers, new controls, but i still like it and can you guys add a add friend icon? I've just got a new friend in this game so i'm just in there clan",
      "The game provides an experience that feels fresh in the play store. Albeit you will have to grind here and there, it doesn't take hours on end to get there. The fighting mecanics definitely needs some more work and the lag needs to be dealt with but the game has plenty of potential."

      "This was the game i have spent my whole life trying to find! first you can fight battles to get money and exp for your account in game then you can make up to 10 or 11 (edit:it's 15 or 14 now) of your own fighters with different fighting styles and you can put weapons on them as well or you can buy fighters with styles only they have. (edit:one of them can transform 1 time the other can transform 2 times) I started playing in 2019 august.(Edit:you should have custom characters walk, run please.",
      "Man, I love this game. Thank you so much for creating this. Suggestions for future updates: • Female Bodies. • Main Cast Abilities included in customization. • More \"Alien\" parts. • Changing movement type. (One of my custom characters is a speed-type character but when moving, it flies.) • More weapons. • Include Dakar's pose and the glowing eye.",
      "Upon playing for so many hours, all i can say is it needs more content and item variety. More body types is a highly recommended addition especially female, beast-like, and mecha-like. Otherwise, a great game that you can play for hours because you can get every content by playing. Some items are only obtainable in challenges which is rare nowadays.",
      "I love the game. I play this game whenever I want. The online mode is a bit laggy, depending which internet you're using, but It's still possible to beat the players. The only thing(s) I wish for is that there could be different body types. Like muscular, female, short, lanky, ECT. But all in all, great game.",
      "This game is great and i love that you could get creative and make your own character and their attacks but i would rate 5 stars if more characters,weapons,clothes,more body types like female and muscular,add more challenges,more attacks,and maybe even put in a story mode to it(which would make it a lot more interesting than it is now)i know that this isn't easy editing a game and is hard work but keep it up"

      "I love this game but there are some things that bother and made me rate it so low. Firts of all this the only game i wrote a review and i downloaded 4 times only to find that i couldn't get back the progress of my previous accounts. Second of all it so obvious too much p2w i know you that making my is the purpose but it needs an enviroment friendly to players who wont play. Take for instance others games and put a ranking system why me as a level 4 with the assault rifle i have to play vs lvl 50",
      "The gameplay is great but it has become a pay to win game and the connection on multiplayer mode is very unstable .",
      "There are players that make themselves invincible for an entire match with a glitch that holds the positive effects of the immune shield. It must be stopped.",
      "I give this app a 1 star review even thought I want able to play the game because the first thing it does when it loads is run a commercial ad, don't waste you time with this one.",
      "Crazy multi-player mode full of paid players obliterating F2P players. Kills the fun except them having fun. \n\nBasically, P2W game in MP till you get Event Gears for free."

      "The best 2D MMORPG that provides a lot of fun, challenges and achievements. The pixel art brings a pleasant feeling of nostalgia and the soundtrack is amazing. Dungeons, bosses, special events, territory and guild wars and plenty more await you in Arinar. I totally recommend ;) P.S .: As in any MMO, it takes dedication and time to grow and get stronger. But I guarantee you, it is very worth it!",
      "i really like the game,been playing since 2014.the only problem for me is the graphic difference between os,for e.g older android phones with android 6 has better graphics than me using a better phone with latest android version and better gpu.Please fix this problem(By graphics i mean the map coverage and more detailed pixels)",

Again, until theres a better. This unfortunately is it. Not sure why they dont bother with improvements but w.e. garbage game app that doesn't stop bots and clock cheating. the only reason i use this app is bc chesscube doesn't work with the latest update.",
      "I placed bets and won all 7 initial games but lost all coins as a result!! I am now surprised; when I win a game I lose all coins placed as a bet? How ridiculous?! Please look into the matter and resolve if possible. If this is an inherent bug then the app really sucks and deserve no star at all! Now I cannot even try to buy coins...CANNOT...all go if I win..!!!",
      "There are numerous cheaters online who boost their rating by using engines or AI. Chess online, don't you have any method or tracking mechanism so that you can prevent this? Afterall we joined here to play with humans and not with bots.",
      "So irritated now. Twice I've lost now because my timer runs out when it's showing that it's the opponents moves so I sit around waiting for my opponent to move only for my time to run out without me knowing. Please fix this bug as I do enjoy the app.",
      "Competent players and good app.But the check should come with a notification. Mistake preventer is weird,it can't differentiate btn a logical \"mistake \" and a blunder move."

    "comments":[
      "The mechanics of the game are brilliant although a little hungry on your battery. What really lets this game down is other players, espeacially those in the 70% success or higher bracket. It is very rare you will get to finish a game with one of these players if you are winning. Once you get them cornered they seem to disconnect from the net and the game times out. You will however still get the win. To all those players who do this, the only one you're fooling is yourself ;)",
      "Been looking for checkers where we can use our own rules. This is just great. It would be perfect if there's an option, when a king can do a long jump, wether it can eat right after it became a king or not. I'm bad at english so i hope you get what I mean. Thanks!",
      "DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!This app does not work properly. Oftentimes when you get a king it doesn't give you a king. It just leaves that piece of Pawn and you can't use it anymore. Also, even after the game is over the clock continues to run. So even though you may have won the game you still lose because of the clock keeps running as though you haven't moved. This app used to work fine, but they've recently done something to it and now it doesn't work very well at all.",
      "Very good app sometimes it acts up but good I just got a penalty for playing slow unfortunately I am blind and I am am3 very slow but I get there this probably end me with this app I am very annoyed over having to explain my disability as I never went over the 1-minute Mark like everyone else",
      "I really like this game but it doesnt have a timer like a 10 minute time limit for the game and no draw limit. Please fix."

When being scouted don't offer peace shield if you can't use it. Sometimes when trying to use an item it doesn't respond. This can be very costly. Need an easy way to communicate with support in game. Not taking me to canned answers to questions you think I have. I would have done that but instead I am doing it here.",
      "Getting resources is really hard after reachin a certain level and the cost of unit production and upgrading of buildings is also really high... Game developers should reconsider this otherwise this is also a money driven game. Is these issues are solved we would love to continue playing this game. And please fix the loading screen time... Even if internet is working fine the game still doesn't load",
      "Chat is broken. Gameplay is slow. People are a toxic group who play this. Without charging 1000s of dollars of money, you will never get high enough level quick enough to not get fatmed daily. Avoid this game unless you have a bad attitude, feep pockets and love pay to win!",
      "The game so far its ok but the hell why it took so long to loading. I got full bar from my home wifi but still it seriously took so ****** long and it stay like 4% loading. Please fix it. Tq",

      "This was the best game, is the best game! Except for two things. The first, the emoticons and phrases could use some improvement big time. The second, lately my progress stops after collecting the 1000 coins and sometimes the 5 gems. I'm never getting those last 20 gems that were rewarded right before you move up to the next level or rank or whatever you call it. I move up but I'm getting the rewards shown.. is this being fixed????? I play this everyday and it's discouraging lately. Thanks!"

      "The game is fun, but after playing everday for 2 weeks, I noticed you need ALOT of time (or money) to level up to many with 400K power or much higher like other players. Games are not supposed to take a lifetime or the US gold reserve to advance. Sorry, this game is not for me! Good luck though.",
      "It's good. Slow and a bit grindy, but totally free to play.",
      "You need seals to run dungeons with others or to run them alone. If you run out of seals, you must purchase rubies, a currency purchased with real world currency. Doesn't feel like a proper mmorpg being that you are using real money to play with others. Questing doesn't hardly award any actual loot. You can gear upgrades/loot through dungeons. Same goes for blueprints that allow you to craft gear. Receiving loot is a hassle, you must pick a random card in hope to find loot. Overpriced in game currency. Bad in game graphics. Bad animations for your character or on mobs. You basically have to pay to play with others and pay for your gear due to how everything is set up. The worse mmorpg I have ever played where you are punished for playing with others due to game developer greed. Not recommended. These are all copy cat mmo's anyway with no creativity whatsoever. No wonder the mmo's aren't as popular as they used to be because of this garbage online today. I didn't expect much from a mobile mmo anyway. This is the ultimate anti-mmorpg of all time. Never once did I even run into another player the entire time I played it. Unless if I was in a dungeon. Which concluded of killing 10 to 15 mobs & the usual boring boss at the end. It took 2 mins to run. An insult to true mmo's / mmorpg. This is perfect for non-experienced gamers who have no clue what an mmorpg should be like because they have no clue what they are even looking at. Mmoer's used to amazing mmo's, look elsewhere & dismiss this app.",
      "Its semi auto rpg, which works well since I don't have much down time. It's easy to play, level up, and group finds for dungeons or can do many solo. Many quests, tasks, and side activities to gain exp, gold coins, gear stuff, mount and buddy activities. Cute outfits, love the graphics, and various options of gear, equipment, avatars, mounts, buddy, and gaurdians.",
      "Looked good too bad it wants too many permissions. Better games do more with less, better luck with the next game."

      "Its a great game!! I invited 4 other friends to join me on the game and they are loveing it as well. Some lag with certain players but overall runs well. Keep up the good work guys. Throwback NOD to SWG \"star war galaxies\" mmo Rpg that reset the way for the new standered in mmo rpg gameply with player pvt lots,housing,farming,acheiving your Jedi by just playing the game amd more. However almost over night the game fell off after a new patch changed the mmo to more of an arcade style gameplay.",
      "Good game. Wish there was an offline version too. Offline version would make playing games on a flight great. So consider that developers. Not everything should be online. Graphics are nice, deep customization, levelling up takes time. Now that I'm level 33 levelling up takes hours. Allows the game to take a longer than natural course. Other than that all good. Decent job",
      "Best game ive played on phone only downside is the disadvantage you have against people who purchase stuff with real money. Creators of game dont care they will just say . Thanks for your feedback!",
      "Note: Review easily subject to change. I got into the game once just fine. Played around for about 5 rounds. Really solid gameplay and an interesting concept. For this alone, it is worth 4 stars. The reason for my low review is because now I cannot open the game at all. I get to the first loading screen in a frozen state, and cannot proceed further. Until it is fixed, my * count is low.",
      "This is the most enjoyable game I've ever played, just one problem: I can't participate in Arena battles since I always get an error saying my internet connection is too slow, even though I'm connected to a minimum 30 MBPS LTE network. For heavens sake, I stream live TV @ 1080p, but can't compete in Arena battles? It boggles the mind. Other than that, it's the best mobile game that I've played by some distance. Used to be 5 Stars, but moved it to 4."

      "Was heaps better before ads started taking over especially since I have made so many in game purchases. It has made me think it is time to delete this game. I understand it is so the developers make money however after spending a fair bit of money on this game I now feel ripped off. Please remove the ads for paying players it is ruining an otherwise good game.",
      "While there is certainly a bigger following on miniclips 8-ball (which is great, don't get me wrong) I feel like this is the superior game. Smoother controls, great physics, looks cleaner and just is more fun in general. I was floored when I first saw the fire-stick setting the balls on fire. Well done guys, I honestly can't stop playing.",
      "Graphics are good & has cool effects like balls catching on fire. Has a global chat, Having a chat is a plus. Physics are very far off. Putting draw on the ball with low speed will cause the cue to fly to other end of table after contact. I play in tournaments and in amatuer pool leagues. The amount of draw is dependent on initial speed, force and distance. Also has rules in effect that are completely made up and not found in any rule set, amatuer or pro. AR mode never worked for me.",
      "Need to sort out these network connection issues that plague this game. There are games where i have perfect connection,it will say waiting on opponent for 30 secs then awards me the win only to kick me out before i collect the reward and says no connection. Not to mention the amount of times it ate my in game money for no connection errors.dissapointing.",
      "Super fun game but crooks are running it from afar. For instance, the ONLY time I ever lose a game where my opponent is perfect, and does not miss a shot, is when I'm playing \"random\" Uken AI selected games. Coincidence? Often, those same AI opponents will not bother to place english on a ball, yet I watch the cue make some impossible curved nonsense. How? Balls get spotted for no reason, giving AI the advantage More to come. Uken should be ashamed at their thievery"

      "Im 20 and I have been playing this in my off time for a long time. Its a well made third person shooter with classes well integrated. It is a bit hard to understand at times but stick with it and you easily have the best game in the google play or apple store. There is a co op. You can tell the devs made me pretty happy with this game and I hope they keep it up for a long time coming with their constant new characters and bug fixes. Thank you game devs for a good game",
      "I used to play this game years ago, and I decided to come back to it for nostalgia. But as I go through the tutorial in the beginning, in the middle of gameplay, a pop-up comes up saying that the game prevents hack tools and such... And then it kicks me out of the game. Happens everytime, and I can't do anything about it. Please fix, and I will give a better rating",
      "The games good, they have cute characters but there's a few things that I don't get, like how there's no report button and that it's really hard to get diamonds without watching an ad, but it's really good and I'm glad you created it on both switch and mobile, btw there should be separate servers for switch and mobile so the game isn't to hard or easy",
      "It's a SUPER Fun game to play! I actually love how we can choose our characters after buying them, however I would like it if we could have Free Daily Drops, that way it wouldn't be as hard to get new characters, it's a super fun game anyways though! Oof nvm there's already free daily drops ;-; Welp, that gives you a better reason to download it!!!",
      "The game is great as it is, even though your team often does they're own thing and leaves you alone to fend for yourself. But as I started to play more, it got really repetitive and sort of boring. It'd be nice to have more modes, and more stuff to spend coins on, as you easily rack them up fast. Heck, as cliche as it is, even a pets update would be interesting. Make them cost 1000 coins each? Completely fair. I just wish there was more stuff to buy with coins that just lay around with no use of"

I still love the game, but getting mystic animals are hard to get. Also please add a desert in the game and a mountain lion as the boss. And perhaps have a playable hyena?",

It is a month later and I have 1 suggestion, tigers. I think it would be cool if you guys added the abbility to be a tiger. I think there would be lots of intresting skins to go with it. 🐯",
      "I gave it five stars but there's something missing.....When I'm always adopting a person on multiplayer it's annoying because I can't pick her/him up, so maybe you can put a button where we can pick the person up as a BABY. And I go nuts when Theres a new animal!! I'm gonna try to get the cheetah, and i got all the other animals! Wildcraft will no longer let me play the game a white screen keeps on popping up, and now I can't play when theirs an update. Ok thank you for your advise.",
      "This is the best game I have ever installed!! You can do a lot of things like do movies role play, and more! I would recommend this to everyone and I love the graphics, it's so realistic. I wish you could add a leopard to it or a tiger. Also can you do that you can carry your pet on your back? But it's perfectly fine if you don't add them, but you have a new suggestion ( ◜‿◝ )♡"

      "This is a great game and all but i was sad i had to miss the persona 5 collab because when i downloaded it during the event it would not start or sometimes even load and i had a good wifi signal alot of space for the game to download and it still would not work so i had to wait for the event to pass and not play during because the game would crash so i am very sad because i love the SAO manga and anime series and the persona game series. But this is my only complaint overall have a nice day.",
      "I have played this game for over 2 years. Last week, suddenly I receive a notice that my account is suspended and can't retrieve it back ever. I've went over the terms of service, and the reason suggested which was tampering with data. Of course, this never happened. After the terrible way of somehow contacting someone claiming to be on the team for the game, I wrote my dispute. I received a reply back not too long after confirming I violated ther terms of service to which I already pre-disagreed of any tampering. I reuse to let this go, however, I received I notice saying they won't entertain returning my account and further more never offered a reason as to why it was suspended. I once again followed up demanding the minimum explaination and pointed out their flaws of violating google play store terms of service as well as the state law and consumer protection, as to which this seems I will escalate after an appointment with legal services and a comaplaint to GOogle play as well as filing both with the proper channels. I only want whats due to me and that's a someone who invested time and money wihtout cheating or violating terms to be able to get back his game and play with his friends. It's owed to me in more ways than one. And one of them includes financial idues.",
      "Terrible character scout rates. Even worse weapon scout rates. Limit breaking is far too difficult. Scout cost is far too high. I used to love this game.. Bamco has become very stingy. The new parry quest was fine until the 2nd to last quest where it was LITERALLY impossible to get close to the boss, parry due to his tiny opening and do a 10+ combo because his MP drain would take all your stamina and he hardly gives you time to build it up again before he takes all your MP again. Im done. Trash.",
      "The game is great there is lots to do and getting good characters is very easy but after you do every quest and all the main story there isn't much left to do but wait for the next update to come out with new content also there is this bug where the game suddenly freezes when you are playing mp please fix this.",
      "This game is great for SAO fans. It has the same story as the anime (both a pro and con). It has many characters,weapons,etc. So all together it's a good app. But if you haven't finished SAO yet I recommend doing so before hand."

      "This game is super cool, I've made many new friends and am a level 50. I do have a few suggestions that I think will make the game better though :). First our wolves should be able to show more emotion such as scared, brave, tired, etc. (Maybe add a menu button that leads us to diff emotes we can click on and use such as laying down, growling). We should have an option where we can go offline and play COOP by ourselves. We should also be able to eat things we kill in COOP. Thanks & great game!",
      "Started off as a good game but then it got confusing logs me out every five minutes. Another thing is we should have the option to choose what level stage we want to go to I finally start getting leveled up to take on the animals then it logs me out by the time I get back on it moved me to an area where the animals are stupid op I can't even kill a single rat highly disappointed....this game had so much potential.",
      "Luv it Awesome Best game ever But make it were we can swim, drink, can get mate and pups, and choose anywhere as ur den where u can sleep and store food when ur over lvl 5 by pressing a button (easily spotted) that says \"den\" and boom! Anywhere on the map can be chosen as den, and only ur friends or mate and pups can enter it, other than urself. And yes, pls make it to where we can eat the animals we kill! Ty and thx, from ^r€n^ the f•×",
      "Don't get me wrong, i like the game but there's been some issues here lately. There is a lot of lag in every server I go to still, you get put in with stronger players if you head to pvp, most of the animals are harder to kill especially the champs and at times you dont even get the gems after you kill one. Plus, hackers are still coming. You can't just put them in a seprate room and expect them to stay there, no offense. Whoever made this game needs to actually make it safer for our safety.",
      "graphics and gameplay is great, gems are relatively easy to get, and the premium part of the game is unlockable with gems instead of real money. I do think there a few bugs, like some prey losing health and then regaining it while being attacked (without using a healing ability), or like sometimes attacking a champion and putting in effort still means you might not get gems from the kill, while someone else who contributed less to helping kill it will get like 15 gems."

      "This game is great the gameplay is great the battle royale mode is fast paced.but there are some things that would make the game better(crouching--more weapons--a bigger map for battle royale--a zombies mode--and more)if you can put these in the game it will be much better.overall it's an entertaining game. (:",
      "The game is astonishing and incomprehensible and graphics are on point it is amazing but I have only one slight issue your game has a tiny open connect problem and their should be a party mode from witch you should be able to invite friends and join a team deathmatch or battle Royale also make it to were you get gold for skins after each win also add more custom character skins",
      "An unbalanced cash grab. It is no wonder that this game's player base is dwindling. The pay to win tactics and unbalanced weapons dont help the experience when every map is uninspired and annoying to navigate. Not to mention the abysmal spawns and pay-to-winners. Cod mobile may shove the same monetization in our faces but atleast it's fun at times.",
      "great graphic as.well as control and movement but i think the fire button placement is kinda bad and the autofire makes it less fun. Its easy for ppl to kill since u have no way to dodge or sprint",
      "I'm in love with this game. I rate it for 4 stars because I would like search and destroy and snipers in the game so if you could bring those in the game. Plzzz."

      "The game overall is ok, but there is something this game never change since beginning until now. I don't know if the developer ever notice the bug? Its been there for like 2years or 3years??The game bug still haven't fixed or improves in certain maps like, tower of challenges and more. Putting in auto makes you stuck there for hours sometimes. And some other dungeon like gem burning area 2F. Some black larva stone that makes you stuck there if no enemies is nearby. Maybe the collider component.",
      "The combat system using stones that you upgtade by combining is very uniqe and worth giving a try! It is also a very social game!",
      "good gameplay and community. hoping if you can add an option about showing/hiding equipment; also other equipment like top/bottom/shoes",
      "I have enjoyed this game for some time now and it's great, but; I absolutely hate how tradable and nontradebles do not stack together causing clutter between item types. I get on the verge of rage quitting when I run out of bag space because I have pairs of item stacks that don't even consume together. Solve this problem. I'll change to 5 stars.",
      "2020 feb 13 update makes the game buggy. It logged me out automatically during 0:00 KST (during raid, which pissed me off). Afterwards i tried to typed in chat. The things i type dont even pop out above my head. As if nothing happened. So now I'm reinstalling it. Cause assuming auto update mess up the files. Other than that everything is fun, enjoyable, and pleasant. Even the community is nice. Btw, GLUT RAID IS TOO SIMPLE COMPARE TO GREED."

      "This game is really fun and nice but Everytime I go and load something wether it be to start the game or load a new map or to go into the item shop it's always saying download failed and it's starting to get really annoying so please fix it!!! and also empty crystas are garbage how do have a 80% to succeed and fail Everytime please lower chances of failure #_#",
      "Such great game but so many problems they need to address to no player support system sad!! And how lazy of asobimo make games with no support system to contact to report bugs crashes etc does your players not matter !! What a joke",
      "Players are decreasing, prices are unstable. Scammers and Hackers were still on the run. Beside that, i ... We love this game, unlike any other MMORPG we have full control over most of the thing within the game. Quite an experience even after years of playing. Although, i would like this game to make a little change on its money system, make a fix price on every traceable item or increase the money limit on trading system and what a character can hold in order to decrease the rate of scamming.",
      "This game is always has it charm. Been playing 5 years and this is still my main game. Thought the graphic was outdated, and gameplay kinda slow what makes this game stand out is it trade system, server, and the community. Asobimo is really done well for the server, it makes multiserver but didn't have restriction like any other games, means you can play your char in any server, not limited to different server differrent char. Overall this is really a good-real mmorpg for mobile.",
      "You can't compete it to games that offers High Definition, auto-quest, auto-attack super wide job class and optimized gameplay it's the best. Because it is the epitome of an MMORPG where it has just the right level of difficulty, a ton of fun and a lot of freedom. Been playing this game for 6 years. And it's rare for someone like me."

      "This is a really cool game where you can live a life of a cat, hunt other animals, fight enemies. There is also an incredible multyplayer mode, you can comunicate with other players and do something together. The skins are very beutifull and realistic, the controlls are incredible, and the most important: you can have a normal family, create generations, be pregnant and raise kittens! The best cat simulator I have ever seen!",
      "Its really good game I have online friends from that game :) and why 2 stars? well....every time I play online with my friends it keeps kick me out and its says my internet connection is bad but it's NOT! I love that game but you need to fix this but it's ok.... ;-; but I want to play with my friends without kicking me out. Have a good day! I don't judge anyone:)",
      "I love this game! I play almost everyday... even if the graphics arnt the best. I love the Warrior cats series so this game is perfect for me. At first i thoght this game would be terrible but it was the oppisite. One thing tho you lose energy so easily and it took me 2 years to unlovk everything so please make it easier!",
      "It glitches, in a good way! I love how many places you can go and I love raising families. And, my favorite part about this game is....the houses! The houses are amazing because you can decide if your family members stay in the house or hunt with you. But one day randomly when I got on my progress was gone and it had no option to restore it. After all I love how messed up this game is and love the idea. :3",
      "This is one of the best Cat Simulators out there, it's very realistic and you can customize your Cat with many Skins. Bugs are still happening, like Prey lagging and falling through the Floor, but overall it's pretty good. The only thing I don't like is how you can't choose the Cat's Eye Color like in WildCraft. My Cat has Red Eyes because it has the Black and White Skin, but I wish it had Blue Eyes. Multiplayer is fun, I haven't encountered a bully at all! Anyway, this is an awesome Simulator!"

      "The game is really fun, but the one thing that bothers me is when I'm in the freeze tag mode the tagger is able to hit me from 5-10 meters or however the game measurement is away, but when I am the tagger I can't even do that, even when I have a really low ping, or high ping. Another thing is that why have two extra currencies instead of just a main one and an extra? I think it would just be easier to have it like that, instead of having cubes as well. This is what sucks for me. It is still fun.",

      "The game is fun but there are a lot of glitches, Selina's special power tends to glitch the character out when unfreezed, most of the time where I want to adopt pets or check events, I would keep getting the \"connection error\" message every single time though my Internet is perfectly fine, I've tried closing and opening the app again but it's still like that, I advice making more maps so that we can have more fun instead of playing the same thing",
      "This game is bugged I can't join my friend even though I have him in friend list now the friend list also doesn't work I can't get invites or my friend and it says I'm offline even though I am online please fix this.this game deserves a 5 star but this bug/glitch is really making me mad 😠",
      "I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!! It's so amazing and it's very entertaining... Although i think this is a glitch.. I put the frequent flyer on the Eagle Koobird but i can't unequip it. The button is gray. I put it on the bird on mistake now i can't take it off.. But idc anymore its a unique glitch. I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS GAME OMG THERE R EVEN TRAILS?!? Tysm for this amazing game❤❤❤💕❤❤💕❤💕💕❤",
      "It logs you out sometimes that's an issue the other one is that sometimes it dont let you accept your friends invitation the rest of the game is fine just fix that because that's really irritating.",
      "I really wanted to play for my first time.. I click on the app to start to play and it loads quickly but suddenly stops at 80%.. Seriously?! I try again for the second time. Again! I reinstall it and AGAIN this app is not working AT ALL..DO NOT USE!! Wasted my time to install this.. I hate this game. WARNING: DO NOT INSTALL."

      "While playing game crazy cannon, while loading to next level, it says error and gets out of the game. No matter how good the connection was. It just come out. Experienced many time. This time i got high score in second level which i can get 200extra gems minimum. But 100gems even didnt get. This app is very worst",
      "This app is very good and friendly one while compared to other apps. The products whatever I recieved is best and worthy. The returning policy is very good, and will refund prompt on time. Even delivery time, packing everything I liked a lot.. I suggest its the one of the best app in the market.",
      "This app given false promotions most of the time.. for example they say offer price for an item starting from 9999 but when you click on that item the price will show 10999... There are alot like this... If asked these people wil say seller changed the price .. if the seller changes the price why don't these people take out that promotion ad.. just fooling customers by using their app in this cheap way to earn money...",
      "Lot of issues- * App has become so slow (flipkart web seems fast when opened in laptop in same WiFi). Most of the times, it will not even load the pages properly in app. *If we change the delivery address or pin code, it's not reflecting immediately in the app (better in web) *Filter option are not working properly (both app and Web). If I click the \"see similar products\" under a particular offer (Eg: buy 3 for 10% category) & then filter the category, then IT ll not work. PLS DON'T ASK TO MAIL",
      "I am very happy with this app its service too good, price is also good on any thing which we buy as accessories playing equipment e.t.c this app very good for shopping. I am very satisfied form the service of flipkart. So guys i suggest you to use the filpkart app for shopping. It's platform is good for shopping fast delivery."

Servers are always full of people so no problem to fill the seats. To unlock maps we need game coins which are acquired from watching ad videos or paying real money. Strongly recommended! I'm actually having to reavaliate other games I already gave 5 stars to 4 because it wouldn't be fair to keep them up to annelids",
      "I love absolutely everything about this game. I don't mean to be anything at all bad and all I ask is..Sorry, if I am. Anyways, just to look over the game, maybe with tests, and think about it for a while. If this is necessary and makes the customers happy in any way shape or form.. 🙂♥❤👍🏼",

      "Good, but when I want to play with the multiplayer system, it again and again takes me out and I again have to join the group. And it also comes very late, the group. And it gets a lots of hangness. I think you may understand it and this may be fixed",

      "Where to begin? I just opened this game to find its loaded with little people running around fighting, talking and ???. Unfortunately some of us are dumb and need tutorials and /or instructions of some sort. Lol! Such as how do I change my character from male to female? My name is Ladyrock and I'm running around in a males body!!! I'm told that I can build a house but not told where. I have a profile but it's blank and I don't know how to fill it in. That said, I think I may love this game. LOL",
      "The game is great but i was wondering if you can add a bank to put coins in and get it out whenever we want because it would be helpful for people who are farming coins so they won't die losing coins.",
      "Not bad for a new start but you have to fix alot of things and Im telling all of it to you to make it a better game. The first one is the graphics. You gotta make make it smooth like Deltaria(I like Deltaria's graphics) Second one is easier jobs you gotta add a quests that actually gives you a decent coins also potion making might be a good idea(like adding different stuff to make a potion and you have to sell it to the witch) Third is a better tutorial. Goodluck!",
      "As an actual game it's not that great, however it's more a proof of concept for the engine it runs on, so better things from this as well as the developer's future projects can be expected",
      "Where do I even start? Your first weapon is too weak to do any significant damage to AI enemies, said enemies regen health which doesn't make sense in an RPG, MMO or otherwise, grinding for gold to buy any form of helpful gear is grueling, there are no dedicated servers for specific regions, there's no form of armor to increase defense, and the only place to grind for gold and materials is in PVP areas, which is really bad for new players. I'm sorry, but your game is an unbalanced mess"

      "videos pop up randomly during a game and then the game screen is lost I lose stars when this happens and the game which is really frustrating. I watch ads anyways why are shoving them down my throat?. I also tried to invite my fiance for a game loged into facebook (both of us) but we couldn't invite each other for a game why is that? I am also a begginer why am I put againts lvl 49?. The app also glitches alot I am having too many issues with the app it's not even fun anymore.",
      "Great app, 1v1 player mode is great! Not sure what you changed but videos pop up randomly now during a game and then the game screen is lost. I lose stars when this happens and game progress which is really frustrating. I haven't checked yet if I lose the games that get interrupted. I voluntarily watch adds for stars, why are you forcing me to watch videos, lose game progress and stars?",
      "The game is fine & easy to navigate. It requires a fast network. Something is very wrong with this update. It can crush during a game and sometimes when you start a match playing black, the opponent's pieces in white never moves like s/he didn't play ant when time runs out, it can be recorded as a loss. I played 108 games and won 85 lost 6 and 2 draws, the remaining 15 were recorded as lost games due to the system failure. I truly hate it but I have no option. It is still the best. FIX IT.",
      "You have a problem you're side when I try to login via Facebook, it states that I can't login via Facebook because you're app has an issue with the implementation of Facebook login! Why can't I change my name? My profile looks whack! Guest898373 really? If you can't be bothered to sort the issue above at least let us change our names from guest to whatever we want! Your what's new is a lie, it's now 09-03-2020 and my time is 1:45 and we still have Facebook login issues....",
      "The only thing this app has going for it is it's interface! The app is so glitchy. It doesnt load you into games on time. It puts you on the wrong side of the chess board so you can't play. There is no reward system for winning a game. If you Win most of the time you get nothing and are left to watch a 30 second ad to play one game or wait half an hour. Most of the time I am left the wait till the time runs out on the match because the game hasn't loaded the other player in. very frustrating"

It said that the reward might delay for 1 day but i waited for 48 hours and still nothings the otherthing is that it always load or be really laggy even I turn it to the lowest graphics",
      "**** It has a few miner issues, but all in all, its a fun game. You create your own, what ever it is. It could drive, crawl, fly, or hover. If your crazy enough, you might make it do all of the above. The pvp fighting isn't too bad. Different people brings different elements to the game, (guns, Shield systems, techniques) and earning credits to buy more for your vehicle isn't incredibly hard. It is pay to win if you don't like the grind, which takes away from the game imo, but what game doesn't.",
      "This is great and action packed. You have to face off others and even go outside of the car! This game gives so much opportunities to use while in combat. Modes like CTF (Capture The Flag) has a shorter timer so that teamwork will help a lot with the capturing. This game is so heart racing and makes you want to come back to it even more! I really love the way Full HP Ltd and the community shape the game and it's environment. It still has updates and I love them. You have a good game Full HP Ltd.",
      "The game is pretty good but the devs need to acknowledge how much players are abusing and exploiting glitches like the rapid fire rpg, block in block, and having blocks that aren't attached to the car. Its also really disheartening to try to play multiplayer only to get put up against a top panel or wheel car which are nigh indestructible, please put a cap on how many top panels and wheels can be placed on a car. Most of the problems with the game stem from the people abusing glitches.",
      "Its a very fun game, and its easy + fun to play. You die, you live and kill. But, the cars are to expensive to buy, either that, or its hard to get energy. Fix that, and its a 100% five star game. Download this game peoples!!"

      "This is a super fun game! The only thing i have a problem with is that in local i dont have 10 friends to play with i would really love it if they added an option for some NPCs in local mode. Other than that i love the game and there is an online option. Me and my friend got this game at thr same time and really couldn't stop playing. It is awesome! I really recommend trying it!",
      "This game is so fun and interesting to play! Using the Imposter is fun trying to trick people into your trap and using a crew member is fun to play puzzles and figuring out who the killer is! The only problem is people can guess and throw off innocent people, there should be a punishment if you choose wrong, other than that, absolutely flawless and fun!",
      "Overall, a really good game. My only qualms are that you can't add players as friends or something similar. Also, another problem I have is that whenever I join a new match, I automatically glitch out. Every single time. I always have to leave and join back via code. It's becoming a massive problem for me. If you can fix the above problems, I'll happily update my review to five stars.",
      "The actual gameplay is amazing. Simple and exciting, and the hats are fun. However, every time I click \"play again\" it either freezes on the victory/defeat screen, or freezes once I'm back in the lobby. Controls are a bit annoying. I wish you could friend and block people. I have met lots of people who make the game even more fun, but there is no way to see when they are online or what server they are playing on. Really fun game, but iffy mechanics. Despite that, I would still recommend it.",
      "This is just pure evil genius!! You play this game and you will grow as person, this game is about trust and betrayal.. It makes you keep thinking finding clues and be creative. It's also a game for trolls.. trolling with your friends.. limitless hours of fun. Just need voice chat for meetings if possible and dc fix. But still 5 stars for me!"

      "The good thing about this app is that you will always purchase stylish and fancy clothing and while you are browsing you will come across no ads. Bad thing is that 90% clothing are made up of polyester. The quality of clothes isn't that good, sometimes they look cheap. Another thing that I dont like is the delivery charges and duration. Delivery charge is 166 that seems high and sometimes it takes 12 to 14 days for a parcel to be delivered.",
      "Best app ever! Amazing quality and unbelievable styles. Prices so low you get tempted to buy one of everything (or in my case two! Lol) and there are so many bonuses like free shipping over certain price or coupons that never seem to end every day. I come back just to see what i can snag up next. Oh and best yet, payments! Yes , you got that right, PAYMENTS 4 EASY PAYMENTS! How do you get better than that?!?",
      "I havent had any problems with this app or service. I really like that you can compare your body type to other people by putting in your measurements. I also love that I can find cheaper versions of the clothes I want. I know alot of people have a problem with that, but not all of us can put a 100 or more down on an article of clothing. So this is a money saver. I always recommend looking at the reviews, a lot of people will give extensive details on how the item feels, looks, and fits.",
      "I've had this app for a couple of years now and have been ordering clothes every couple of months. There were definitely some hits and more misses in the beginning, but now the quality (at least the things I choose) are quite good and for the price an absolute bargain. Shipping also improved, mostly takes between 5-7 days to ship from china to Europe. Defiently would recommend.",
      "Good materials and designs with latest fashion and the best price.. You've to do a little research on the dress before buying.. the review section with an option to put in customer's images and comments makes it easy to take a decision. You can also start displaying your style on your page. You can win points on daily log, reviewing your own purchases and many more. You can utilize this points to buy something for you. 💙 Overall \"It is WORTH it\"."

      "My rate is actually quite generous. The app isn't well written in the first place and hasn't been updated to run smoothly on newer devices it seems. It ran an my almost 5 yr old lg tablet no problem but when I got an lg stylo 4 the whole thing just became worse. Honestly if you don't have the patience or at the very least an older device to run the game on then don't even think about installing.",
      "It's a nice game but for some reason I can't play the prologue completely even tho I downloaded the data. Everytime I get defeated by that boss in prologue the game will stop and when I log in again, it's still the same but I got no problem if I skip that part buuuut I really wanna see how it ends. Update: When I entee specific cave the game shut down and when I re-login it's still the same, I'm stuck in the loading screen help",
      "I highly support to have playing RPG games that have old time Japanese vibe. Even though there a lot negative comment about this game, it's none of my business to enjoy myself. Keep it up Developer! Keep updating and do a lot maintenance for this game.",
      "The auto rotate screen gives me headaches and the controller is just awful. You try to attack the enemy but your character attacks a different area, You need to really place your screen and your character has to face the enemy on order to attack but the controler is very awful so, it will be bad when you play. Try it yourself and you'll agree to me. Good luck and hopefully you don't experience headaches like i did during my first time to this game.",
      "I like the game but when my brother tries to play it, it crashes on him, and he has a better device than i do and for me it works perfectly fine."

      "This game is really fun. The graphics are nice but it could use a little more variety in the skin \"colors\", like more shapes instead of just those three. I really don't get why the game would add ice instead of water. I was really hoping for a water dragon but I ended up with an ice dragon. The ads in multiplayer are incredibly annoying. People in other clans keep killing me so much I can't do anything but chat. It's a great game but please fix some more problems.",
      "If your into fairy tales, come and try this game! I love this game and the fact that you can get your dragon to level 1000 is amazing! Yes it might have glitches, but it is truly wonderful. You can name the dragons, change their colors, and even customize your dragon the way you want it.",
      "I love this game to death but... The only reason I gave it four stars is because you can't change elements but you can change everything else. All I am saying is please make it where you can change elements. Because I found this cool fire skin and I had an air elemnt and honostly... I want to have elements and skins to match. So if you can make it where you can change the elements that would be great. Thank You! Oh, and changing the gender.",
      "This is a good game, I like how the skins are but there's just one problem. Even though I love this game, there's this glitch where you get stuck in rocks at snow land and your enemy kills you and you can't do anything to get away. It's annoying. But I injoy this game because you can fly around,fight bosses, invite friends, and do quests. It's also not like those dumb dinosur simolator games were everything kills you really fast. Its a good game.give this game 4 star rate for how much I love it.",
      "This game is really fun already level 164 but atleast could you add more skins,eye colors,moves and diffrent elements like dark,poison light ect. And some more bosses i would really appreciate that. And i dont like the people who hack and get to level 999.999 and there stats are really high please get rid of that its not fair to the people who are in other clans and get killed nonstop. Plzzzz fix that 😅"
