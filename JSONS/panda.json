      "I don't like when you are forced to use a reward of endless life for set amount of time as soon as you earn it. Edited to say I never get unlimited life anymore. Also, when you use booster of helping to aim, it doesn't work well on lower bubbles because the lanterns are in the way. I use to love the game. I only like it now. They also keep asking me to rate the game. Even after already rating it. Annoying.",
      "I have played this game for a few years and it's always worked pretty well (except for one issue 2 yrs ago they fixed). Recently I got a Samsung S20 Ultra and now both side edges of the screen are not visible. You can't finish the game if the babies are in the corner and you can't see them. I tried contacting customer support and they gave me some advice. I tried all of their settings suggestions and none of it worked so now I am unable to play ‚òπ. Please work on an update fix for these phones.",
      "I enjoy playing Panda Pop. It is a good break for the brain. I rate this game around 4.75. I made it to level 1662 before the game froze for weeks. I have deleted it and have reinstalled it. I've started over. Everything is different from when I started years ago. (Not worse, just different. Actually a hair bit harder.) I am enjoying the game again.",
      "The older version is better. I don't like all the little tutorials, they waste time and are annoying. I didn't like that I had to download an update just to be able to open it either. My phone forced it on me. Much prefer regular Panda pop even the graphics were better in older version.",
      "I absolutely love this game. however on March 9th just a couple of days ago my phone updated this app and ever since then the app will not allow me to play it. It doesn't even load correctly any longer. I wonder if I uninstall it and install it again if it would work however I would have to start my progress over and I don't want to. please please help me and let me know how to fix this"

      "Garbage. After you enter your credit card, you have to go back to the ordering page and reenter the security code, otherwise you get an error saying you can't check out. The error DOES NOT identify that the missing security code is the issue. It is just a generic error. The engineer who came up with that should be working a cash register, not writing code.",
      "The app would not take my order. It kept requiring me to permanently save credit card information. Then would go into a loop stating that it needed more time to prepare food, even though it had almost an hour to process 2 meals. I thought this app might save time, but standing in the long line at the restaurant might have been faster.",
      "Frustrating trying to online order. Kept moving my time further and further back. I'd have to go in and readjust the time. It should automatically do that without me having to go back and do it. Then it had me re-enter my card 4 times. Then the time changed again, so I had to go back. Ridiculous! There is never any coupons, despite me signing up for emails 2 months ago. Haven't received a single email yet. Makes me not be able to eat there often with a family of 7. I only go for the food",
      "The app has issues - hang time and error messages. Had to reload and input my order a number of times. After the 5th or 6th attempt (seriously), I was finally able to pay and submit my order. Don't know if it was a \"peak\" time issue - 6PM on a Saturday - but definitely not good. Still good food though.",
      "Worst app ever! If you want to have a melt down you can download this app!!!! First I couldn't sign up, several tries later I finally did, then made the order, when I try to checkout (pay) it said that Error something went wrong please try again, & what do I do, I try again & again & again & again, I finally gave up! Don't waste your time, trust me you will get mad. To Panda Express please do a better job on this app! It sucks. I love your food but not the app."

      "Free version is mediocre, fine for kids. Paid version is lovely for any age and definitely worth it if you like freeplay cooking. A bit glitchy but nothing major. They could definitely add some more recipes to free and paid though, 7$ for what you get is fine just could've been better.",
      "great app and it's very good for kids but it takes so much money and I have to spend lot like the cheap one I said give it a five because like it my daughter was very interested at the time when she have nothing to do she took my phone and watch this app so I think I like this but I think you should stop giving lots and lots of money and start making the apps free to download and everything you can do so I like this when it happens",
      "I think this game is fun but the only bad thing about this which alot of people complain about is that theres not enough equitment so for that reason this is a 3 star rating from me download this and see what u think about this.",
      "I really liked playing the game. Once I leveled up to three stars. I keep playing the same level. Because in order to move up you have to pay for each level and item. To advance in the game. I like playing, just wish I didn't have to pay to play",
      "This game is horrible but it'snot all that bad so i gave it one star. All the fun dishes are locked so you have to pay for them. It is so annoying having to pay for everything. This game is a waste of time and money!"

      "The app is pretty good overall. My two-year-old daughter loves taking care of her \"baby bear,\" but I am really upset about the activity where you put the panda in the washing machine. I don't want an app that teaches my child that it's acceptable for a living creature to be put into a washing machine. It is very dangerous. The parts where the baby gets zapped by lightning and when she goes through the car wash are also concerning to me. If they took those parts out, I would give the app 5 stars.",
      "I'm 9 so it's kinda boring but, well... when she goes potty his belly is bigger... smaller...bigger... smaller and red faced and MORE TROPHYS PLEASE! Other than that I like it.",

      "This game is totally AMAZING you can do all sorts of stuff and also it is a great entertaining for kids. I am 10 but this game is good for any ages I just love it. The thing you could improve is if you can put more things for the baby to do you know but eccept that the game is really good! #Ilovethisgame Download this app. üíñüíï",
      "This is not child appropriate at all. You out the baby in a washer, he gets struck by lighting, catches on fire....I stopped my child from playing at that point but I can't imagine it gets better."

      "I bought the family protection 5 devices and cant ooeb it. It asks me to buy again. I installed the app in my children devices and they got the free version.. So difficult and complicated to use. And every step or page i open i have sign in again aand again.. Aaaah and that robot thing is so frustrating. I started to regret that i bought the full backage",
      "If you haven't gotten into the Symphogear series yet....Do you even anime?! I kid. But seriously check it out. Watch the anime on Crunchyroll and then play the game. The game/app is amazing, songs as with all renditions of the series are a high point.",
      "Why on earth do you need an access to audio video recording? To contacts? Too many permissions.",
      "It's great so far but a suggestion. It doesn't have a daily scan feature and it would be nice if that was added to the app. Please and thanks for the protection",
      "Absolutely fantastic app. Located my stolen smartphone pinpointing it's location and enabling me to lock my device. Thank you so much."

      "Really enjoy using the app, it makes it easier to play games with a controller. The only thing that I have a problem with is after you activate the app on the computer after a spand of time when not using the app or restarting phone due to updates or other reasons to restart a phone I have to reactivate the app and it's quite annoying to have to reactivate multiple times, the app would be great if you only had to activate it once.",
      "My last review got deleted. However this app DOESN'T WORK WITH ANDROID 10. After updating to latest Android app doesn't recognize the control sticks on my officially supported GameVice controller. Reached out to devs with no response. Left a review that not only received no response but ALSO got deleted. This mixed with the INSANE activation/protection on the app leaves it with 1 star DON'T BUY THIS BAD APP FROM EVEN WORSE DEVS.",
      "not responsive. using ds4 bluetooth controller, rooted poco f1. It does active automatically, no need pc coz im rooted. but keys and analogs are not too responsive. need to click keys several times, analog sticka not smooth its always lag late response. playing on Ragnarok Mobile and Marvel Future Fights. Not yet tested on ML.. i'll wait for the fix or update before i refund. thank you devs!",
      "Works like a charm. Yet after a restart it needs you to confirm the app with your computer. Bit annoying. Just like the \"rate us\" spam. It doesn't recognize when you put in 3 or 4 stars. Only with 5 stars you get redirected to the play store to put in your review. And when you give it 3 stars it will always ask again untill you give it 5 stars. So the rating in the Playstore is basically a scam. Will report this to Google play.",
      "It's a great app that I finally decided to pay for it. Does exactly what it says. There is just one thing missing from this app though: NO KEYMAPPING PROFILE. It would be great if we can create multiple keymap options that we can set up and switch to on the fly depending on what game or mode we're going to play. Only then and probably I will also buy panda activator kit."

      "So far everything seems great. Love the game play and characters. Wished it paid out a little more since you don't earn money after each level but I know that is how these games are. Start out earning a decent amount but the closer to the payout mark the less you are going to get. As is with any other game that claims to pay for gameplay. Will update my review once I get to the cash out mark and actually get the money in my account.",
      "I love this game!!!! The Panda Bear is soooo cute!!! I figured out an issue I was having with playing a video to get prizes doubled. If you wait a minute you are then able to play the video. If you don't want to wait, you uncheck the little green arrow below the button and just claim your origional reward.",
      "I have written on support on what is going on..u guys do not reply!!!! Stars not showing up.. Can not collect from team chest..we did not have this problem!! I have 2 accounts one on phone and one on pad..I can not access my pad and when i try..shows up like i am on my phone..what balcony!!! I even sent messages to your email. It is rude not to answer ..thx...I will delete my game..sucks!!!",
      "It becomes TRASH once you reach certain Levels. It STOPPED working once I reached Level 270. It seemed to Malfunction not allowing videos to play and not adding Rewards correctly. I QUIT. All of the games I seem to play to earn Cash starts acting crazy whenever I get close to Cashing in!!!!",
      "I thought I could earn money with this game. I've reached level 23 and haven't seen anything. My boyfriend has the same game and hes at 4 dollars on level 8. This needs to get fixed or I am uninstalling. Great game if it would work properly."

      "We love this game but it will not start up. You can hear the music playing but the screen stays blank, white. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but it is still not working. Hopefully we have an update soon, as we pay quite a bit of money for something that is seriously buggy, and my daughter freaks out everytime she tries to play because it never seems to want to work.",
      "I love how this works because lots of the characters look pretty but Utah full and stuff really amazed just really amazing when I first played it I love with it but the only thing is I want to to have have a baby on here they look quite good with them and pregnant people and then they you could have another hospital so they can give birth but for the adults and their parents and stuff could be there so that's a good thing that always be on their side and no mate they're heart conceals plz make",
      "Game is awesome but there are a few things I don't like one I wish that you could have more characters to I also wish that maybe you could add in some more places like a pool and that's all.",

      "The paid version is working very well especially HK and LA backup servers. I purchased one month for now. Unfortunately if you are in china, free version of vpn servers are not working at all. But the paid one is working great so far, connects fast and speed is also fast, this is first time I'm paying for VPN in china in 9 years I live here, since recently the free vpns work very poor. I hope panda servers stay good over a long period of time and keep up the work. Express VPN is useless in china",
      "Please fix the awful bug when you close pandavpn and you watched ads, they still doesn't let you use the vip links. {Reply} - My region is not blocked and this is an actual bug for me. I watched ad and got the 1 hour free access to VIP servers. But when I close the app and open again, the 1 hour access is still showing there, but when i try to connect, it blocks me from connecting and say I must watch another ad, which I can't and I am not sure why.",
      "Connection has been in general smooth, altho at certain period of time and in certain areas it gets a bit difficult to connect, the developer team acts quickly to come up with backup servers. Online support is also immediate and helpful. Keep it up guys!",
      "It woried well the 1st week, but not after. Also transfers a lot of data when no apps are open (meaning it's a security risk), and the second I open an app to use, it flat lines to zero Mbps.",
      "The VPN is very useful until their connections are not very strong. I suggest that it needs to be update so that people could connect more countries for free."

      "Installed this for my son on his tablet that he's getting for Christmas and I was checking the app was okay for him, when I looked back at the clock and had realised it had been an hour since I opened the app! Highly addictive for all ages! The only issue I have, which is understandable, is that the app has lots of adverts for paid games. I know, however, it is a free app so it will have adverts, I just didn't initially realise how many. Great game otherwise ‚ò∫",
      "This game is really good! Maybe if you can do something with the coins like.. Buy some new stuff for the ice cream or get new cones! There should be a shop button at the top right corner then you will tap it and it will turn to a home then while your in the shop there will be something saying how much coins you have, anywhere you like.",
      "I see that people hate this game but adds I don't mind that but...bsorry to say this to you guys but I works on my phone and nothin bad happens and I had this app sens I was FIVE and nothin bad happen so ya many you should get better internet but one time my phone restarted and I couldn't call my dad and I am all so 19 years old and I live at texis and wach my cuzin mosis he is on you tube he is so cool!",
      "This game is a good game but is so laggy and glitchy evey single time I make a colorful ice cream is will show gray on the cone, when I try and put icecream on the cone it will disappear am rlly old,can u guess how old I am 10,12,11,15 anyways I dont like this game",
      "I used to love this app but it started to get all glichy and now I can't get in at all I am older than 8 and I used to love it.THIS GAME IS NOT AS FUN AS IT USED TO BE! I wouldn't recommend it because as it is the free version but adds are waaaaay to frequent. I would not work for my phone or my desktop. It should have no stars but , you need at least one star to comment.Hey playstore if you see this then let us people comment without stars!üëøüò°"

      "My kids all love the baby bus games.. they are FREE and very easy for a 2 yr old to play depending on the child ... the baby panda ( baby bus) games have so many different apps to choose from and they teach kids so many different things. I actually enjoyed playing these with my daughters. If u dont like one.. download another cuz they all are very different. Some were easy for her at 1 1/2 yrs old to play, but some she needed help with. The birthday party one was one of her favorites..",

This virtual pet will have you spinning around and jumping with joy once you check out all its features. Talking panda makes playing dress up games a lot more fun as now not only can you change clothes, fur and other accessories for your virtual pet, but also furniture and appliances to make them fit better with the outfit.

You can also make the panda jump and sweat so that he stays nice and healthy. Or, you can watch him practice his few kung fu moves because this panda bear looks up to his famous cousin. Good news is that when MO works out, the room energy levels increase faster, thus enabling you to play longer with your virtual pet. Talking animals, like talking parrot, talking dog or a talking cat keep children entertained, but they also teach them how to take care of another living being. As a result, this kind of virtual animal games  is not only fun, but also educational to an extent. \r\n\r\nOnce you download My Talking Panda - Virtual Pet, you will get a goofy talking panda who will make your day and even a week with his awesome features.

      "This is AMAZING PERIOD I don't know why people say it's glitchy it's the thing your using it on and auto sort it's supposed to delete things.",
      "I don't recommend to play this game because it has lots of bugs. A good example: The tutorial NPC, that says like this: \" Click on the inventory, then sort the equipment and equip the weapon that you've recently picked up \". But guess what it will happen next? The \" weapon \" that was recommended by the tutorial NPC, is a refining stone; afterwards, the screen will freeze and it won't recover unless you exist the game (and the previous situation will happen again). I don't recommend this game.",
      "Way to many updates since I last played the game. Very glitchy. The only way to make ur character powerful is by paying money. The game would be much better if we didn't had to pay money . I had a account, and pay 1,500$ in this game, and lost connection, had to shut down my phone completely and got in the game again and I couldn't see my account. So my 1,500$ got wasted, its a pay to win game recommend not playing this game",
      "Game is extremely glitchy, you grind up reputation to exchange for something, then it doesnt give you the item, farm events to have same thing happen, hit auto sort and things get deleted from your inventory. No support from dev.. dead glitchy game. Dont waste your time on this."

      "Hello. I hope you would reply to this review. I installed this game for my toddler to play but He always asks me for help during the supermarket scene. When he gets to the cashier, he cannot put the items on the table. It doesn't seem to work as I have tried this on my own. Even the \"Return\" button on the upper left corner of the screen is not working. Kindly update.",
      "I hope to see another baby panda Sushi game only with sushi in it or more sushi and other types of food. Like more chocolate. Foods. And also maybe you can make another baby panda game with a Halloween theme or a Christmas theme games. üëªüç£. And also take the ads off of all these games."
