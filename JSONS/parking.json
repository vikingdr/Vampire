      "I saw an ad for this where you had to guide two cars to the finish without them colliding with each other. The first few levels, at least, are nothing like that. It's more like drawing a straight line to the finish or going around an obvious obstacle, and using just 1 car. Also there are video ads that take longer to get through than the levels. Read the other reviews",
      "Due to ads, I believe, you have to shut the game off after every level and restart it to make any progress. Here is what it's happening, you complete a stage, a obstacle ad comes up, I hit the x to close it, once it slows it. Then it shows the clear screen with the number of keys. At the bottom, where I assume the next level button it's, is another ad that covers it......",
      "This is my first time playing this game and it's getting harder and harder each level. I know Minecraft has a bug update. But this game is so fun I want to play it everyday! But I have to play Minecraft tomorrow maybe I will play Minecraft first then I will play Park master. If you noticed that two cars at one level is kind of hard sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo I will try doing it.",
      "Good concept. Piss poor execution. There are 12 levels which are extremely easy. How easy? It's just drag a line straight and occasionally draw a curve. Pre school kids would have no problem solving the puzzle on this game. After every level which last 10 seconds at the very most is an ad which lasts even longer than the time needed to complete the level. You can finish every level (12 and then loops) under 3 minutes excluding the ads.",
      "Okay. I wanted to give this game a fair chance, so I played 100 levels of this hot garbage. Unfortunately, there's only actually like 12 different levels, and they simply repeat them over and over. As well, half of them are just having you draw a line to get a bunch of coins. This game is honestly terrible, and the positive reviews are either 7 year olds or fake."

No prompt, no quick start guide for noobs. I looked for a 2d barcode to scan. None. Picture of license plate? That didn't work. Finally left and went somewhere else that had customer parking.",

Tips to PR team: human centered design. * Can't delete account without contacting support and waiting two days. * Can't remove payment method without adding a new valid method. * Can't remove vehicles without adding a second fake one. * Alarm didn't sound and I got a ticket * Only 20/40 min choice avail and I needed 2hrs... To top it off: * Chat agents need to escalate to remove accounts.",
      "I use this app often but I don't understand how they communicate with the meters. Because I got a ticket when I still had 5 minutes left on it. I don't know why the app and the meter doesn't communicate!! If I carried change I would get rid of this app all together.",
      "This App sucks. It doesn't let you change how much time you want to input, it is set to a Max/Min of 3 hours. So if you are staying for 30min you need to pay for 3 hours no matter what. Must defenetly, this issue needs to be fixed."

I used my debit card to get in, I hope it doesn't charge me some crazy fee because it never saw a record of me leaving.",
      "I downloaded ParkWhiz and tested it to book parking in the Entertainment District of downtown Toronto. It was very user friendly and I got an amazing price for overnite parking. Definitely earned a place on my home screen...",
      "Tried to use 2x but both were a fail. First time the parking spot told me not to use it and the second I couldn't even get to the spot. Second time they refunded my money but not the first. Will use another service going forward",
      "I have zero problems with the app and I've had great experiences with customer service. If I'm not there by after the due in time, I get a text asking if I've arrived but once the car elevators broke down and the second time my car broke down on the way there. Parkwhiz texts are sent be Real People and are sensitive to your issues. They gave me full credit both times and were extremely professional. Great service!👏👏👏",
      "I would give ParkWiz NO stars if I could. We were unable to use the $27 pass I purchased (the code didn't work when we checked in) and they don't issue refunds after the scheduled arrival time. That policy applies even if your pass doesn't work! So, we ened up paying another $56 for parking at the lot. Garbage. Rip-off."

      "This game could be better if the brakes actually worked. Sometimes I will press it but my car will keep going. Another thing is that something is wrong with the way the levels work. I will finish many levels and then when I come back to play I will have to redo all of them.",
      "My experience was great until I hit levels over 100. One, you lose a hit point before you even start, and others have you hitting stuff when there is an obvious gap between you and the object. Simply ridiculous.",
      "It's a very bad and annoying app it always glitches when you hit some place more than two times you have to start again which is quite unfair when you almost complete the level . when you want to make the car stop it won't and when you want to make the move it will start to glitch you really need to upgrade because if you were me you woudnt like it too one bit so nobody should play with it if you do not upgrade.😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡",
      "I find it a wonderful and a relaxing game and it is 25% like you are driving a real car the only complaint I have is there are to many ads while you are trying to play this game other than that its alright"

Biggest tip is to double check that you're looking at the correct day before booking your spot. It can be a little easy to skip over the date if you're not paying attention."

      "Brilliant to play if you can turn.................. (40 second metaphorical advert) ........... your Internet off, other wise...................... (*40 second metaphorical advert*) ... Expect lots of adverts............................. But honestly a cracking game with lots of different vehicles, and a nifty usage of the accelerometer, to turn your phone into a steering wheel",
      "Fun to play with friends while I hang out with them,I like parking mania because it's simple and sometimes hard too.But sometimes when I play the game freezes but it's ok for me.The game is quite good and I love it a lot. It would be cool if there is freeroam mode or multiplayer mode to make the game more fun and exciting.",
      "Used to play this game and it worked but now when i went on a level the screen is just black can't see anything but everything else works like controls and I've read recent reviews and everyone has the same problem that the screen is black so fix this or we can't play the game maybe this game is a scam cause they make you consent for ads but then the game don't work so please people don't waste time getting this I've tried so many times it just doesn't work so FIX THIS SO YOU DONT LOSE MONEY!!!!",
      "This is an excellent game and the producers of this game should be really proud of themselves. I literally play this game every day and i am just in love with it. The graphics are amazing and the game is just so simple and easy to follow. If you were to alter the game slightly or improve something in the game, I would include the option to choose which car you would like to drive, but amazing app as always. Thank you for your hard work and cooperation towards making this game, I love it, thanks",
      "This game is great . It's really addictive and has lots of levels. The only reason I rate it 4 in stead of 5, is that when you crash , you loose a star and have to restart the level. Pls could you ad a extra life which when you crash, it doesn't get taken off the end score.😂🙂if that makes any sense!!"

      "Adding a card required adding work address but then the field to add the address was unresponsive until I left and came back multiple times. Once past that screen, you have to agree to the terms and condition except pressing agree does nothing except show a short loading button about validating the card. After trying this a few dozen times just gave up",
      "(Denver, CO) I am just about done with this app. The last five times have been bad experiences with either poor directions to the garage, the garage changes location between booking and arriving, or getting locked out of the building to access the elevator to the parking levels. Will give it one more try. Would rather pay more for a good experience than use this app.",
      "New update sucks. The bar code to scan now cant be zoomed in on. Its tiny as hell and the scanners all have a hard time scanning for entry and exit.",
      "Very helpful, and as good as expected. A very small fee for saving you tons of $$ on parking.",
      "I used to have no problem with the app, but wageworks sent out a new commuter card and when I try to add it to my spot hero account, I get to the Accept button, click it and the app does nothing. It acts like the card is declined (it is active) but does not display any error message. Calling customer service twice solved nothing. They told me to restart, reinstall; the normal help desk script. A couple more tries and I'll need to just delete and swipe at the garage from now on."

      "I love the game but I would like there to be a Rolls Royce Phantom and a Rolls Royce SUV tesla cars and SUVs and a gocart could you add a river in the mountains and maby com flooded areas and the car could fill with water and the motor could die and the ai could have a tow truck that could tow you. P.s your game is the bomb and I love it. With the new update my game is very lady around players and freezes my devise and I can't play.",
      "This game is actually really really great. It seems very real and also i like the interior of the car. But i really hope this game can provide more car example like, alphard, velfire etc. Btw, this game is the best game ever in my life. I really really hope that this game can provide alphard and velfire. 😊",
      "this game is very very nice , what I like about it is it's different car and levels it is unique I think this game will need more cars and levels to reach the top but it has potential",

      "First time user and i love the app! We went to downtown Chicago, Navy Pier, museums and have no problem finding reasonable price parking spots within walking distance. Customer service is very helpful, responsive, and patience to help us with our questions. Highly recommended this app when traveling to major cities, where parking are outrageously expensive and hard to find!",
      "Could not scan QR code once I got to the parking lot. I bought a 5 day pass and reserved spots but got to my parking lot and was unable to scan the QR CODE I ended up having to pay for parking anyways even though I already paid on waypass. This is rediculous. Called for customer service and they were nice but couldn't solve the problem either",
      "Make a reservation on the website. The website and email recommended to download the app to manage the reservation and I did it. But one thing is you have to write your phone number to receive a confirmation code and I did it but never received the code. Try several times and nothing. Well I let go cause I have my confirmation number. But now I have to cancel it and guess what cannot because I never confirmed my phone due never received that code. Try again and nothing happened.",
      "I’ve used this app a couple of times and its great. Think of driving to railway stations, concerts and so on. Immediately you think of exorbitant prices and hour long queues. Not with this app. Park like the people who live nearby - on their drives!",
      "Use at your own risk. Showed up at the airport parking location after purchasing and all the shuttles were full for three hours. The confirmation said nothing about calling in advance for a shuttle just to check-in with the front desk. We had to park elsewhere. We attempted twice to reach out to support for a refund (received automated confirmation back) but no response. Had to dispute the charge with the credit card. Now their support email suddenly works. Stay away."

      "Cute concept, not well developed. Daily play prize that is stuck on day one, even though I've been playing for a month. Couple mini games within the game. One is use coins that you earn to build up houses. There are only 5 houses that you finish building quickly. Next is unlocking 9 types of cars. Once you've used your collected coins to unlock everything, there's nothing more. There are many adsverts, after every or every other level. You can pay $3.49 to stop adverts, but that is a lot.",
      "I saw the ad and it looked cool so I installed it. Then the moment I open it up its showing some kind of name and there's a \"start playing\" button and I press it but nothing happens. I tried again and again.. It does the same thing! If I won't be able to get in I won't rewrite the rating. Edit: I just tried to reinstall... It didn't help... I waited because I thought maybe the button is gliched.. Nope it just didn't work.. I can't get in.. Still a one star..",
      "It always stays on Day 1. You can purchase the homes, but then there is nothing else to do. Once you've moved the cars a few times and received all of the different cars and places to move the cars, there is nothing left to do. There are a lot of adds for the amount of play time you get. Maybe if the game had more places to purchase, or moved to Day 2 etc. it would be a bit more fun. Looks like fun in the adds.",
      "I've had to delete and install this app a fee times now, for some reason after playing for a while the actual home screen \"where we usual press play\" moves down on the screen, which means I am unable to press the play button and so I cannot play!!! It's a good game until that happens ... It's frustrating as well, as I haven't noticed if it's once I reach a certain level or if it's random, but I'm not impressed!",
      "8 minutes to clear the first 10 levels, and that included watching all the 30 second ads after a 5 second game. You can't do anything interesting in the town without watching ads. It's actually more fun to crash into stuff, since there's no penalty for hitting anything except the old lady, and then I just had to restart the level. Yawn. There are also several levels where you can't get the vehicles out without crashing. It'd help if you had to dodge incoming traffic, but not much. Deleting."

      "Fine, sometimes has trouble typing in numbers. As in, I go to add a location or payment and random numbers start typing as I am trying to put them in.

      "When you need to pay for additional time, and click 'Recent' to pay for the most Recently parked in place - the first item is not the place you just parked in so it tricks you into paying for the wrong place (dark pattern). Please make the Recent accurately reflect the most recently parked in place.",
      "1. So NOT happy with the # of times I've tried to extend my parking and been stuck with that spinning \"please wait\" and the app won't work. I even left mid-doctors appt once to run & feed the meter and I arrived in time to see the ticket being put on my windshield. 2. You can't easily bring up the timer to see how much time you have left. 3. If you run over, the \"recent\" history doesn't show you the last meter # you were at so you can try to re-pay. It just shows a pile of #s - in no order.",
      "Doesn't launch the maps well so if you walk away and forget the number it's hard to find again. Also doesn't give you a list of active sessions so you can't simply extend it before it expires. Also doesn't always confirm that you have extended the meter so it's hard to see if you have an active session going. Convenient but annoying.",
      "The app is functional but could use some improvements. If service isn't perfect many taps show no indication that the app is loading. The favorite spots should take less taps, ideally be a one click buy experience. The app works, but could use some UX polish."

      "I think overall it's a very good game, however it has some issues for me and maybe for you to. First of all is that the gear changes are not really smooth neither are they easy to change in a rush. Secondly the fuel consumption is incredibly bad. I mean no offence, but it will run out in like 5 minutes if you go fast. That might not always be the case though, for an example the fuel consumption might be better in a A class car. And the steerin isn't exactly what I'd car accurate, but it's good.",
      "nice game.. realistic controls.. hope u can add a new feature or create a new game.. like a driving simulator or driving in the city using the same features of this game.. but more controls.. good work",
      "I think this game is not for Afghan guys, because their driving skill is lower than the games’ graphics. And overall this is a better game for real skills improve 🇦🇫 🤫 🖕",
      "Great game, I can say it's the best car packing mobile game I have played this year, but I think you guys still need to work on the steering control. Well done guy. Great game once again.",
      "The game was really bad and when I pressed the button it would not work and it took ages to down load and then wouldn't let me get rid of it until the 10th try so wouldn't recommend this game at all."

      "While it's a good enough game, to me it's missing the feel of the original. I played every level in that game more than five times and always made sure to get it perfect. This one feels different. The incentives to make the levels more challenging, like collecting all the coins from tight spots, seem to have gone in this (I've not played it much yet, so I could be wrong) and this one is full of upgrades and things, which don't really scream parking mania to me."

      "Cool game! I love it, good variety of cars. The controls are pretty simple and the environments within the game are awesome! It would be cool to see a few vehicles added. EDITED: The connection as far as getting into lobbies with friends or even lobbies in general are crappy. Most of the time, I cant even into a lobby with my friends. It's very disappointing. That's what makes the game.",
      "The game is really good if I can'say the best but there are some things that you could improve, one of them is the gearbox because ot doesn't really cooperate with the car. The second thing will be that when you want to chose a car and you have loads you need to scroll through all of them which is annoying and it takes a lot of time. And the third thing is that only 13 people can jojn on a map, if there will be an improvement on these things many more people will play rhe game.😶😺😺",
      "I love this game but can you improve the server? Because it is a hard time for me to connect with friends playing. Also, add more cars and vinyl designs and could you add into the settings to minimize and maximize the buttons on putting designs? Then can you have a larger friend lists space and maximum number of players on a server? That is all the issues or the needs of improvement.",
      "Your multiplayer mode doesn't work. Today I discovered this error, probably exactly today the error started, who knows. The error appears when im trying to go on a server. I get to connect but unfortunately I remain there, it keeps connecting forever and ever... never actually logs me into an online server. But, I need to be true, this thing is discontinuous. Namely sometimes it fixes back, but again the error keeps appearing.. and so on..",
      "This game is amazing but I have some suggestions for thing that will make the game better and improve it. 1- you can make a customization option to make license plates and place them anywhere on the car like the grills, windows, bumpers, etc. And be able to design our own plates by using the same way we use vinly on the car. 2- can you add new cars such as: M-B sls amg, GMC Sierra, TESLA model s / x / 3 / y/ roadster, PORCHE taycan, CHEVROLET C8 corvette, MAZDA mx-5 / rx-7, and the NISSAN 350z."

      "This is absolute nonsense. The second time I am receiving a ticket while my session on the Park NYC app is active. If you want added work AND a ticket you will also need another useless app Pay or Dispute. I don't understand why you would bother using this app if \"failure to place ticket in window\" is the law. Why bother with this app when it is not feeding your parking payment in real time to law enforcement? Why bother with this app when tickets are not a possibility but an absolute certainty?",
      "I like the convenience of the app but I don't like the 30-minute time gap between sessions and I don't like the minimum amount for a wallet is $25. They should eliminate that time gap and let drivers stay where they are for as long as they want (as long as they pay!). As for the wallet, I think they should add a pay-per-session option in addition to the wallet. Some drivers may just want to pay for time used. The app can definitely be improved.",
      "This is the best app. I love getting messages that tell me there is a problem with connection or that the app is for older phones. I appreciate that I cannot use the money I put into the app to park anymore. The developers are great with leaving the app as is so that anyone who buys a new phone or updates their phone cannot use the app. Thank you for nothing.",
      "STOP DONT DOWN LOAD...DONT DOWN LOAD Hands down the worst app please learn from my mistakes. I trusted this app and it failed me over and over again, its always has an Error and whenever you add extra time and it loads it and confirms that you added extra time it turns off on it's own and acts like you never added the time. When you walk to your car you have a ticket. The app is designed to have errors so that the city makes money off of tickets.",
      "I used this app when it first came out on an iPhone. As expected, there were some issues and bugs to sort out. So I never really thought too much of it. Finally it started working. I used it until I changed my phone. Now I have an android, and I keep getting the error the app is older and my phone wont support it! Yet there isn't an app for android! Annoying!"

      "This is a very useful app especially if your car has Bluetooth because the automatic parking function really comes in handy. I like the fact that I can retrace my steps using the history. I go to concerts a lot and often forget where I parked but not with this app. I don't even have to think about it, it remembers where I parked every time. Plus it just gives me peace of mind that I don't even have to set it and forget it. Oh yeah, if I happen to forget my phone, the app is on my watch too 👍",
      "You can't top this app, it's as simple as that!! I have tried other apps but this is spot on and easy to use. The accuracy is amazing and it works seamlessly with my Samsung Galaxy and the bluetooth. I would suggest getting the add free version, other than that, I highly recommend this app for sure! 👍",
      "I've tried with this app on Wear OS with varying results but the final straw was today. Parked in woodland car park for a walk and opened the watch app. It said I was where I had been at 10am this morning. 100% accurate, but 6 hours behind the here and now. Uninstalled.",
      "After my husband could not remember what garage he parked his car at in San Antonio. It took him over 6 hours to try to find out what garage it was at. I started the next day to find an app that he could use so this would never happen again. I have been testing this app for 2 weeks and it's been on point every where I park it was totally accurate. I highly recommend if you have blue tooth in your car. It will find your car every time. I have it on my phone for my car and his phone for his car.",
      "Do not think it deserves such a high rating. Gets you close (not that close) to your car. Within key fob range toot the horn! Arrow sometime (a lot) points in the wrong direction! Full of adds. I'd say okay to get you in the area but not right on top. The feet to your vehicle is way off ( 100 ft or so)! Setting in my car warning up (ohio very cold that night) and the app said I was like 80 plus feet away. My mind that not even in the ballpark! 3 stars; nothing special..."

      "Really REALLY great car game. It has great graphics. I love how there are other cars moving and stopping too. My recommendation to the makers is that you should make a mode where you can just drive around freely. Where if you crash its no big deal all you have to do is just reverse and keep going. That would be fun. And you can follow cars wherever they go. But anyway, really great game and its loads of fun. Highly recommended.",

      "Really love the way you guys keep updating this game from time to time.. however can you guys add an extra feature on the volume settings .in a way that one can reduce the volume of the game sound and music not just totally mute it, cos sometimes it gets disturbing when I'm playing music and playing the game at the same time cos' I dont want to totally loose the sound effects....I'd like if that extra feature is added. I'm a great fan of this game.",
      "Thank you genetic for the overall improvement in the game. I am writing my updated review. After the update the road texture has improved and the annoying menu decorations are gone, but the glitching is still happening, Especially in the \"city parking\" modes. The traffic cars do not have wheels on some devices. If you fix the city driving mode it would be 5 stars for sure.",
      "100% RECOMMENDED BY ME I love the new government undercover cars/suv are amazing . 3 suggestions 1] the siren buttons I don't like where you press the siren button but it doesn't stay on? 2]would recommend a button for 2 different emergency light set up and a OFF so no lights or sirens. Please make all vehicles purchaseable by Game money and after completing each sector you get gold this should happen as it's not nice for other users having to try to earn 4.000 in gold",
      "This is the best car driving game i seen ever because of these following 1. Realistic graphics 2. Realistic car interior 3. Very good sounds of the cars 4. Multiplayer mode 5. 50+ different cars But there are some problems which are these following 1. Too many lags by even using a gaming phone 2. It some time automatically crash 3. You can't play the city parking mode day Or night both smoothly because it has toooo many lags when you drive the car ⭐ So please fix these 3 problems to make it best",
      "This is an amazing game! It is really realistic and the graphics are pretty cool. I would find it cool if there could also be a mode were you just drive long distances without having to park and having to lookout for all kind of things!"

      "Excellent. You guys are awesome. Your game is absolutely legit and guess what... It taught me how to park the car in real life. Just add a little more adjustements and we're good to go.",
      "Good game but need some improvement like you should add a map in the game and there should be option for changing controls and also there should be more than5 or 6 worlds in the game",
      "Amazing Graphics and gameplay 😊😊😊😨😱 . But please add freeroam mode it can make it better. gear system is very bad make it better.😃",
      "I would have given 5 stars for the graphics, car details and the game but there are no stearing sensitivity control.. feels like the car is not in the hands of the driver.. Hence the rating.. Add it to the settings then i'll give u 5."

    "description":"Drive a selection of Awesome Vehicles, from Sedans through Sports Cars, Buses to even the most outlandish ones – a Tow Truck, a Fuel Tanker Truck and more! Explore a realistic Gas Station and the environment beyond!\r\n\r\nGAME FEATURES:\r\n▶ MASSIVE GARAGE: Now with 6 new vehicles up to a total of 13!\r\n▶ MULTIPLE MISSIONS: Drive, fill up the tank, tow other cars & park in 60 exciting missions (30 brand new!)\r\n▶ GAS IT: See how fast can you complete all the challenges and earn stars for your progress!\r\n▶ FREE TO PLAY: All the way through, no strings attached!\r\n\r\nDeveloped with fans of realistic driving and authentic car experiences in mind, Gas Station offers a unique opportunity to test your driving skills in a bunch of exciting vehicles! Variety is the name of the game here, as the cars vary in not only appearance, but – more importantly – in their performance and the way they handle!\r\n\r\nSit behind the wheel of a trusty Sedan, which after a few missions you will switch for a nimble 4x4! Don’t get too attached to it – new missions and challenges come fast and furiously, don’t leaving you much time to get overly confident or – more importantly – bored.\r\n\r\nYou will get to test drive those awesome cars and show your yearning for speed in a diverse, exciting location. Try not to spend too much time looking out the window though! You will have to be careful and mindful of the traffic and other obstacles that may stand in your way. If you aren’t you may end up in a crash!\r\n\r\nIn addition to driving you will accomplish other diverse and exciting tasks. How will you your approach to steering the car change with a heavy trailer attached? Will you be able to fit a long, heavy, unwieldy bus into narrow parking spots at the gas station? Do you have what it takes to assist other drivers that need help?\r\n\r\nBeing safe is as important as driving fast here! If you crash, you won’t be able to finish your job and earn your rewards. Those are necessary for your progress. With money earned for completing the job on time you will be able to buy additional vehicles and unlock new challenges. Of course the faster you accomplish your task, the higher the rewards.\r\n\r\nYou will have to manage speed and safety to arrive at your destination on time and without a scratch. It’s not a race, but time is definitely a factor. Don’t get crazy and you will surely find the right balance. Get on the street and start driving now!\r\n\r\nIn the hour of need you’ll be able to use additional means to help you. If you crash you can rewind time to save you from having to repeat the whole course from scratch. This way you can enjoy the realistic driving the game has to offer without replaying the levels too often!\r\n\r\nEnter our Gas Station and let it surprise and excite you! Find new ways of driving and appreciating amazing the automobiles in all their glory!",

      "This game is the apsalute worst game ever. First it takes literally 3 hours to just download the screen. Then when im on the ROAD it is so feaking glitchy that I can not even move and when I do I end up in a dich or ran into a cone or bench. And I DIE. Not to mention the game has way to many adds aka every 30 seconds. I recommend to not download this game ever. It is a wast of time.",
      "To start off with it was fun but two things are wrong. 1st some of the parking spots are too difficult to get the angle right without crashing, and second why if a car crashes into you for no reason is it your fault. Very disappointed and have uninstalled.",
      "This game is the stupidest thing ever because you have to follow the green things and if you crash you have to start fromlevel one wich is dumb and then if you log out it makes you start all over again and if you don't touch there green lines it won't stop going crazy you or your parents have to enter you private property and have to enter your email and your phone number and you even have to play with other people or you can't play the game plus the game is freaking glitchy",
      "This game is so helpful it just gets me ready to drive and park and go to the gashstation in real life 🤗",
      "I like this game but is I had to put it on a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 5. There are two things that really bother me while playing this game. The first thing is that it is super hard to drive large vehicles such as lorry or buses. This bothers me because it is hard to reverse while driving them and when there is a sharp corner, it is really difficult to succeed without crashing into something. I hope this essay😂 helps with future updates and improvements."

      "I do wish there was another way to reset the pin as well but I still love this app so far. I didn't know apps like these existed. I don't like to pull out my cards to pay at the stations and sometimes the screens don't work when it gets too cold. This is safer and keeps you out of the cold.",
      "Have used this app for several years and I never experienced a glitch. It gives me a peace of mind when I'm away from my vehicle that as long as I need to increase time on meter, I can simply add it from my location. It's wonderful!",
      "I liked the app when it actually worked but after the first withdraw, they're blaming my phone or Internet for not being able to put more funds on the app so i can actually use it."

      "This is a fun game. It helps me learn the ways of driving. Parking is fun too. It gives you a rank of how you parked. There is a line you have to pass to go to the next level. The 2 issues that I experienced were with the wheel sometimes it moves your angle instead of the wheel and you crash, and the three stars it gives you are based on time. In my opinion, I feel that you shouldn't be rushed wheras the stars should be based on how good you park.Thats why its called a parking game. :)",

But the placement of the ad below the screen keeps on interrupting me on the game because obviously you will accidentally tap it while you are steering the wheel. Its so annoying and it keeps on showing on your screen. Ugh. Disgusting. As a suggestion you can show your ads after the level is complete. No prob with that. Many apps do that.",

      "Just love the sensor steering option on this game ... (For the life of me i don't understand why Parking Mania and Parking Mania 2 dont have the sensor steering option ? ... Steering with an on screen sterring wheel is no fun at all !!!)",
      "Where's the rest of the levels!? There used to be hundreds in the original game and you could freely pick whatever level you wanted. I feel like they've just made the game worse by not changing the levels in the game and getting rid of the rest. It kinda sucks now, yes it was fun while it lasted but when I finished the 4th world I expected more. Extremely disappointed.",
      "first of all it's an amazing game. I like the feel of the original. sometimes the directions don't work very well. respond systems amazing. everything works well some suggestions would be : better directions, choice of cars, viewing of the cars, and a little better graphics. overall amazing game I can't wait to dive in and play",
      "I love Parking Mania but what i truly loved was the style and the ability to do any level you wanted at any time. it was pure freedom. so i was kinda excited when they announced the update but disappointed after i played it. i wanted something a bit similar to the old Parking Mania that kept the same base elements with little changes, then added new features to keep the game fresh. It isn't a bad game, but i dont like it.",
      "Great game! I know you just wanted to make parking mania 1 better. Also i would like this back to the game, the MUSIC from parking mania 1. I did play all of your games they are amazing! Could you aswell add a restart button please? Im getting tired of going back to the menu and then back to the level. If you already did but i didnt notice please tell! Great game tho :) 4 stars out of 5! Will change the rating if you add a restart button thank you :)"

      "I turn notifications on to get alerted when my parking is going to expire in 15 minutes. But I never get the alert. One time I got a ticket because I didn't remember to extend my parking time. Besides that it is a good app. Now I use my phone's alert. It'd be nicer if I received a notification from your app",
      "It works fine on regular meters, but not in ramps. When trying a ramp, I have a default payment method and it says i don't. I try to enter a zone manually and it won't let me. I scan the code and it tells me it doesn't look like a valid code. Kinda hard to use out of I can't enter anything!",
      "Installation is hit or miss. First install appeared to work, but could not locate it on device... Yet Web install insisted it was there. Play store indicated it existed, still couldn't locate it. Had to uninstall via Play Store. Reinstall seemed to sort of work, but no longer needed it.. so dumped the app.",
      "The app does not allow me to customize my time. It freezes and the app shuts down and turns to a black screen. Ive tried to update the app but to no avail. I have to restart my phone for the app to work again still being unable to customize my time.",
      "Garbage, like nearly every parking app I've seen. Just awful. The app has a terrible UX, and I honestly don't trust it at all with any of my data. Feels like a data grab, raking advantage of foolish government officials who don't understand the implications of contracting lowest bidders for their apps."

This game is very boring and very frustrating (for me anyways) it says you crashes when your like 2cm away from crashing and you can't watch any ad videos to rewind time and continue. Here's a top if you get frustrated very easy (like me) don't play this game at all because this game will really make you frustrated to hell that is a warning and a tip. The good reviews are lies",
