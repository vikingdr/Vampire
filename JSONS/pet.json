      "This app is the best thing I've ever used. I can't have pets at home, so through this app, I can have tons of cute, low maintenance pets that can't die. Also, the animated movement is super cute, and when I am in a bad mood, the pets on this app cheer me up. I recommend this app to basically everyone, so, yeah, that's it.",
      "I don't really have anything good to say about this game except you can, indeed, adopt screen pets and have them roam on your phone, but I've got a load of problems. The pets always leave your screen, to get cookies you either buy them or have to download games or take quizzes, and the other pets cost way too much money, or cookies. Very disappointing. Oh yah, and you gotta watch too many adds for stuff. Still, very disappointing. The game is good, though.",
      "This game is amazing! The animals are cute and lovable, and it's completely free! Although can you fix the glitch that makes it so the ads are not available? It happens every day and it's really annoying! Thanks! You should totally download this game. PS: Sooooo, I needed more space so I uninstalled this. (Yes, I did connect using Google) And, how do I restore my progress??? I don't know where or how to do it! Someone please help.",
      "I like having pets running across my screen, but that's basically it for me. Whenever I take quizzes for cookies, it allows me videos or takes me to another site when I try to click on the answer. Then I tried to do a discovery thing for cookies, and I got the app it told me to and ran our, but I didn't get any cookies. The cure animals are really the only reason I'm keeping this app. Please make better ways to get cookies.",
      "I love the pets, their unique personalities and how they appear on your home screen. But the only real way to progress through the game is to either use real money or complete ads, which usually either involve downloading other games or taking quizzes. I get that you need to earn money, but I suggest a mini game that gives you cookies instead. And my other issue is when I get on the app it takes like an hour to load and my pets are giving me hearts but I can't collect them because it's loading."

      "I love this game! Reason being: 1. Im an animal lover 2. There are so much varietys of breeds for animals 3. There are rabbits, bunnys, squirrels, snakes, fish, dogs, cats, cross breeds, A perfect place for all animal lovers! But like every other game, it has down sides. 1. You shouldn't have to buy gems, to get another nursery bed is 149 gems, im not going to waste a penny, dime, nickel, anything! For a game. Just a huge waste of money! So dont expect me to donate. Its unacceptable!!",
      "This game is awesome, I love it. My only problem is the mystery boxes, I go to the mystery boxes and they are not there. I don't know if it is the level I am on or not, but I am on level 15. And when I go into it I says I am on page 5/10. So if anyone knows this can you let me know and help me out plz.ty",
      "Although the game is fun, to get any gems is ridiculous. And SO many quests in the game require you to have gems (or buy them). There should be quests that GIVE us gems instead of us spending so much money. To open another nursery is 149 gems which would cost a player $60 CAD dollars??!!! This is unacceptable. So as I will continue to play the game, with some enjoyment, you will not receive a nickle from me, unless you reduce your prices for gems or provide quests where we are able to collect",
      "This game is so fun. Do you feel like owning a shop or just having a relaxing day instead of thinking about strategy. It also is very nice because it shows you a bit about having your own shop. Tho I do think it is for *ages 8 and up* due to big words. Lots of FUN. please add activities to do with the pets perhaps 😄💓OVERALL LOVE IT",
      "This game is great! It has so many things to do and your options are endless!!! You can buy tons of different types of animals and take care of them. They are so cute, and you can even crossbreed! Expand your shop, complete goals, send gifts, level up, all towards being a five star pet shop!!! Totally love this game!!!! 😀😀"

      "Okay I love this app. I love the layout, I love that even though they have my email address they don't email me a thousand times a day like most companies, I love everything about it except that it has started deleting all my saved/passed pets. It's like every time I open the app I'm a brand new account and it explains how to use the app. Obviously that bug is extremely frustrating and kind of ruins the app.",
      "I love the app but hate the functional issues with account profile. I've linked to my Google profile multiple times due to the app logging me out. I lose all favorites and history of pet centers I've inquired with when this happens. Additionally if I utilize the site from a non mobile device and utilize my Google account, they still do not sync with mobile Google sign on.",
      "It helps me dream, it helps me find pets I couldn't do on my own or with fb or any other site really. It's great for exploring options not normally available. If you don't like this app, suggest a better one or design one yourself to give away freely or even charge money to use it. Fake reviews hurt this good rescue apps ratings. 5 stars puppy mill troll haters.. hahaha",
      "I like the way the site is set up easy to look for what you want. With one exception. The search option for 500 miles was taken away and has been replaced with Anywhere, which doesn't allow for a extended search from your location. And pulls up pets from areas that are not within driving range.",
      "Wont keep my favorites saved, says it doesnt have permission to access my gallery even though it does, froze okn me a few times, wont let me select mixed breeds, I have to put in my location even though I'm fine looking at animals all over the US. I just want to help share some of these dogs to get them adopted, but it's hard to do if the app constantly has issues"

      "Been playing for a long time... Years. Love it usually. Then I had to buy buy buy and take days to get past the last few levels only to be told there are no new levels. Update please. I feel robbed. Also the driver box keeps changing. Keep the packages the same. As others have said too many block levels. I am really annoyed 😡.",
      "This game is much too difficult. It sets you up to fail in order to get you to spend money for extended turns and buy aps so that you can succeed. A lot of the time it doesn't even display how many moves you have left. It wastes time on races that always end just before you reach the finish . It offers alternate races that just waste time and aps. It is so frustrating that it takes away all the fun. I uninstalled it a few months ago. I thought I'd give it another chance, but nothing has improved",
      "I enjoy this game very much and have played it a long time. The opportunities for improvement are that the games could be solved with ingenuity and not with luck or busters some times. Also it would be great to be able to transfer busters from a phone to another one. It is good that you can transfer gold bars and silver coins. Many thanks to the developers for an enjoyable game",
      "I wish there was zero stars, this game is riddled with levels that are full of glitches or designed so that the players has to play over and over again eg 1464 took 35 tries because the bombs won't drop. Most levels are okay, then they are levels where you can play but no pets or not enough pets will drop. Contacted the developer and was told to watch a video, yep like that would help when the scenario is not the same. I am done at 1498, can't get more than 4 of the 5 pets to drop.",
      "I love this game and have been playing for years, but the 100% of block boards are annoying to say the least. I play other puzzle games and understand the challenge involved, but I play \"pet rescue\" for the challenge of rescuing pets. Having to clear 100% of the blocks 5 levels in a row misses the whole point and takes the fun out of the concept of the game in my opinion! Again I realize the challenge involved but I think it diminishes the game as a whole."

      "I love this game but iv'e been having a problem with it. I'll play the game perfectly fine, but after closing once, when I try to play it again, it just says something like i think: love.boot or something. Love the game when i can play it though. Super cute graphics. My favorite pet is the dragon. When I saw one I was shocked. Love the game, will give five star reveiw when that is fixed. Thanks!",
      "This game is so adorable!!🙀🐕😻 As you get farther in the game, it can really keep you on your toes. But I like it, it's a lot of fun! The pets are extremely cute and the simple design just makes me happy. Very entertaining for me.😀",
      "The game was fun at first. later on into the game to many pets want the same thing when you only have 1 of the item that they need and the pets lose patience way to fast also there's way to many ads after every level that's to many ads do it after every 5 lvls also I have to keep spending my diamonds on the upgrades bc the ads don't skip them the barn is way to much for a beginner of the game 50 diamonds is way to much and the minigame is stupid and waste time I don't recommend this game at all",
      "You can't upgrade what you need, only what it tells you to. So your customer rating goes down. Instead of upgrade let us choose to ADD what is needed or upgrade such as another vet table, because more requests for vet, but game wants tub upgrade? Game is cute, love the animals, graphics and controls very nice, and speed of picking up pets is great! LOVED poking the fleas!! The sounds are so cute.",
      "I love this game its really,really good thank you for making good effort on the game!😍😀😁😃😉Edit: Please add more pet shops like: unicorn dragon any legendary animals etc. Edit: ITS SO SLOW NOW I CANT EVEN PLAY ITS STUCK ON THE DAILY REWARD SCREEN >:("

      "The game is very fun. I have a few complaints. First of all you can't change the bios name like promised. You can only add on letters and if you make a mistake it won't let you remove the letters. Also if u go \"outside\" all the other people can say stuff but you can't. Me and my sister try clicking the door at the same time but no matter what we can't see each other. I also had to turn off notifications because every time I try to watch a video it gives me notifications. Please fix these.",
      "I love this game, its adorible and funny. I love how it helps you a little with money when you first download it, its a great game i didnt see any flaws in it exept it lagged for a few seconds one time. But this got fixed for me and now it dosent lag. It dosent drain your battery. And dosent take all your wifi and data. Again one of the best games! I love it",
      "I have sooo many thing to say.. First of all, Your Boo only has energy to last 25 minutes! I think the energy should last about 40-45 minutes. Second of all, You gotta add more categories and clothing. Just advice for anyone planning to get the game.. DON'T.",
      "This game is horrible for android devices!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have any kind of android device, DONT DOWNLOAD THE GAME!!!!! it doesn't finish loading. It gets to the agreement part, then loads the game, then just goes back to the home screen. Reading the reviews, i thought it would be a cute and fun game to play!! But NO I didn't even get the chance to play it and see what it was about, see if it was fun, or see if I would like the game, CAUSE I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO PLAY!!!!",
      "I love this app. This app has some flaws though. I can't change my boos name and there are just a bit to many adds. I use to have this app on IOS.I also had boo town to go with it so when I found out Android doesn't have it I was disappointed. You don't need to purchase anything with real money to get coins you just need to play. If the app makers see this please add boo town to Android I would love that it would me so much to me.But this is an over all good app.Hope this review helped you out."

      "The game claims to have over 60 different breeds (false), there are less than 30. However each breed comes in it's own variety of colors. Just dont see why you gotta lie like that... also there's some glitching when the dogs walk into furniture. Like they start having siezures... and a glitch where if you start making food, you can upgrade your oven at any point and all the food and coins you spent are lost. That last one sucks a lot.",
      "This game gives brings me right back to childhood when I use to play Nintendogs everywhere I went, it's graphics are quite impressive for a Unity game. My only critercism is that the membership price is quite expensive however, the game is completely playable and just as fun without it.",
      "It's seems nice. But I did NOT like having to breed PUPPIES! At least you should allow that function once the dog is fully grown into an adult dog. It was sick to breed two puppies and that is why I have deleted the game.",
      "This game is so fun! Easily my favorite on my phone. The dogs are realistic and cute, the currency isn't too hard to obtain, and you aren't forced to make micropurchases. It's a nice refresher from the usual simulator games. The one reason that I'm knocking off a star is that VIP is way overpriced. $9.99 maybe makes sense for a month, but for a week? Definitely not worth it. Overall, this game is fantastic and I look forward to future updates!",
      "This game is so fun and cute i'm a dog lover but can you add a dog called alaskan he/she is big kinda like a husky but it's big so pls add him/her and add a back yard so they can play that will be so awsome and maybe dog clothings pls add them and make the game more fun!"

      "5 stars all the way. This game is incredible. It is super addicting. I play it all the time. Purchases are all optional-- this is not a pay to win game as many reviews say. The graphics are incredible! Sometimes you can see glitches in the animals when they're moving, but it's not often. The enclosures are creative and fairly easy to level up. The food and treats are pretty expensive, but you can get lots of coins for hosting animals. All in all, this is an awesome game!! New favorite!",
      "I love this game so so much it is really nice, there is a bunch of diffrent animals to take care of level's are easy but so much fun to play. It's a nice and simple game because i'm not a person who is into complacated games or apps. I've had this game for 2 years on my phone and i still love it! The best part is there are not alot of ads at all and that's really nice! Also it is very giving there is food and treats around the farm which is nice, and everything is FREE! I love it so much!",
      "It's a really fun game but there's alot of adds and i really wanted to unlock the cat pen but it was alot of coins and i couldn't get that many between feeding costs and treat costs.(the treats are sooo expsensive they cost more than the food!) but the wheel and free snacks/food help but it would be better if they gave you more food for the animals you've unlocked intsead of the alot of food for the ones that you haven't unlocked. Also, up -grading the animal pens cost alot. It's fun though!!!!!",
      "Tivola is probably the best creators to make animal games and games ect. And I have most of their games, the graphics are ALWAYS amazing, it's pretty realistic, and sometimes I know there can be glitches, but it's not often at all!! Tivola, I'm sorry for all the hate you've been getting..But I support you!! And I totally recommend this app if you love animals!!",
      "I remember I got this game 3 or so years ago and let me tell you something, it was SOOOO boring. You could only take care of dogs and cats. I got this game after so long, and when I saw the features, I was in awe. That was literally the craziest thing I've ever seen in a game! I'm so happy that their is a wide variety of things to do unlike the old version. Thank you so much for making my day!"

      "Great game but it would be nice if it could be made a little more realistic. You usually don't just have one axolotl per tank so it would be cool if you could have at least 2. It would be nice if there were more things to do but I do get that it's supposed to a simple game! Could you add like tank customization too I think that would be very cool. Over all good job thanks!",
      "It's very therapeutic, but it would be nice to have a play or pet option. For a play option, you could drop small rings into the water and have the Axolotl swim through them. It'd be good exercise for it as well. EDIT: My Axolotl just died. I'm a pretty forgetful person, so it'd be nice to have a feature in the app where you can set a notification for a set time to remind you to check on your Axolotl.",
      "Absolutely beautiful game. This is the game that made me want to get into marine biolog and is a great way to soothe yourself if your mad. The axolotl itself is one of the cutest things I've ever seen and is cuter than any dog I have ever seen. Thank you for making this game exist in general.",
      "I love it :) Axolotls are so cute, easy to take care of. Not sure why everyone complains about so many adds, I hardly get any. I think a tank customization option would be a neat thing to add. I also think it would be so much more satisfying and soothing if when you clean the tank you could do it with your finger and watch the gunk get wiped away. Not much to the app, but that's what makes it so great :)",
      "I would have fun with this app if it weren't for all the work. I had to tell check my phone everyday to feed this axolotl that's supposed to be my digital pet. 20 days later. ~Your axolotl might die, go feed It. I check, it's dead. I am so affected by this. I only fed it and cleaned it, why not there's nothing else to do with it. It's not playful, the tank looks boring. I got another axolotl... 50 days later; your axolotl passed away. This gave me so much anxiety, please stop killing my axolotl."

      "This is an amazing game, but, the thing is.. there are always scammers in every corner of Jamaa. You can never escape them! I just got scammed from my own buddy earlier! I lost my Blackout wings, Blackout stylish glasses, and a whole lot more! I have reported, but my items are still scammed. Why can't I get my items back?? Can't you gift them back to me somehow?? Please try and do that, I worked hard to get those items. Thanks! -Coolbuddydog17",
      "I really love this game!,when i started out I was so amazed of how the game was, It was like my own world, but I do wish the game could add more stuff, I'm not saying it's bad and it needs to be added I'm just saying it to be more..Idk? Well here's somethings I want the game to add, more animals, ferrets, weres the dog, and weres the cat?Also I want them to add were you can see how meany people are in a place, and....well that's all I got, but over all i really love this game,I cant stop playing",
      "I Love this game!! I play it with my sister, cousin, and BFF! My only BIG problem with the game is that it crashes ALOT! But I love it! It is kinda like Minecraft, well... Not really, but anyways please fix some bugs but that's all I have too say for now... Wait! One. More thing! Please make it were you can play Animal Jam on iPads and iPhones. Even tho Animal Jam is a whole nother game it's still made by y'all, Wildworks.",
      "So this app is pretty dope .But here is why i rated it a four stars... ITS GLITCHY it takes time to load. One time i wanted to play after it was done loading it just turned black! For me to play the game properly i had to turn it off open it and go back to the game. I also have something else to say about the game there is sooo much players! Once i went to the wolves only place and it was crowded. Everywhere you see are just wolves and a bunch of names. So developer of animal jam please fix it",
      "This game is fun! But what is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE (why I'm giving 2 stars) about this game is that it crashes EVERY. TIME. I TRY. TO PLAY THIS GAME. Edit: I changed this rating to 4 stars. I am still a little disappointed because it keeps logging me out and saying: \"You were gone for too long and got logged out!\" when I'm literally right there, still playing. This game must've took a long time to make, so I don't blame you. But you made so many more updates that the bug is getting worse!"

      "This game is ok, but gets boring pretty fast. I don't like that you only get 3 types of animals to start off with then you have to buy the rest! I earn coins, but it took me 3 days to get 100! I really don't like that part! It would be ok if it was 15 coins, instead of 300! I don't think I would download this game again!",
      "The game is fun, a bit repetitive, yes but still enjoyable. However, I do miss parts from the old game, like having to go and collect the water, things for the animals and treats. And the people arriving randomly, not all at once. Other than that, great game!",
      "This is a fun game, but I absolutely HATE how you can only raise the animals that you buy with data. Like, I bought reptiles and squirrels and I couldn't get access to them without turning my data on. That is ridiculous. Other than that, it's a fun game to play.",
      "This game is really fun and I love it a lot. But one part I really think can improve is when l buy the new animals. I really hope the purchase lasts forever even if it means it becomes more expensive.",
      "I think its a fun game and all i love it alot. But the reason why i didnt give it a ful star was because you dont get to keep the animals and it takes for ever to get coins to get new animals."

      "It is an absolute fanomanol game! I own Littlest Pet Shop (LPS) toys myself! The game is great, but there is a bug that NEEDS to be fixed as it is important. After you are able to buy animals like the Boston Terrier and Daschund on your quests (it tells you to buy those pets) None of the animals want feeding, bathing or play time... it says they will want to in 11 hours.... I come back the next day, once again wait 11 hours.. on rare occasions it does let me play with them, PLEASE FIX",
      "There is no confirmation to buy something I turned on the game and it opened up in the shop and as I went to leave my finger must have touch one of the items and the item was purchased by mistake. In this case it was an item worth 145 gems! It took me forever to collect all those gems and because of one accidental touch they were all gone :( I'd appreciate if the developer gave me those gems back. Take back the house that was accidentally bought that I didn't eve want. I am user 404bcad",
      "Personally I think the littlest pet shop app is really fun I get to play with the pets in real life I've been playing this app since I was about the age of 3 it's really fun you get the feed pets you get to play with the pets some of the stuff does cost real money in says hey this cost real money so that way they realize we don't want by that so I really suggest on getting the app if you have a kid at home who loves littlest pet and it's really family-friendly I am 12 years old and I love it",
      "I used to have this app on my old phone. It was amazing! One of my favorite apps actually. I decided to download it on my new phone! I was so excited, I couldn't wait to play! It finally downloaded. I opened it. It brought me to my home screen and said unfortanulatly this game has stopped. So I opened it again, several times. It didn't work! I reseted my phone. It still didn't work! I was upset! Fix this bug, please! I know you won't though cause you don't fix any of them! Think about us! Please",
      "Hello there gameloft! I think this game is awesome and really fun to play! But about 1 day ago I was scrolling through the shop... I had 94 diamonds and I touched the the button that made my buy the ferret and it was on accident 😢 Please fix this... why can't it just say \"are you sure you wanna buy this?\" It took me three weeks to get 94 diamonds 😢😢 Thank You! Have a great day!"

      "I enjot this app, however it has moment every once in a few hours where it will freeze up and not allow me to touch anywhere but the game timer will continue. The graphics are clean and the cors are saturated. The objective is clear and I appreicate that the developers included a side objective of collecting pets. The game also frequently allows you to earn more energy without having to wait time to actually recieve it. Diamonds however aren't awarded enough tho.",
      "I really appreciate the opportunity to play something really adorable and cute. It is really enjoyable for you to be happy while playing it on any mobile u can find only if it's not one of those buttons one . The ones u can scroll up and down with your fingers. And u can play it on your computer and the laptop.",
      "I really like this game a lot as it's fun and keeps you on your toes all the time. The only thing I would suggest that would make this game better is making the 'pet finding' go faster because the first time it only takes 2 mins but then the next time it takes 30 mins. I think if the time was 2 mins the entire way through it would be good. The money increasing each time is fine but it's just the time I really don't like.",
      "I think this app is great ,but sometimes when youre playing not enough pets will come in ,and a lot of the upgrades go from not costing too much to costing a bunch I think they should fix that.",
      "I really enjoy this game. It's a fun game that helps to relieve stress. Plus I dont have to pay to play which is always a bonus for me. They have great deals for those who like to pay."

      "I really love Happy Pet Story! There is always something to do, and you can never get bored of it! It is also love collecting event items! But, I don't like how you have to tap to move the screen. I would like to move the screen, without having to control my character at the same time. by far, one of my favorite games to play. I Love It so much! The graphics, interaction, everything! This game is extremely cute and lovely! I really suggest you this game, If you're childish/childlike",
      "I just installed this yesterday and am hooked but 2 things I'd like to inquire: 1. Why does my item/furniture disappear from my slot and from the room when I accidentally pinch the item while trying to put it in my room? Is this a glitch? Where do the items go? 2. The quest to find items from different townies' furniture shop, I've searched through dozens of random townies' furniture shops but it's almost like nobody sells them, can you make the items available more often?",
      "I love it. Just love it. Why do people hate it? Its a good game for every ages from kids to adults! I love doing tasks and sometimes I am kinda bored just running and eating. Hope you can add more tasks! Hope you reply. Oh and I got ideas! Can you make the control a little better? Its kinda weird to tap to walk. Anyways. My name is Bun OwO and a grey cat. Hope someone visit me! Thank you! •3• OwO Oh and. If you a childish(no offence) then this game is for you UwU",
      "I enjoy the game but it's not really that fun. All you do is running around doing tasks for the citizens of who knows where! Yes, I do sound rude but when there is no tasks and nothing in the shops look good, what are you going to do?! I know you can do fishing, visit friends and redecorate your room but I'm not sure that everyone will enjoy doing that every time there's nothing to do. Just take note. It is a good game 😊",

      "Really great app to help keep up with medication, grooming, feeding, etc for your pet. Gives you a direct contact with your vet for appointments and reminders. It reminded me that my dogs were due for some very serious vaccinations about a week before they were due so I had time to schedule appointment and prepare for the cost of vaccines. You can also do this with a groomer.",
      "When the vet uses it consistently to send your updates to, it's literally the greatest thing ever. I didn't even realized what it did until it alerted me of a scheduled appointment as well as notes about what my dog was prescribed. Seriously amazing to have such a handy app to track everything for me. I forget names of medicines or when i last got something for my pets so this helps so much. I even see old vet info from before I even had the app. I hope all future vets I visit use this.",
      "Enjoyable savings! The points system on this app saved me a big bundle in the annual visit for both my cats! I was able to put my savings towards paying for the vaccines. The next time I use my points will be going to words a dental for one of my cats.",
      "Absolutely love this app! So many great features to help remind and manage all of your pets needs! So thankful my Vet's office recommended this to me!",
      "Useful, but not intuitive. Whenever I need to make an appointment I got to the appointment tab, it just makes sense. Instead you need to go to the providers tab and click the request appt there. It didn't really stand out, which is why I never remember where it is. The app design is clunky and unclean."

      "Possible to play/ get everything without paying & no ads! I really enjoy this game, super cute art, with elements of different kinds of games in the filling quests, the combining things in alchemy, and tapping mini games. The only thing is that I did have to look some stuff up in the community forums, like recipes and how to get certain pets (but nbd imo) One thing I'd like to see is for the recipe book, when you discover a recipe, it'd be helpful to see what combinations you used to get it.",
      "This game is AMAZING. Very cute graphics! I like the fact you have to keep checking up on it. I think that this app does need maybe some improvements,like adding more activities. Rather than that I recommend this app for all ages,genders,ext. The mini games they have definitely are good games to pass time! Edit: Very upset the bus stop botton has disappeared. Please fix now.",
      "I love this game, and I've been dying to find a game my style, and it is! I used to have a tamogatchi and it'd just like this but with a bunch of different things. Things like quests and mini games. You can even make your own village. This game is amazing and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes cute things",
      "There are so many things to do like evolve your pet, do quests, combine ingredients, decorate your home and outside your home, upgrade the level of your town and create a good community with lots of pakka pets. Im addicted!",
      "Lovely but some flaws. I really love this game! It's like tamagotchi and a little bit of animal crossing. Customizing your home and a village is really nice, but I wish I could zoom out from the village to place everything better. And the movie ticket game is really difficult to control, when I hold the phone normally and horizontal the pet would always walk towards the left even tho it's just straight horizontal. I wish it was kinda easier to realize what care gives you a different pet."

      "Quite good! But please add some more daily activities to the app, or clubhouse access. Unable to access a computer. When I log in I get todays events popup but can't actually get/do 75%. Seeing all the free magic forest or spree plays I could be getting and the events or free items at the clubhouse make the app feel like a significantly lesser experience than online. That said, I still enjoy the app and it is quite new. Looking forward to updates in the future.",
      "Theres no point in playing anymore, you need the deluxe membership for almost everything. Even to send your friends gifts you need the deluxe member ship. It's sad. I'm not going to bother anymore. You apps have major problems too. They freeze alot and you lose alot and the quests dont register. Save your time and money guys. It used to be amazing now I think you dont care and it's about the money.",
      "If you could please add more activities on the mobile app, that would be great! I can't always get on the computer to play so sometimes I rely on the webkinz app, except there isn't much to do on the mobile app compared to desktop! Please add more and different games and activities. And make go fish and the other mini games available to play on the phone app too! Thank you! Love webkinz!",
      "The game is fun but I now have numouse accounts that I can't even get into and so I can't play with my webkin anymore and it takes way to long to load some times it even thakes 15 minis it's fun but because all theses problems I don't know if I should keep it or uninstall it.",
      "I love webkinz it was my childhood and I was so excited to download and play it, but most of the arcade games don't work including my favorites. I only am able to play three arcade games. Also, it keeps glitching on my computer and I have had to delete it and redownload it multiple times because once it's frozen no matter how many times I close and reopen the app it is still stuck on the same thing."

      "Since they created the city for the pets, this game became more adictive than ever! It's beautiful and gives a lot of room for personalisation. However, I would like to have access to the pets (feed them, change their outfits etc.) from the scrapbook instead of the city itself, because, being so small, I find it hard to pick the right one. I'd also love to have Fern again opening the box to get a new pet and introducing them to us, that used to be my favourite part of the game!",
      "Very buggy. Can't sign into my King account (it shows the sign-in screen, but nothing happens when you type), and there's no way to get back to the home screen after finishing a game without closing the app and reopening it. I'm deleting the app after 10 minutes, very disappointing.",
      "Why do I love this game? Simple..they don't bug you to purchase, they let you relax and win, and it can still be moderately challenging. It's my first game that doesn't constantly bug you to purchase..thanks a bunch developers. Sometimes a person doesn't want so many big challenges...your game is fun...thanks",
      "A fun game to play that doesnt take too much energy. I like that i can play it either waking up or while settling down for bed. Its intriguing enough and has several types of puzzles and it doesnt put too much pressure on how fast i choose to play the game. 5 stars for sure!",
      "Update done and i was building up my city instead of having the house. It was so much nicer with claiming extra lives to have one option and not have to search through all pets to care for them. Today, i got the option to connect to Facebook which i did. Once i did, the game reverted back to the old style (house and searching for each pet needing care)"

      "I think it's both the app and the store I'm finding trouble with every time I go there to purchase. One item had 32 reviews. I never buy anything without reading reviews.. Click on reviews and it's blank. Tried a different browser, again blank. Tried purchasing this item, cant get it in any store within 35 miles of me. Try getting it shipped, it's out of stock! This happens so many times with Petco. I go to Amazon, it's available from 3rd party seller...Petco! Ridiculous!",
      "So convenient and easy to use. I used to have issues using the website with searching items and lagging times on the search. Installed the app and it's so much faster, rewards upload instantly and promos automatically applied to my orders. I LOVE THIS APP!",
      "I always seen to have problems working with the repeat delivery function when I pause or unpause auto delivery. Also, I tried to schedule a grooming appointment for my dog on the app but every day and says \"0 availibilty\". I spoke to the store and they had tons of openings for those days. I booked over the phone but decided to check the app to see if anything changed. It had! Some of the days now listed the same openings as the groomer had while some still said zero when there were openings.",
      "Not much better than just using their website. Save your storage. Doesn't even save what's in your shopping cart. Added a bunch of stuff. Went to bed and cart was empty. Cart needs to cached.",
      "App appears to work well. But I am unable to upload pictures of our pets from my phone unless it was recently taken. Need a way to access albums to upload pictures."

      "Amazing. Ialready have like 10 smolsies and 2 eggs making it 12. I love this game. Its different from all the other games ive played. They interact with eachother, widen their eyes if they are hungry and half close their eyes when they are sleepy. It also shows how long it takes for the egs to hatch. If there had been lesser ads, it would have been perfect. Congrats on making this game great. I hope you all enjoy this game.😊",
      "I loved playing this game but there are a few drawbacks. First, the eggs take a really long time to hatch when you get in the higher levels so when I got my rainbow egg it took me 3 whole days until it was ready to hatch. Then the games can get boring like the basketball game after you get all the trophies you basically can't play it anymore and the jumping game cat get annoying. When you are in the higher levels there are invisable ones that get annoying.But over all it is a great game.",
      "Love the game and I got all the animals, so I went back on and all my animals were gone! please help me! But I get the hats back when the animals hatch but every time I open app they are gone, and it's really frustrating. I took a break while one of the eggs were hatching all of them, GONE! Please help me fix this glitch or whatever is happening",
      "I love this app so much When I am stuck doing nothing I just play this and for more than expected. So good and it is ok as all of the adverts that show, there is not many of, are all in my age range and I get to play games I just wish that the eggs can stop taking about 6 hours to hatch if you play the game for so long...😊",
      "I love this game. It is super fun and you can kill a lot of time. One thing is I wish there was more games to play. I also love all the cute animals such as ; HORSE UNICORN DRAGON PANDA DOG CAT HAMSTER AND REINDEER. It is an amazing game and I try to use all of my time to play it. The creator who made this game is a genius and this game is my favorite game that is why I rated it five stars."

      "I got this to replace the late Tap Pet Hotel. Its the same concept I guess. Sadly, this one has a bit of a weird system. You collect pets from your rooms to sell in the shop, but you also need to trade those pets in order to upgrade your decorative rooms (like why should I be inclined to trade 250 cats for a room that has zero perks and takes up a $#!+ ton of space?). But thats all the main quests consist of so I guess thats what to do... Just doesnt suite my wants/needs.",
      "its a good game but when you get certain animals it takes forever for them to be ready for sale (example: rabbits take 15 mins) so i dont think i could keep this game. it you want a good game simalar to this Id recommend dragon city. it only takes a long time when it is important in dragom city so id reccomend it if your anything like me uwu",

      "I've used Chewy for years now and I've never had a bad experience. I use Chewy for food, prescriptions, toys, treats, literally everything for my cats and dogs. I've had to call or email a few times with questions and they were always helpful and nice. Every year they send birthday and holiday cards. They even mailed me a portrait of my dog! I love them so much.",
      "I love how easy this is to use. Also the amount you have to spend to get free shipping is very easy to hit. The auto ship is another great feature and the fact that you can postpone a shipment or request it sooner makes it very easy to use and adjust to your and your pets schedule.",
      "The app is just as good as the company absolutely amazing, the app is very easy to use and navigate me and my dad never had any issues aside from one time two damaged products came in and the issue was resolved as fast as reported and we were given free replacements I highly suggest this app to any pet owner as it's faster, cheaper and easier then driving out to the stores to search for one specific product along with discovering new ones all in all 10/10 do recommend <3",
      "I love this app so much! It's so easy for me to order things for my fubabies especially since I'm always at work. Not only do they offer 2 day shipping they have great customers service! They wrote to my dog daisy a handwritten letter before her passing. Amazing app, and amazing customer care! 10/10 would recommend!",
      "I have always loved the convenience of Chewy, now more than ever. I got all my shopping done, and didn't have to endure the corona-craziness. I would like to see more coupons in general from the site, you get lured in with the 30% off and then you're lucky if you get 10% off after. I dont want to spend $50 to get free shipping every time so a better percentage off would absolutely encourage me to shop with Chewy more than three times a year (my average # of orders right now)."

      "The game is working again. However, if your kid has a \"family account\" it will not save their progress. So if the game gets deleted by accident or if they want to play it on a different device they have to start all over. We downloaded Google play games but it said it doesn't work for her account. So she has to start over because I deleted the game in an effort to get it working when it wasn't loading. =( Imagine a very bored, very angry/sad, very self quarantined 9yo girl who loves pets. =(",
      "Cute but buggy. I often go in and out of the game because sometimes things that I can click (like my pets) can no longer be clicked, says the pet is on waypoint when they're not, gift balloon has been stuck in the air and unable to click with action, etc. Uninstalled for the inconvenience, but cute game.",
      "I really like the game but it's so laggy. Having to wait seconds for something to happen is very annoying, besides that it's a battery killer. You can't close the game without your phone completely shutting down... Wish it wouldn't have such problems cause I enjoyed it a lot",
      "this is a really cute game. ive had no issues with it. not used to the somewhat fast pace of it, but it just makes it more fun. the animals are adorable and i enjoy the characters. cant wait to see more",
      "Overall it is a fun game. There is quite a bit you can do... Even after the first 10 minutes of playing. The ads are kinda annoying, but they don't seem to limit what you can do in the game."

      "This is a really cute game, though I feel there are some improvements that could be made here. Your pets should interact with each other and fill up each others play meter The visual upgrades should be more than visual, and actual improve the item's effectiveness I like that you can add other decor but there should be some kind of reward if your pet interacts with it Some other way to earn gems other than watching an ad for a single gem eg acheivements (cheapest thing you can buy is 200 gems)",
      "This game needs a build mode so you can stop accidently storing things. Also, it needs a pet dashboard so you can easily see the status of all pets at once. This clicking around is super tedious. The game is not very idle at all. In fact, you shouldn't leave it open because you have to be alert to get the fleas that prey on your pets. It's a bit stressful, actually.",
      "I think it's a very good game to pass the time and its enjoyable,but sometimes it does get confusing at times,I got the panda from the daily gift,and it made my pets resources stay in place,but i cant earn money of energy,and I cant really heal any of them,I dont know if this is supposed to happen,but I dont think thats a very good mechanic of the game",
      "Adorable! Although, theres really no reason to put a food and water meter if your pet eats and drinks on its own, could you possibly make it to where you can make your pet eat when \"you\" want to? And when the dog goes for a walk maybe you can make it where we can play as the dog and play with other people outside? Besides that the game is fun and really really adorable.",
      "I started playing this game since yesterday and it has been great. However, while playing this morning, my pet froze out of nowhere. I had to delete and redownload the game. After doing that, my pet froze again. I really like this game do it is sad I have to possibly stop playing until the problem is fixed."

      "Okay...I got the update with the mustangs and otters. However, once I bought the mustang expansion, you could hear their hoofbeats throughout the whole park. I don't think thats supposed to happen because none of the other animals are like that. I need a bug fix please. And also, apart from the hoofbeat thing, there is no sound in the mustang enclosure. I urgently need a bug fix please!!! Other than that the game is great",
      "It would be a very cute game, except, you only ever get squirrels and skunks. You actually have to buy, with real cash, any other animal besides them! It's a joke and a scam! It becomes extremely boring with only squirrels and skunks. Nothing new! Don't download, it's a waste of time and space unless you plan on opening your wallet! Shame on you game developers!",
      "Its it a fun little almost mindless game but progression takes a long time and if you want to get more animals and dont want to use real money you really have to work at the game. So in a sense I would not recommend this as a children's game unless you have strict purchasing policies set on your phone. So as an improvement make it easier to progress through the game.",
      "The graphics are excellent and the game is nice. I understand that you can buy more animals in the game. However I feel like you should offer more animals for free and possibly add some more animals for purchase even because this would make the game even better and more enjoyable! That is why I am giving it only 3 stars. Otherwise it's a fun and great game!",
      "You earn very little money super slow. I'm on day 65 and only unlocked the two cheapest animals. The ads aren't a problem because you can just back out of them or just watch them just 5 seconds anyways. I love everything about this game except earning money takes an EXTREMELY long time."

      "This game is cool, i'm feeling like having a real dog. But i have problems: i can't use the microphone to talk to my dog and to play language game. I also found that it's boring to see that the dog does nothing except laying down and looking at the player. It would be more entertaining if the dog can do anything else, like sniffing, asking for attention, barking, etc. And for the petting, it would look better if the dog could show different reactions.",
      "I love this app! I've been dying for a dog and this has fulfilled my wish! It's my dream breed to! My dog's name is Tommy and I love him a lot! :) I have a suggestion that you could make a dog park, where other peoples dogs could meet and they could talk and that when we get them first, they could be babies, and we could grow them 💖",
      "It's very cute! I would reccomend to any kids who want a pet without responsibility I only have one problem I gave 4 star though even if it's not a big deal But it doesn't understand my voice It always says \"who are you\" over and over again Please fix this bug",
      "I wish i have a real pet .But its still ok becuse theres an app like this.But theres a big problem.I cannot instal the game maybe from the wi-fi. I thout are wi-fi is fast and the name are wi-fi is PLDT. So i have another problem if i use the microphone and then if i say you are my best friend or dog it dosent work only i love you.o==[]::::::::::::::::>",
      "So, I was so happy when it installed then I opened it and it was to creepy then after about a minute I uninstalled it do not get this game if you don't want to be freaked out. I love animals but this is not ok at all. Edit: It must have been a bug because after you responded to me I installed it again and it was just fine so sorry this is a five star game."

      "I really enjoy this game. I like that you don't have to wait for energy to regenerate to play or have to rely on friends sending you gifts to complete tasks. This is also the first game I've played where watching ads is optional AND you get rewarded with 3 diamonds each time you do watch an ad. My only concern is what happens after I buy and upgrade all treatment rooms, unlock all animals, and fully decorate? What will be left to do?",
      "It's a great game. I cant stop playing. 😍all my RESPONSIBILITIES jumps out the window when I play this game. If you short some diamond or coins you can always watch a couple of ads and you can carry on. I LOVE THIS GAME. GREAT WORK GUYS. KEEPS UP THE GREAT WORK",
      "It is a good game but just a little bit boring at some times because the same animals keep coming in. Also when you have to pet an animal it makes you do it for ages.",
      "This is my favorite game of all time. I definitely recommend if u like games that let u do things by yourself and run things 10/10.",
      "Very addicting game. It's very simple not timed. It is easy to pass a lot of time playing this game without even realizing it."

It takes a long time for Shibo to sleep but other than that it's a super cute game and while your off your phone it gets dirty or hungry or sleepy like a real dog would and the mini games are quite fun as well . It sends notifications when he is done sleeping so you don't have to keep checking your phone to see if he is done. Cool game download it.",
      "Cute, but constantly crashes. Any time I try to play a game, the screen goes black and I have to restart it. Even if I complete the game, I'm never granted the rewards. It is frustrating because I cannot progress.",
      "Cute but his energy goes down too fast and builds up way too slow. Also, it won't let me use my nicknames even though they're between 4 to 12 characters. The passwords too. Other than those, the game is nice and cute. Needs more hair options and clothes/accessories.",
      "This is a very fun and cute game! I love that u can decorate ur home,dress up ur dog,and play mini games. The only 2 things i wish was differebt where the fact that u need to pay real money to get skins i also wish u can name the dog ur self but besides that its a pretty good game its worth downloading!",

      "Very fun game! Good graphics! Even better game then pixel pets and animaljam! I enjoy this game alot and highly recommend it. Many species of cat and dog, which makes it a lot funner! You can also breed the cats/dogs, but they must be a diffrent gender. Not very many ads suprisigly. One thing is wrong though. I don't like the fact that you have to wait for the baby after breeding. There out a couple of days after mating, but 6 minutes isn't the next day. That's the only problem. Overall, 5 stars",
      "Cute concept but the game keeps crashing and unlike Bird Paradise you dont get the bones you need when you complete goals. Also, the game kept crashing every time I would try and go to friends levels.",

      "It is a cool game, but it keeps on crashing for me after a few seconds of opening it. I'm just wondering if it is at all possible to fix this, thank you."

      "My derp is a really interesting game its not like all those other pet games were you its just eat play sleep keep playing 😠. Instead derp makes it completely different, its a race to see how long you can keep him alive. And its awesome. My only problem is with the item select in the bottom if you either put on the side or above it would be pretty nice then i would give it 5 stars.",
      "quick, entertaining, not what I expected, love it! it's a short speed game. get tokens, buy what he needs, get tokens, oh no I forgot to feed him, get tokens, wait i don't have the money for his medicine, get tokens, please just one more jump for the last token for the medicine, oozing blob on the floor dies... UGH, ok let me try JUST ONE MORE TIME... an hour later.... a week later.... an eternity later.... just one more try!",
      "I love it!! But it would be better if you get 10 DerpCoins per jump and also replace the skull with a red DerpJewel wich means you're health goes down 5% faster and pls make petting the derp not get sick too, thank you!! Btw add minigames where one like the derp has to avoid the mosquitos for enough time that you earn 400 coins (it has to be a hour before you can get this much, basically 200 each half hour) and sorry this is sooooooooooooooooooooooo long and pls make it able to dress up you're derp like other games like boo or pou... t-this is t-too long..."

I got disappointed seeing that all your other virtual apps are *exactly* the same. Same furniture, houses, mini-games, clothing, accessories, everything. Only one's a panda & the other's a cat. That's SUPER lazy, man. You need really hard work & creativity if u want 5🌟 to help pets. Well at least Shibo's nicer in this 2° version.",

      "Cute. Has some glitches. It's hard to click on stuff. Menues sometimes won't go away. I don't like that everything is crooked...Buildings, fences. The sheep go right through fences so what's the point? And the day/night cycle sucks. It's just a dimmer hard-to-see screen. Wish it just stayed bright.",
      "This game is the cutest but I have trouble selecting the trees and bushes and when I'm switching between the farm and town views, what I click on in the town will activate things in the farm. Also the feature of having to buy crystals with real money is somewhat annoying. It limits you if you don't want to or can't buy crystals. I think the watch ads to earn crystals should be permanent. So I can't give a full 5 stars right now. But I still play and love the game.",
      "I love this game! The sheep are so adorable and there aren't even any ads. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because of the screen overlays. When in a context menu, the game reads taps as though they were on the main screen (super annoying and sometimes wastes resources). But graphics are great, and the game is really relaxing to play",
      "It's a really nice game but I am having some difficulties with the screen. It's too big on my screen and the screen is shaking, it's shaking so much I'm afraid I might develop epilepsy. My phone is a realme 5 so maybe that's why it's freaking out, I do hope that the developers will fix this bug. For now I won't be able to play it.",
      "I think this game is great! The sheep and dogs are really cute too!nIt also has a few challenges that make the game fun! I don't have any current suggestions. I hope everyone else enjoys this game!"

      "Very cool awesome game BUT i would rlly like it to be more realistic when the bird are eating the animation is like stepping the food or water while eating or drinking also while there on the stick when u have (max) 30 birds on the cage its like u need more sticks because when they go to one stick all 30 of them cant fit only like 5 birds can be seen , very dissatisfied with the game, hope it will come as an update.I will put 5 if this updated will be putted.",
      "I use to like this game this game. I have been playing for five years. The up grades are great. You have a lot of glitchs that need to be addressed.Why dont you fix the free feather box? I havent been able to get feathers for a few months.Now it wont let me download the game. You ruined a great game. What gives? Please fix the glitch.",
      "Okay, this is an amazing, fun, adorable, and relaxing game. I definitely reccomend it. I love this game, but I didnt give it 5 stars because It has a small problem. The eggs make me frustrated sometimes: when I'm trying to fill the bird feeders I click really fast so I accidentally buy the speed up button for the eggs, and it spends my feathers. It especially makes me mad when I'm saving up for birds. I've lost at least 120 feathers from clicking on them.",
      "It's a very cute game and I love playing it all the time, but sometimes when I want to watch ads to get more feathers it doesn't work. It shows me the ads but doesn't give me the feathers and instead shuts down the game on me I would give it 5 stars, but I would like for that problem to be fixed please or a solution to this problem on why this is happening to me please and thank you.",
      "Bird Land Of Paradise is quite a good game. If you're a bird lover (like me) you'll love this game! In this game you do alot of breeding, which I like because there is always new colors to get, and breeding quests also give a new challanges to master your skills. However, like any other game, it has draw backs: 1: My greastest complaint is yes, there is things to do but not alot. Can you add more features? Like possiably a Hachery for the eggs would be nice."

      "Looks promising but has one awful mistake. The game isn't optimized for full-screen view in notched or notchedless devices, and the game forces itself to be in full-screen, causing it to lose some image at the corners of the screen. It's very uncomfortable for the view and isn't enjoyable.",
      "I adore the game but after a day or two, it takes alot of time to load before playing the game and I'm never able to play it. Now I'm scared my PIX is dying or suffering... lol but please try to fix it, I would appreciate it!",
      "I really loved this game. The concept, graphics, everything. But there is one thing that really needs improvement; the minigames. You definetely should add more minigames. Not to be mean, but the memory game is really bad. I think you should get rid of the skulls or show the cards first before starting the game. It's kind of unfair. But overall, it's really good. I hope the devs notice this.",
      "Hasn't been updated for Android devices properly. It caters more so to iPhone users. Also hasn't been updated since last year and no new approvembts. Untill they fix Android screen size issues then I'll reodownload. Otherwise everything is to zoomed and cut off on the edges. No good",
      "A fun game, for sure. Really just what I was looking for, but with one big complaint. It has been said before- The minigame is very frustrating and it is making what should be a enjoyable game very unsatisfing. As a less pressinf suggestion, i would like a wiget of some kinf for my homescreen of the little guys. They are super super cute. I wish I could give more stars, but I have to let people know the very frustrations that so many people have mentioned. It really should be changed."

      "Updating yet again! I'm back to loving the app, as so far it has not had any issues. Still would love to see more animals added (rat, turtle, fish, guinea pig, etc) instead of using \"Other\" for everything. And a birthday setting for alarms, again instead of having to use \"Other\". But the app is improving, and that's awesome!",
      "The app is amazing - so helpful for my fur family of 2 dogs and 2 cats. Especially for the senior cat who requires medication every other day, the notifications are great. And keeping track of the senior dog that tends to have tummy trouble a lot. So helpful to have information available to give the vet. But also, the 11 Pets Support Team is awesome. I recently had a problem with synchronizing my information on a new phone. Multiple attempts failed, even when things remained fine on my old phone. Anyway, the Support Team was very responsive and communicative. They quickly looked into the matter, and it's been resolved. An awesome app with fantastic support!",
      "This app is great! The only suggestion I have would be adding some option to record the tricks your pets know, like sit, down and stuff. My guys know lots of behaviours and it would be great to have them on the app, specially it it could generate random sequences of the selected tricks to practice them in a random order everytime so they don't predict what you're about to ask for",
      "It's very useful to track almost everything related to your pets: weight, medication, vet appointments, incidents, etc. The reminders are very useful. I totally recommend it. The only thing I'm currently missing is the possibility to link the supplies and the events (e.g. \"Fleas & ticks\" automatically linked to the pipette stock).",
      "It's pretty good but I really wish they had separate categories for Guinea pigs, Snakes, Lizards, etc. Just having other means I can't customize multiple animal's care setting at once for 'Other', so I have multiple guins and have to change the same things over and over just to get everyone on the same page"

Number 1, The hamsters rarely come out and, 2, getting gold seeds is next to impossible. I Still love this game, though!",
      "I loved this game. I wanna start off with the fact that this game is really fun and I really enjoyed playing it. I use the past tense because there was an issue that forced my phone to be completely wiped and I had to redownload all my apps.My first thought was to feed my hamsters.Note: I paid money for certain things in the game that were no longer available after I redownloaded everything. All my progress. Gone. 15 hamsters that I loved! Gone! I am livid! Furious! All the furniture, toys gone!",
      "Best game everrrrr!I have played this game for just a few months and i am in love wih it😍Every time u just need to close the apl for a while than open it then u will find hamsters eating or playing,u can use some seeds to buy some food and toys,u can also buy some cute hamsters,u can even touch them😆😆And every time the hamsters finish playing and eating ,they will leave u some awards...how cute 🐽Its a very relaxing game 😊100/100👑",

      "Well the game is only a bit good . But it is a ritual of coco games to lock maximum things. I have played many games of coco and in all the games maximum things are locked. It's very disappointing. I gave 3 stars only for graphics If the graphics were not good then I used to give 1 star only . My complaint is all about locked things. 😑😑😡😡😠",
      "The game is good, different actions/games. The only bad thing is having to pay for all the little extras and the CONSTANT ads. They come up after nearly EVERY little thing they do. It makes it hard for little kids (and parents who have to come and either exit the ad or put them back into the game when they touch something and it takes them to the app store)",
      "This game is so fun! I just love playing it. I know i installed today maybe i dont know how to play it. I got the pink one but im having so fun with her. My best place is the park when we play with the frisbee. Im very happy for my puppy! 😉 And i can't wait for the update 😊😄 Dont forget to make more games. I love them so much. If play store give you to make more games i would be so happy! I <3 you! 🤗☺",
      "This app is fun for people who love puppies and dogs, but I personally think that it isn't necessary for there to be so many things that you need to watch ads for! I guess I recommend this game, but trust me, there are alot of ad things. Oh and also, there is only one puppy that you have and all the others cost real money. There is also two places that cost money, and alot more. I just want to let everybody know that sees this, I don't like it very much. Also the ads.",
      "Great game. It's really fun for kids. And teens. Anyways. I love playing it while I fall to sleep every day. Oh and am watching spongebob squarepants. Not a bother anything for some game for children under 6÷12 politics and any person who wants to get a prize. 10 years for a prize I will be gone that day to sad😣 as i talk along my nite I don't really spell that good. Bye for now! Bye. Just my sister is BENDY I'm not kidding I'm Sirius!"

Try Petfinder if you want to find an animal to bring home, this app could learn from that one!!",

      "This game is cute, fun and relaxing! I really enjoy it and if you like collecting cute things without having to play (or pay!) relentless and annoying games (especially the ones that like to cheat)! Then this game is definitely for you! Unlike Neko Atsume (cats) this game gives you way more credits to save up and buy stuff (which is why I prefer this game more). Oh, and you're not bombarded with ads either which is ALWAYS a plus! I can't recommend this app more! Download it today! ^_^",
      "I love it it's so cute I love getting new animals I think it's a game you should get but I can't get credits and I don't have much money so I can't bye enything",
      "entertaining and fun. all the spoon pets are adorable. wish there were more things to do",
      "The little Spoon Pets are so cute my brain hurts!!! I have Neko Atsumi, which is still the best of its genre, but this one comes close. Interacting with the pets (kawaiiiiii!!!!) sets it ahead of Neko, but the infant's nursery pastels and awful music drag it back. The 'William Tell Overture' with awkward loop splice? Really??? Picking up the pets in a spoon is so damn CUTE, though! Ok, ok, minus one star for the music. It's really awful.",
      "I just started playing it yesterday and I'm in love! Everything is so adorable from the graphics to sound and music 💕 You can also watch ads and play two mini games for more spoons which is good. I like neko atsume better but this game is also fun and relaxing to play 😊 I hope I collect all the cute pets soon!"

I saw that it was being updated to fix bugs so I updated the app. I went to book an appointment for my other dog, but all my information is missing, it won't let me log in (2 days now), and just asks me to verify my email again. When I click to resend the verification it gives an error message. I've had nothing but trouble with this app since I got it.",

I eventually gave up and uninstalled app and then re-installed it. App now has me logged in but still wont let me buy anything - as soon as i hit \"add to cart\" , the app closes itself.

When I went back to play minigames it did not let me because it said my pet was tired When I went to check on it it was tired, hungry and dirty. So basically I did all for nothing. Anyway yeah for that reason I uninstalled. Cute game but needs work on progressing.",

After finally hearing back, I was advised by the developer to reinstall again, and would have no ads... Not only did this fail, it completely reset the app. I no longer have my son's old pets, AND I also still have ads. Just save yourself and pick a different app. This one is terrible and has limited support.",
      "I really like this app but it keeps resetting. The first time it reset, i had over 90 pets, all kinds of hats, wallpaper and tons of XP suckers. So I started over and it keeps resetting. I has reset probably around six times over the last few weeks. Not sure what the problem is or if can be fixed.",
      "Its alright but i do have one complaint. Why, in the bubble shooter mini game, can you not switch between 2 colours at a time? Most bubble shooters (even when its a mini game in a virtual pet game) normally have this feature and its kinda annoying that this one doesn't. Other than that its okay.",
      "Love the game, it's cute, entertaining, and generally relaxing. My only complaint would be that you have to watch a dozen or so videos just to earn 1 gem. I think that 2 or even 4 videos would be more reasonable for earning 1 gem.",

Also, you can't check out reminders from the notifications, you have to open the app and you have to do it from the menu, not clicking on the notification",

      "Just when we all need to stay at home as much as possible,once again,Good Boy studios have turned their backs on their devoted players. The most recent change in format makes no sence,except that you can spend all your coins and never win. Slow,boring,and if you are a winner,they dont want to send you your prize. I won a prize last month.It says it will ship in 15 days but its probably the last prize I will ever win now.I used to look forward to playing. Now its downright depressing.Sad.😢",
      "Taken from a 4 star rating to a 3 and now a 1 after their recent update. That update had some very good things that I liked but I've also encountered many more issues and no help. First off, all of the prizes I actually wanted all seem to be gone now so that's great. More importantly, whenever I went to add my dog for a contest, the app glitched, didn't work, and had to be shut down. I constantly sent feedback and emails with no help. Uninstalled and reinstalled only to be back to a level 1.",
      "I had written a positive review a little over a week ago. That's all changed. The app has been completely nerfed! Everything costs more coins and you win less than half the tickets that you did before. You can only redeem one prize per month now, but good luck getting enough tickets! To add insult to injury, you can only use your pictures 5 times and then they're useless! I can understand giving out too many rewards, just higher the ticket prices a little, don't completely ruin a great app!",
      "Updated review 3/19/20. The developers have absolutely RUINED this app. I spent many months accumulating nearly 50,000 tickets but won't be able to redeem all of them now since there are only 2500 and 5000 level prizes, you can only redeem ONE prize per month, AND your tickets EXPIRE in 180 days. This company is greed driven and could care less about the user. It's time for a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT against the developers. They have basically \"stolen\" prizes from users who had accumulated large numbers of tickets. In my opinion, this was a deliberate action based solely on greed. The new version simply won't allow you to accumulate enough tickets to win any kind of prize that has value. What a rip-off. AVOID THIS APP",
      "I'm so back and forth with this app... They fixed stuff and made it great. But then I worked really hard spending too much time on this app to get a prize in the 25,000 range. I finally got the tickets and I was about to get my prize until I realized that they got ride of any prize over 5,000! What a waste of time"

      "I give Happy Bear 5 stars becauseit can repeat what you say and there are awesome games you totally should download it don't listen to haters.For instance Mia Randall is lying it's not the most boring game in the world she is being dramatic and if you don't die on a game it won't try and kick you out I play this everyday it doesn't do that and why would I type all this to lie that's wasting my time. If there is a hater comment don't listen to it find out yourself because you aren't them.",

      "The characters are cute and the games are original but you've made them way too challenging and almost impossible to win. We as the players aren't given enough chances to store weapons and therefore the game becomes very discouraging. I thought these were suppose to be for fun. Most people won't pay for the weapons so instead they delete the game.",
      "Very cute 3 match game in which you are in charge of a vet clinic featuring an emotionless recently graduate vet named Jesse and a raccoon as the vet assistant. The art is beautiful. Only changes I would make: pieces should move quicker, be able to customize Jesse (rename, gender, hair color, etc), able to watch optional ads for money or lives. Also can't see to change the pictures on walls in 2nd room",
      "I hated it at first but now that it was fixed I love it it does take a long time to beat levels that are difficult an it's hard to move far in the game an I play a lot of match 3 games I'm on level 800 on my other game but this one I'm not even to 100 yet but overall i love the storyline an the design aspect of it is wonderful I'm an animal lover so this is such a cute game to me.",
      "Very interesting and good game until level 76 where I have used up all my powerups and coins and I as a player don't always have the funds to buy more and that level is way too challenging I am now rating two stars cause game still needs improvement on levels",
      "Make this a more friendly game and not make the levels so hard. It's a pet game and do you really want someone playing this and getting frustrated because it takes forever to clear a level they take it out on an animal. Food for thought. But I'm uninstalling it. Sounds to me you don't care."

      "Was very entertaining except, I couldn't name the chicken myself, it wouldn't let me, so I had to use the pre-generated names. Also, after you can your first chick, it wouldn't let me play past dressing up my second, would have been fun to can multiple chickens and make a collection. Entertaining for a one time thing though 🤣🤣🤣",
      "While this game wasn't as child friendly as meets the eye, the twist is halarious. My friend suggested this game to me, and when I played it I thought it was adorable until the bike lmao.",
      "This game is so much fun! I like the part where the chicken gets shredded because it's funny. I hope you guys make a can your pet game where you can pick your animal and kill it. I play this everyday and i love it.",
      "This game was recomend to me and bbn I thought it was a silly kid game but when I clicked the bike I died of laughter because I wasn't expecting it. This app can make someone go vegan real fast",
      "This game used to be popular back in I'd say 2015. It was funny seeing peoples reaction to the end but, after a while it gets boring. It's the same thing over and over again. Although, the idea is very creative, something I wouldn't thing of."

      "Very fun game to pass the time",
      "It was a good app, actually. But Panda's always asleep and sleepy. I have to give him a potion just to be able to play. I understand the logic that pandas are sleepy but, how can I actually play without buying potion? But still, it was good. I still recommend it, if you wouldn't mind buying potions all along. Anyway, please do stan SB19, thank you. :)))"

It said I'd get 6000 coins for downloading Shibo 2 but I only got 1000. Maybe it sounds petty but it greatly upset me. I'm probably going to keep it until i evolve all the slimes just because I'm curious.",
      "This game is actually really fun. And will give the feeling of that you have a pet! Please help animals which is the news. You should because people are killing animals and I do not think that is nice. So I give this game a 5 star because: It is giving you feelings,letting you play like you have a pet,And is inspiring!",

      "Very cute, however it's frustrating that I can't save any progress. I can't link to my Facebook account, because I'm not a test user (?). I changed phones, lost my pet and had to start over. Otherwise I really enjoy my little pet and also the mini games (the \"2048\" is ADDICTIVE!!!) Way more fun than the original Tamagochi! 😊",
      "Such an adorable game to play when you have your free time !!!! 😙😘🙌 tho it does take time to level up and limited food/games to play with plumpy ( new name ) but overall its really cute . keep up the good work!!!!",
      "The game is very cute.. i really enjoy it..but maybe you can add more things like accessories and items in the house and mini games.. it's already a good game..good job",
      "This game is so fun! I love how you get to level up and care for you pululu! However I do hope there are more game options coming. I find the games entertaining but eventually they got a little boring. Also, love the game, continue updating, it is amazing!",
      "Does not fit my screen. If I open the game its not centered. Im using Xiaomi Mi 9T. Even if I use the \"always on screen\" function. I cannot see my Pululu on screen when minimized. Hopefully the developers would fix this for HD devices."

      "It's a really good game, been playing it ever since my first smartphone (like 9 years ago), thing is, the graphics haven't improved at all. The dragons look low poly as heck and the movements are really rough, and when I enter observation mode my dragon just walks away from the map. I really wish that you can improve your quality, it's a good game, but with really bad quality in animating the dragon.",
      "This game is awesome! I love it because I was playing it as a child and now it bring me childhood memories back! After all, it needs a little update to the mini games. It would be nice to have a online battle or something new! After all I highly recommend to download this game!",
      "Nice little game reason why i got this is because my daughter had this on her built in tablet i think played it now i like it alot hope they can inprove the graphics but there probably not been a update in years i think but still a good game hope it stays up coz me and my daughter like playing this when we have time thanks.",
      "Good game. Just few issues with Arena - still happening, that if you receive 5diamonds bonus, it disappear without able to use it (very bad thing). And - i just finished Vawe 20, but didnt received my reward, dragon Scar is red crossed and cannot advance to round 21. So thats why just 3 stars. if this will be repaired, i will be happy to increase stars rating.",
      "not sure why it says the Dragon is generation 1, when I seems that you can't get to being a second generation Dragon. It would be cool if there was the possobitly of the Dragon leaving/dying when left and not looked after, I find the fact that I know it will be fine leaves me not bothering for months and then picking it back up again. That said I do enjoy the app when I come back to it."

Your game already has so many ads do you really need to make it take longer to play for more ads????",

      "It's a great way for pet lovers to connect but some features of the app are horrible. One cannot update dates/ night after booking. One may require extending at times. The selection criteria for booking a job is not properly synched. For cat sitting, the only option I could select for hosting the cat was to select the one where I was supposed to walk a dog n upload pictures of dog walking and pooping. Even distance calibration was incorrect as I never took the cat out. Some specs can be fixed",
      "Easy platform to work on, edits to your profile can be made instantly, and customer service responses are quick! Approval for new accounts can take 2-7 business days for background checks, but that gives me time to prepare my home for pet guests. Can't wait to start accepting reservations!",
      "I have a good phone so this app shouldn't be glitchy, yet it wont allow me to enter my information when I try to sign up to be a service provider. I'm very disappointed. I would have loved to interact with all the other animals. And the opening ad pops up multiple times and I cant close it. If you can fix this for me I'd gladly download this app again",
      "Would suggest to send the job completion notification to petbackers once the full number of nights are fulfilled or to allow pet parents to select check out dates instead of number of nights. Said notifications are causing misunderstandings about when the pet should be returned and just kills the overall experience. When in the app, notifications about my pet being walked kept popping up even though I keep closing it.",
      "Mostly good UX, one broken flow, problem loading. I'm signing up to be a pet sitter. The friends' testimonial UX flow is incomplete, yet they require three testimonials before accepting jobs. Something is wrong with their English text fields. When I publish my profile in English, some words turn out to be \"#&@+\" unreadable, and I was not even posting any inappropriate words (normal words like \"2019, September, money, TLV\") Uploading IDs flow tends to get stuck on \"loading\"."

      "I think most people reviewing this app like the idea, but haven't tried to use it. We travel often with our pets, and live in a disaster-prone area, thought this could be useful info. Every time I've tried to look something up, the app describes the symptoms and then says to call a vet. No meaningful guidance whatsoever. I think the Red Cross is more worried about their liability than giving good advice. Will be deleting and buying a vet tech emergency textbook.",
      "Great basic info. The how to, what to look for & action to take to help them before transit to vet is simple & clearly written. There are videos that show actual cats demonstrating symptoms to help you recognize what to look for. There is a wealth of info re general facts ie. Normal heart rates & normal temp & how to obtain that info including CPR, proper wound, burn etc care. Always emphasizing the importance of obtaining prof help from your vet after any event. A must for any pet lover.👍✌",
      "🐈 A great guide for cat and dog basic first aid! 🐕 While not a replacement for proper veterinary care, this app is very well done and easy to follow, full of useful info for dealing with a large variety of problems pet owners might face - with not just facts, but also videos to guide you in performing emergency first aid properly. It even has a place to put your vet's emergency contact number for quick reference, and quizzes so you can test yourself on what you've learned. Highly recommended!",
      "Must have app for all of us with pets . It is the most useful app I have and the best of its kind. I learned what's my cats vital signs should be ans how to perform CPR if need arises. Also this app is for both dogs and cat medical emergencies.",
      "Wow! Love this! I am a certified professional pet sitter... I have the Red Cross Basic First Aid books and CPR cd's for cats and dogs, but this is so handy to have basically the same thing on my phone now, plus the feature of adding pet info of your own."

      "This game is amazing and so creative! This is the kind of game I've been looking for for years! The pets are all very cute, the questing feature is very macabre, with monsters and creepy outcomes and disturbing sprites, its like scary undertale. The food system takes a while to reload, but it makes it so you can't just run through the game which annoys anyone, but IS needed. If this company ever came out with a paid for version with even more features, I would buy it in a heart beat!",
      "PetQuest fills the itch for a giga pet inventively and in a fun way. While it has a randomized dungeoncrawer, I enjoy checking in on my (cat? Fox?) throughout the day and feeding him. You can play with them, too, and unlock different resources to teach, feed, and play. There are cute wearos friendly minigames that impact your stats, too. Where I feel there is room for improvement: the app itself feels clunky. Sometimes it skips animations altogether. There is no way to recolor your layout.",

      "This app was great for about a week until an update in November 2019. After that the app wouldn't open. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app several times. I contacted vitus vet and it took over two months to fix the app. They emailed me once the app was fixed. I reinstall the app and it works great. It's the easiest way to submit claims to nationwide for my pets. Hopefully there are no future issues."

      "Its super cute! CatHotel was actualy my favorite game. I used to have that game in my old phone in 2016 but since my phone but since my phone kept breaking and disconecting, my phone was restarted over and over again. But i remembered this game and started to download it. Its very fun but nothing changed since in the past and now and the animations are the same as the cats behavior.",
      "I think catHotel is a great game because of all the stuff to do and it's so much fun there's 4 things you can do for every cat and then when they get tired you have to put them to bed and give the cat back so they can go back the next day you start off with one cat and you can get more along the way and it's all at once I love the game and I hope you to oops there is one thing I forgot you can get different areas in your game get new levels and money and get cat hotel now I am truth it is amazin",
      "Love the art style and animation! This is a really cute game and I'm not deleting it anytime soon. The games are really fun and cool and this is overall a super nice game :3 Now, for the flaws :( Wish there was more to do, can only take care of one cat at a time, and a tiny bit glitchy. But I still love this game a lot! 👌👌❤️❤️❤️🐱🐱🐱🐈🐈🐈🐯🐯🐯🐅🐅🐅🐆🐆🐆:3:3:3",
      "It's simple yet quite realistic in showing the cats behaviour.. I love it! Especially because it's unrelated to real time making it perfect for someone who doesn't have much time to play like me! If you love cats that's definitely your game!",
      "This game is amazing! I love all of the cute cats and taking care of them. Plus, getting to decorate everything majes it even better!"

      "Another gentle soothing app. No loud music or fast game play, just a peaceful experience. minimal ads too. Beautifully made. The music, or just the water noise is so calming. I care about my jellyfish too.",
      "Well, I could complain about the ads all day, but hey! They weren't video ads, so that's cool. But the main thing bugging me out is that all you can do is play, watch, feed, change the light, and the change the water. The graphics are amazing as hell though! The music too... which I can see how people have it relaxing. But that's it? I mean I am a big fan of jellyfish but the gameplay here is poor.",
      "Very relaxing. Like the \"view\" option so all the words leave the screen and you can listen to the Zen music and watch the jellies. Wish the axolotl (sp) had the same option",
      "Enjoyable. Needs a bit more interactivity and jelly grow faster maybe need more attention but watching is so peaceful!!!"

      "I waited two hours for this game to download, and when it finally did, it would not load the game. For me, it was a waste of time, effort, and storage space. This NEEDS to be fixed. I've seen multiple reviews stating similar experiences. It isn't fair that we waste our time downloading it for it to not load into the game. 😡",
      "I would be able to give a reveiw IF it WOULD LET me PAST the loading screen. Untill I CAN ACUALLY play the game, I give this game 0 STARS. PLEASE HELP ME. Edit: I'm looking at this 9 months later the game's creators don't even seem to care. I'm very upset. Fix this soon please because for almost a year this game has not let me in. Very disappointing. :(",
      "This game is awful I waited 4 hours for it to loud and it loaded again in the game for2 hours and it did not let me in . It's stupid . I hate it so so so so so much. Whoever made the gameshould fix it soon",
      "Cool game. The surgeries get a little repetitive though.. maybe add some different ones. Also, it never works with wifi.. only mobile data. I have a galaxy 9+. Lastly, the amounts of money you need for staffing is ridiculous. Some people don't want to spend actual money on games or simply can't afford to. But overall it's a pretty good game with an interesting story."

      "When I downloaded this game, I have to say it's more than what I expected. It's great! :) I suggest though that at the start of the game, let us players customize our pet first plus put a tutorial! More minigames to earn money and more shop items please. Also about the fishing, I've collected a number of fishes but at my fish collection, it only records the number. The portaits are not there. Please fix. Other than those, this is a really cute game!! I find it enjoyable to play. Thank you! ^^",
      "There are some bugs but they could be fixed if more effort is placed. I downloaded this game because it was similar to Pet Societ and I am not that disappointed. It would be nice if you guys had more activities, more minigames, more salon designs and somehow let people have more interaction. It would also be nice for more furniture and seeds. Also add more rooms. However, I know that this app is new, only released last year so, I know that you guys can still improve it. You guys have my support!",
      "I loved the nostalgia but I disliked that: 1) Can't customize my pet from the start. 2) Abnormal connection made me lose my coins after I customized my pet. The game didn't save my new look but the money was still decreased. 3) Items are losing. I tapped on the soap you guys sent me for being level 1. It disappeared. The gift box and coin bag was hard to open.",
      "Really disappointed with this game. At first I was so excited to play it as I was a big fan of Pet Society. Everything is WAY too expensive and it's far too difficult to earn money. From what I have seen in the past 30 minutes of playing, the only way to earn coins is to race at the stadium (boring & repetitive), spin the daily wheel and sell items you obtain from levelling up. I imagine you can also sell the fish, but I didn't bother getting to that. Nothing but a money-grab. Waste of time.",
      "This brings back memory when pet society used to be available to play on facebook before it shuts down. If its possible lets spice this up a little. I got some suggestions : simple daily missions (like bathing) so that players motivated to log in everyday. Adding more mini games (like fishing contest) or ranking list into the game. Weather change (like snow) that be nice. I saw some people wants small pets to be added in and i want it too! But if it cant thats fine. Thanks for the game :)"

I highly recommend this App for any pet owner, especially those who travel with their best friend! Looking forward to new features, services and partners!",
      "Love this app, easy to set up and navigate. Clever design allows you to keep track of appointments, medical records in one place. This is especially helpful when traveling with my dog. Really like the family connect function as well as user ratings for suppliers. Can't wait to see the next set of features. Great app and a must have for pet ownes.",
      "Pet Conect is an amazingly convenient tool whenever I need to go out of town. The fact you can find nearby places that can watch your pet is already fantastic, but the ability to see ratings from other users and pet lovers push it over the top for me. Being able to ensure I am putting my cat Iris in a safe and friendly environment is everything to me, and this app has made it so much easier. I can easily request appointments for any housing or grooming that she may need. Plus, being able to store my many pictures of her on this app has cleared up so much space on my phone. 5 out of 5 stars all the way!",
      "I've been looking for a solution to house information for my pets. This app is perfect! Plus I love that I can explore and connect with local businesses. My favorite functionality is that I can share my pets info with my family and any pet sitters.",
      "Awesome app for us. We just moved and were able to quickly find a few new vets to interview, some grroming ships, the nest choices for boarding, and where to buy their special food, and of course toys! To find all the answers in one place saved us so much time. Thanks!"

In the forest there is a bunny you can adopt but you either need 800 hearts to adopt which is ALOT or you need a toy but you cant unlock the toy until level 7 which is a long way. Please make it abit easier to get your third pet/the bunny rabbit. Thank you",
      "I like the game. it's so hard to get hart's to get more pets. I've been saving up my money in the game but then is said a need a amount of hart's that is like, 300 ,250 450 ,350,500 and 550. WOW. Just WOW.",
      "I say that you should have more outdoor things more mini games and no buying things and you could you know more pads in the pets don't have to be pay with diamonds and it'll be like on the windows and I need that stuffing in a simulator and you can just explore and go and find coins over there and then get into people's houses and all that stuff and yeah",
      "I love how the animals are so cute and you could collect themit's like the best thing and I think you should install it because it is a good like a really really good game",
      "i woud give it a five if there was a easy way to get hearts so you could sdopt more pets, other than that the game is awsome!"
