      "Hi! I would put 10 stars if I had a choice. There is like, no ads! There's barely any lagging or bugs in the worst internet connection. You can add as many people as you'd like! And make them chat whatever you want. You can click make video when you're done with your masterpiece story and it becomes a little faster and records a video of the chat while it was being typed, somehow. You can buy passes to like get rid of the watermark, send pictures and a lot of other cool stuff! Recommended <3 it!",
      "I really love this app!!! It's easy to use but just one tiny thing, how do you save it, do you have to make a video for it? I tried but it stopped at 98% for a very very long time so I stopped it and cleared my story😨, And how do you preview it? It did it by itself one time and I didn't know how to do it, and can the colors be free, and the background please. Thank everything else I LOVE IT!😆 Please reply back when you get the chance 🙃",
      "Now, it's an awesome app, but it's fishy. I keep hearing thing, and when I put my ear up to the sound I hear weird breathing, even when I'm out of the app. But don't accuse me for blaming this app because, it started when I downloaded this. I'm not sure if this app is okay, but it just gives me a feeling of being watched.",
      "Thank you for adding this on android. This is one of the best games ever and I assure you if you download this, you will not regret it! The only thing is that some things cost money, I think that the things shouldnt cost money but i will let the creators decide if they wanna keep this feature or make them free. But really, if you download this, you will enjoy it, especially if you you are a gacha tuber and wanna make the gacha characters text. This will be the perfect app! Download this please!",
      "Making stories with the fake texts is a lot of fun! However, the texting sounds don't line up in the videos, and it would be nice if the videos were screen-sized instead of those little squares. It also crashes after I've cleared the story a couple of times, so I have to close and reopen the app. App still needs a little work, but it's definitely on its way there."

      "Yep, good for offline use! Impressive as well since the interface looks like a real messenger that can prank anyone out. The only problem here is the \"timestamps\" that pops up every little time you receive/send a chat, kindly fix it or atleast include a button for users to edit that out. Creating an app like this is a job well done anyway! ;)",
      "This is soooo much fun! There r very little adds and it is so real. Incase u r wondering, the app does not meesage back when u message the person in ur contacts. When u press send, I can pick to receive that message or to send that message. This app is amazing. If u r a kid like me, and ur parents won't let u get messenger, this is perfect!!!!!",
      "a moderately okay to good app for making aus. One of the apps that have good layout design so far. Its just that it needs wifi to work and sometimes it has slow response on an action like tapping a button. And is there an option tho for changing or removing the timestamps?? I hope there is so that i could change it :((",
      "It's the best of all of these I've tried, I like the different preset styles and the group texts. It looks good and works well so 5 stars. Here is my feedback though after using it: -the dates and time stamps aren't customizable or removable, which is really a problem for my story. I'll need to spend a ton of time editing those in another program. If you can't customize them, at least let me turn them off. -Sometimes it crashes -the process for making group texts is weird",
      "It works really well there are just a few things that could be improved. First off sometimes when you try to select a picture it just doesn't change. Also it would be really cool if you could turn the time off in the settings so you can't see when the messages were sent. If these 2 things were fixed/added I'd rate it 5 stars."

You can edit your icon and color for free and its just an amazing app. I highly recomend you get this app! I think what would make this app even more better is if you could pick any color in the rainbow for your profile picture. (Sorry if I don't make sense)",
      "Hi! I love this app VERY VERY much and I loved letting my imagination run wild and make my own stories for myself, this is a very good roleplaying app and I would recommend, but could you add a history? Because I delete things on accident or things that I've typed and I would like to go back and look at it",
      "This is amazing. I love the way you can make anything your profile picture. But what would be cool is if there was a two parts there could be like one person talking and then the other( like two conversations going on).",
      "I would rate a full 5 stars everything else is so awesome no more problems for me except one tiny fix that would make this app so enjoyable make it possible to actually be able to text in our created text stories so we can watch ourselves be in our own text chat stories if you get what i mean but if you do this please make it possible to do this offline",
      "It is absolutely amazing if your doing something like a movie and you need a texting scene and a lot of it is free unlike texting story. :p and it looks exactly like some actual talking apps!"

EDITED: I'm updating my review because I've had it for a long time and I have to say, the ads don't even bother me anymore. Definitely worth it! I love everything about the app. I'm gonna buy premium as soon as I can. 😆",
      "I like being able to create my own custom conversation with someone who may not even exist. It makes me feel like I have someone to talk to without actually talking to anyone. What I dislike are these pop-ups that say \"you have 1 new app to download\" every time I try to edit a conversation or change my profile picture. And then those pop-ups automatically open the internet in the middle of me trying to do something. Get rid of those and I'll rate this app 5 stars",
      "It was a good app. You can edit what you want in your opinions. But there's something i want to ask... Why it can't send picture? Any of picture. Even one. When i try to send, It just went to blank. Please fix this soon♥!",
      "I'm using this app to write a bnha fanfiction called Chatsick. The ads are intrusive but it's a small price to pay for the options available to customize the appearance of the app. I have a few requests! For one, it'd be awesome if I could download a transcript of the conversations I create which includes usernames and has the option to include timestamps. I'd also love to add characters changing the name of the group chat. I'd love to see an app where I could emulate a discord server!",
      "App does not respond it has adds every five seconds and even if it did work(but it doesn't) it would still be terrible because you wouldn't be able to experience it P.S The author is disrespectful and rude by saying someone was dumb and blind a while ago Oh and forgot to mention the author sucks again forgot to mention that the top reviews are bots"

      "The app is very neat and organized. But i encountered 3 problems while using it: 1. I can set the time in the notifications bar, but the time in the chat below the word 'iMessage' still follows the time of my phone 2. I only made one chat. I scrolled it all the way down in my inbox to see what would happen. It went missing and i have to recreate the chat 3. Sometimes the text message boxes are blurred at their round corner (especially the blue one)",
      "i really enjoy using this app, but recently there is one slight problem. the group chat feature has some errors. for example, person 1 would send a gray message, then person 2 would send the second gray message. when i hit the send for person 2, person 1's contact picture and name goes missing making it appear that person 2 sent the message. please fix this",
      "AMAZZINGGGG APP!! It works really good just like imessage, it also turns emojis into iphone style which is the best feature. Although there are some little bugs which i wish could he fixed like how the app lags when u go to edit contact profile and try to go back. It also lags while scrolling if the too many chats messages are there. Please add an option to UNDO the reactions on chat bubbles. Also i wish i didnt have to pick a contact from my actual contact list to make a new fake contact IN APP",
      "It's a really good app, but I am going to need you to work on your set up a bit more. Like, you are basically forcing people to download the premium version :/ it was really good when i first downloaded it but you guys are getting a bit bold with these updates... please work on the video making and the saving of things, dont just force people to get premium cause that will make people dislike the app more :)",
      "it's good, but it doesn't work pretty well. i mean, you should have the option of creating a new chat without having to choose one of your contacts, and the message editing doesn't work properly neither, once you create a convo it's so difficult to edit it because it wouldn't let you change who sent the message and sometimes it changes the person without u wanting to."

      "I would like to give this 5 stars, and I would have a couple of years ago. I cannot now because of how ridiculously expensive this game is. You guys keep increasing the bits cost while also lowering store payouts. The game moves soooo slowly because I can't do anything without a large amount of currency. Challeneges are also impossible without paying actual $. Its unfair and seems greedy...the mane 6 would be disappointed. :(",
      "It's pretty fun, I like watching everyone wander around, and decorating the towns is fun, but... man, the microtransactions are pretty bad, technically you can get everything you want without throwing money at the game but they reallty want you to. Gems for example, you don't get them very often but a lot of things cost hundreds of gems >_< March 7th, 2020. The game runs terribly, like a crippled old desktop trying to boot up crysis. I have to drag the screen for ages to look around...",
      "I love this game, but no-one has infinite amounts of money to spend in-game. This makes ALL events & stories stressful. A nice thing would be a balloon pop where you can get characters, helpers & other prizes from previous events & stories, so that people playing the game don't want to smash their phone or UNINSTALL the app every time they don't manage to complete or get anything from the events and stories. Please? It'd help. Also, I never received Cosy Glow. I did earn her from leveling up...",
      "Some lag, lots of microtransactions, and the occasional, relatively minor, glitch. Other than that, my only complaint is that there is currently no way to complete the \"What's Hot\"/event sets after the time is up. I would honestly be willing to put more money into this app if I could still purchase the characters from the Reflections event, or the recent \"She's ALL Yak\" event (especially Future Yona and Smolder, as those are the only two I still need to complete that set)",
      "There are multiple glitches that end up wasting my time and money. And as we all know, this game needs lots and lots of money for you to stay hooked. I grinded hard for a social event and have not gotten my reward. AND I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN A REWARD. And I'll be unstoppable in a game, but when that happens, there's just coincidental lag that ends up ending my run or my streak! I'm HIGHLY unhappy about the time and effort you have to put into things just for it to glitch out. And the events are nuts"

      "It is a very good app and works very well i can even upload my storys to Youtube. However the prices to add photos and to take away the watermark are slightly over priced. Over all its really good its just a bit expensive. Thank you for such a great app over all though. You dont get apps this good very often.",
      "After buying the app you could at least upgrade the interface And here are some features we would like to see. 1. Changing of text when imputing as if you were going to say something else 2. Switching between chats 3. Delay controls on typing bubble Otherwise good job",
      "This app is really fun and you can do a lot with this app ! But when I scroll down my text video it's slow and lags when I scroll down and it also doesn't respond a lot compared to my other apps I have installed on my phone. Good creative app overall!",
      "I like it but one thing ads are too much otherwise this app is great but you have to pay for something and some child that use their parents mobile if they pay for that it would be bad for them and also I am a child using my parents mobile.",
      "Guys. If any of you own a Samsung galaxy tablet, DO NOT GET THIS!. It says record with sound? when I try to export my story, and it doesn't give me any option in how to do that. I HATE THIS DAMN THING. it's a waste of storage."

      "App sucks now. Used to allow to make fake texts in your standard messaging app now it only uses the app itself to make fake texts. For example you used to be able to select contact, compose text, set time, then have it as an outgoing or incoming text in your actual messaging app. No more. So you don't have any history of actual texts to make it more realistic. Trash now",
      "This app used to be the best fake message app on the play store. If you want the old app, search online for \"fake text message old version\" and download version 5.3 from \"uptodown\" webpage. It's the last version before they switched to version 6 because of play store rules. Its not the applications fault because of rules they had to follow..they still had the best app out. Give em 5 stars guys.",
      "There's an ad after every text message they really need to fix that up because know one is going to like it if its ad after ad its very annoying when i am trying to type something and i am done and i send it its just straight away ad overall its good but you need to fix that problem i know i sound like i am whining but its your choice its a very good app just please fix that problem thank you😃",
      "The updated version is full of confusing..The previous version was too easy to operate as compare to new version its very difficult to operate..Better was the old version",
      "Terrible! I can't stand when people change something that's already good and make it bad. The original version was perfect. You could choose the date you sent a message, choose the time, and it would actually go through and look like a real text on your phone. Change it back to the original version!!!!! Seriously!!!! 😡"

I have downloaded the app again and it's working, except for the paid options are no longer available. Obviously I don't want to pay again so hopefully you can sort this please?",
      "The game is much pay to win. After 3 levels, you have to buy the other ponies to complete the other levels. If you don't, you're stuck. You can't progress any further until you make a purchase for the ponies. Stupid. Completely stupid.",
      "I'm not even a MLP fan but I must admit when I saw this I was curious and I guess the characters have grown on me somewhat from seeing them online all the time. The game is pretty good but it lacks challenge so perhaps if more obstacles were added to increase the difficulty the game would be even better. Also the option to replay stages should be there too so if possible please add that. Overall not bad but definitely needs improving.",
      "I love this game but I have to give it 4 stars because other ponies were locked I hope Budge Studios gets a update for unlocking Rarity, Rainbow dash, and Pinkie Pie but I still love this game don't even want to uninstall it I can not stop playing",

      "Really like it and appreciate the work the developers put into the app. You do have many features and the design makes it easy to make quick, effective and convincing changes which do mostly look like the real surface of Whatsapp. There are still some features I'm missing but it is already possible to create a very convincing and real looking fake chat and even a fake status. Great work!",
      "This is a really really good app I ever seen. However, I wish the call can improve more like to more real. The reason is the time of call is always 'Today' but the time was correct. I don't know whether I set is wrong or the thing is already fixed. Nevertheless, this is a good app. Thank you. 👍👍😻😻",

      "This review is from someone whose never left a review on an app, ever! There are definitely bugs in this app to be worked out, however it was WORTH it! Even paying the credits. I used it and tested it first, it was kinda spotty but the voice change was fantastic! I bought 60 credits it's 1 credit per minute. Buy it to get \"Access to EVERYTHING.\" Skeptics should do the smallest package. It worked fine for me, if there's problems just restart your phone and call out again. Loved it!",
      "The code to sign up took a bit to be sent but once it did arrive and I got things set up the app worked great. The call went through fast and the quality was good. You get limited free uses but I don't really see myself needed to make that many calls that need a false caller ID. So for how well it worked and that its free (somewhat) i would recommend it. The only real downside as others have stated it would have been nice to be able to choose what number it would use going out.",
      "Ok, first off I understand people are mad because it chooses your number for you, but that is googles fault not the app developers. I for one enjoy the app, it has a good voice changer feature that is fun to mess with it and can actually come in hand. It works like it says it will and yeah I agree that is needs to many permissions but there isn't anything on my phone I'm trying to hide anyway so whatever that's not a problem for me. I thoroughly enjoyed using the app and will probably pay for more credits and continue to use it.",
      "There is a ton of potential with this app and I can tell the team behind it has passion for the project. I like the ability to call from a contact, but was not able to see how to call from an anonymous number. Still, I think the app does what it says it will do and doesn't try to hide anything. I'm going to give it five stars based on the potential it has and the fact that it does what it advertises.",
      "This app is a nice app. I really like how it gives you the option of changing your voice that is a really cool feature. I think that it might be a little buggy but once the kinks are worked out this will be a  great app. My call went through without a problem. I was able to change my caller ID and I could clearly hear what was going on on the other end. This app get five stars from me because it in my opinion is the best fake caller app on the Play store."

It's so funny you should definitely download it I highly recommend it. it last forever ❤️",

One, when your halfway through a story, it says you have to wait for 5 minutes untill you can read the rest. 2, whenever it shows a photo in the storys and you click on it to see the photo it says you need to buy PREMIUM. SOOOO DUMB. 3, theres only 2 genres. Horror or romance. Worst story app ever.",
      "I paid for a year's subscription and I am not happy. I hadn't used the app for quite sometime. What happened to it? Where is the list to choose what kind of story I'd like? Why does the audio and video only work on rare occasions in the same story? What's up with the lag between episodes? Why can't I stop something and continue where I left off? Why can't I stop a video, audio, chat and choose something else? When I first installed the app it was fine but not anymore. Why did you ruin it?",
      "It's quite a good app because if I'm bored I just open up this app and start reading or of I'm in the mood for a good scary book read. It aslo helps me with vocabs and my understanding of the story line and emotions",
      "This is bad it makes you pay money to go to the next part of the story but if you don't pay you still have to wait 5 whole minutes just to play you can't even look a the pictures without having to pay this sucks just to steal your money",
      "I love rhe book it starts you with wich is life of the party and everyrhing is totaly worth the wait but one thing if your waiting five mins but you come back in an hour it should let you read more and it deosent even let you read how many mins tou have waited i waited for five mins and it only let me read for three mins it should defenetly get that updated over all that thos app is great!😋"

      "Daughter was having fun, then she gets to a quest that requires 4 ponies. I was happy to pay the $4.99 to unlock them all. The purchasing system wouldn't work. I downloaded the app onto my phone (was on her tablet before), I still can't purchase it. We have had several issues with Budge games and this is just one more to add to the list of games that require a purchase and then doesn't work.",
      "Very deceptive. While it does say that it offers in-game purchases, it neglects to inform you that at one point in the game, you are fundamentally unable to continue playing, even prior stages, without purchasing in-game items. My children were very disappointed to find this out, as I was. There are better ways to free-to-play, other than outright disabling the game once you reach a certain point: we used to call that kind of nonsense “demos”, and you KNEW that you were playing the game to review it's suitability for purchase. There is nothing in this game's description that suggests otherwise. Basically, this game was nothing more but a demo masquerading as a F2P game.",
      "I bought all the ponies at one fine cuz it just made more since. At some point in time you do have to buy all of them to continue to play. My daughter loves this game. Sometimes I play to help her when she's busy. She's 5 😊👍",
      "I love this game so much but the only thing that I hate is that I can't buy anything we only get three ponies and 2 thrones and if we click the lock ponies you have to buy it but I still love this game!",
      "ADS! You literally can not do ANYTHING without watching ads. Want to play the game? Spend coins, diamonds, or watch an ad. Don't have coins or diamonds because you can't earn them without spending them? Too bad! Terrible. For a franchise that makes so much you'd think they could do better.."

      "It would be good, but there are a lot of issues. For one, I think the pop-up ads show up way too much, and whenever I add or remove the status or configuration bar it resets the profile picture, and it got pretty annoying having to reset it every time. I also wish I had the ability to put replies on the Twitter posts, and I'd also like to be able to make fake YouTube videos.",
      "Unusable. Tried it out for maybe 10 minutes but the constant ads made it near impossible to actually do anything. If they were less infrequent it'd be okay.",
      "The app was really cool and efficient although I couldn't seem to add replies to the tweet when I'm creating a fake tweet.",
      "This app is good! It's easy to use, it has nice tutorials and it delivers what it promises, but it could be so much better! Here are my suggestions to improve what Yazzy already offers: just as on Facebook template, we should be able to add comments/replies on Twitter and Instagram ones; the Instagram template needs an update because that's not how the actual app looks like anymore; the IOS messager template could be updated to IOS recent style — also, users often ask for the possibility to add a profile picture, emojis on the \"contact\" name and an option to choose between green and blue messages from the sender (we only have green) and these suggestions should be taken into consideration. People just want a funnier experience and more customizable templates! Still, I think there are more changes that could make this the best app for creating fake social media templates on Play Store. Here are my suggestions: the most important is that we should be able to save users/contacts, so we won't need to make everything from zero every single time we use Yazzy; the second one is that more social media templates should be added! Groupchats templates (which are often requested by users!); timelines and profiles templates for already existing options (mostly wanted for Instagram and Twitter!); new options as: Snapchat snaps and chat, Skype chat and video calls, YouTube videos and channel, Tumblr posts and profiles, etc. People who own Android devices and create social media stories (yes, that's a thing!) don't have many options. Although there are tons of apps at Play Store, it's difficult to find good apps to make fake social media templates. If there's a good app that offers lots of customizable options, people will definitely download it because it will be the only one offering so much at once! On IOS there's the famous app Social Dummy, which seems to be great, and is known for having many templates and customization options. For Android users there's no similar app though, and the most complete one is Yazzy, which is good, although it needs improvements a lot. Would be amazing if the developer(s) could work more on this app to create the first one having so many options available for Android! We won't need to download lots of other apps to create fake texts, profiles and posts if Yazzy offers more options. (And, honestly speaking, I would be glad to get rid of so many apps I have downloaded and replace them with an \"all-in-one\" app!) I really hope these suggestions can be considered! I wish all the best to developer(s)! ✨ A big thank you for investing your time in Yazzy and creating a good app that helps people to express their creativity 😉 don't abandon it though! Keep improving it and releasing new and better stuff when it's possible.",
      "Have had the app for ages to use for fun memes and visuals for writing and roleplays. However, in the years I've used the app, not ONCE has the 'remove ads' button been functional. I haven't a single clue why it refuses to work, but the ads are an absolute NIGHTMARE and I'd happily pay the upgrade IF IT WOULD LET ME! I may have previously left the same review on the other app by this developer as well to no avail. 😭"

      "This app has been such a blessing for me. It allows me to stay in touch with my family and friends by texting and calling free using WiFi and this incredible free app. Due to job loss from company shutdown no longer able to afford cell phone plans for family causing great hardships but the devs of this app, guardian angel and lifeless useless phones with no service plans on hand and cheap wifi for low-income families my family and I can start to get back on feet again plus shed stress also.",
      "The calls always drop and the app constantly crashes. In order to reach someone I have to try and call back now up to 3 times in a row! I can't even send emojis to people because they appear as a scramble of random script to them. Not being able to just pick up when someone calls is SO inconvenient. Also it sounds like the conversations are being tapped. You can hear rattling or your own voice echo back through your speaker. The loud ads at the end of calls are annoying. Zero stars if I could.",
      "Zero stars.I used this app for for everyday calling and texting for almost 2 years until the other day when it automatically logged me out and then said my phone# has expired. I lost all of my text history and all of the #s I had conversations with that weren't saved in my contacts because I never thought I would randomly just lose access to my own conversations over night. I have customers that owe me money that have no way of collecting from now and they can't contact me now either. Not happy",
      "Brilliant app! Quick to sign up and set up everything how I want it etc! Far cheaper than buying credit, I've had a reliable service so far on calls and texts. Would recommend this app to everyone that loves keeping in touch with people and who want to do it for as cheaply as possible, or even for free if you don't mind watching a few videos and adverts."

The sound effects are great to the actual iPhone sounds, I think it would make it a whole lot better if you keep the sound effects but don't record the background sound. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars. Thanks and I hope this issue can be sorted. 😁😁",
      "Although this app has some adds that could be 'disruptive', it is a wondeful app. It is very fun but it takes a lot of time to make a video/story but in the end it is worth it. Sure, you do have to get used to the app at first but if you are 13+ this app would be amazing for you.",
      "Terrible. Its pretty useless, It wont let me save a video. I go to record it and it exits out. Im not the only one to have this experience so I guess it might not work for Android. You can try your luck but dont put too much effort in beauce it will most likely be lost. Game makers if you fix this bug your game will be great."

Not back to the original \"contacts\" that you started with, but all of my fake text messages. I thought it was just a glitch in my phone, so I deleted redownloaded the app, but the same thing happened once again. Please fix this. It had me very aggravated. Its a waste of time to type & get reset. I will happily rate a 5 star if this bug gets fixed but as of now, this app is not recommended.",

      "It's a ok app to have if you don't have a phone with mins on it , and it's ok a third of the time with connection you can get on it only if you've got WiFi or with service on your phone it saves you from having to have your real number given out. So I give it 3 stars needs some improvement though. But , whoever thought this up actually came up with a goid idea.",
      "This app is very usefull and its great that you can earn minutes! Hear lately since I had to install on a different phone because I broke my old one, it has been giving me a little trouble loading messages to respond and also making calls. I have faith that the company will work with me on fixing whatever the issue is! Thank you for creating a way to keep in touch and make important phone calls I would recommend this app to others!",
      "I have my own phone number, and as long as I make at least 1 call per month, I get to keep my minutes that I have acquired. It is that simple. You watch ads to add minutes or you do other things that get you extra minutes. If you can take an hour a day building up minutes this is for you. The one thing is you do have to be connected to a wifi spot to use it. And you can find those anywhere they have wifi.",
      "Text free is worth your time and even more. The people who created the app care about you being able to contact who you need to contact . In happy times are in sad times. And for all times. You can also make request to them. And they may be able to Grant your request the app creators. They are happy to help you and assist. Like, share, comment, thank you all God bless.AMEN",
      "App doesn't handle two factor authentication for most apps... rendering this useless. Best part, riddled with ads, got to watch videos every minute to keep it functional. Interestingly, they ask you how the app is, and if you click 1 Star within the app, it only gives you an option to \"Submit feedback to developer\" or \"Cancel\" -- so essentially unless you give them a five star rating, they won't bring you here. Uninstalled after trying to get 2FA working for 15 minutes."

You have to have a membership that is $69.99 per year. How dumb do you have to be to pay that much for fake texts when there is something on snapchat that does the same thing for free. Would rate it zero stars if I could.",
      "It only let's you read one episode and then you have to pay for the rest. This app is a waste of time, I think the story's could be good but not worth the money. I hope they can fix this otherwise no one will download this app. Do not download this app, in my opinion it's really not worth it.",
      "The reason why i gave two stars is because the app was really fun while the free trial was going on but as soon as i cancled because im not paying 70$ for a stupid game it didnt work at all not worth the trouble of installing and uninstalling why have a 'free' app if its not really free",
      "I HATE IT no wonder this app has bad ratings you cant even finish the whole season it's so BAD I absolutely hate it.. sooo let me get this straight you clearly want money and dont care about us!?!?!?! 1 STAR and if there was a rating that you had the choice to pick no stars THAT WOULD BE YOU STUPID \"YARN\" I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT",

      "Amazing coaster creator, physics are realistic and unlike nolimits2, coasters are very easy to create. There are a few downsides tho. Most notably, whenever you leave the game, all your progress is lost. Now there is a autosave file. But, it's SUPER annoying when the game decides to crash. This game has Soo much potential! I've fallen in love with creating realistic coasters in this game. Overall, great coaster creator, just has some annoying bugs and crashes here and there.",
      "100% the most realistic coaster game on the store. The other games just lack logic. Some just go slow at some points. In this game, if you run out of speed, you start to go back, and it adds a lot more strategy. The camera is a teeny problem at the start, but it's easy to get used to. Any Coaster Enthusiast needs this app. My only problems are minor. The lack of free track types and lack of preset elements are a tad bit annoying, but all in all, this is easy to pick up, and a great time waster.",
      "I LOVE this game. I've built, like 20 coasters in this. I don't care for the Tycoon series and just want to creatively build coasters, and this does the trick! I wish there was wooden coasters, more inversions to build, and that the other coaster types weren't locked behind a paywall, but otherwise near perfect!",
      "By far the BEST rollercoaster building mechanics I've ever seen in a mobile game. The only thing that would make it better if it were more of a tycoon game. The scenery is a little bit bland. I would install Rollercoaster Tycoon, but like I said, this game has WAY better constructing mechanics. Very excellent job! 👏👏👏",
      "This is a very nice simulator! The only reason i leave 4 stars is because i cannot change the material of the tracks and supports. It is also possible to build higher than zoom allows, so you should probably limit build height to 2400 ft. Maybe add some more shapes of tracks instead of straight, left loop and right loop. Possibly add a community builds tab and multiple train support."

      "Ok, I Love this Game & I Just finished Chapter 3 on both of the apps! \"Nora's Mystery\" as well! I also like how you have to wait for the next day to continue another chapter. You don't have to wait exsacty 24 hours. I really hope you make another one of these apps soon 'cause I'm in Love w/ Both! (Also adds are not that bad. They pop up like 3 times during a chapter & you can choose to to get coins)",
      "I love this game so much i'd wait hours to play this game. The only con is that you have to get 450 coins to play again. It would be easier if it was atleast 250, but i can get passed that because of how instresting the stories get.",
      "I loved this game. Perfect app to pass the time during our COVID Quarantine. It's very interactive. I left like I knew the characters and the responses are definitely linked with my mind. Great game.",
      "i love this game because it is like the missing nora one and i love it so much i hope there is another one coming out soon i love it and ya i play it 24/7 it is so creative and it seems so real aswell. like the pictures of their profile and the time and other things it just looks so real and i love it and i hope u do toooo.",
      "Its very fun but you have to wait till the next day to continue or else you have to spend coins that you have to buy. Other than that, great game!"

      "This app is just unique. I have it for years yet I didn't get bored ! The original (main) story is just wow, it's simply the best thing in the app. I tried to find other stories (created by users) that is great like the original but simply there isn't (except for one or two stories - \"Under the moonlight\" is the best story so far) I hope that the creators themselves create another story.",
      "This game is actully well-constructed in story. I cared about the characters and the descisions that I was making. Its emotional, its great, its worth playing. There are also other options on this. You could also try some stories created by other people. Well done.",
      "I played this game a long time ago and now that 2019 is almost over, I'm playing it again. I don't know why this app is very significant for me. I just fell in love with the characters and specifically to this app. I wish there are many other application like this. Free and just wonderful. This is a great app to learn something and to experience how is it like to be in a romantic movie. I can't say anything more, I just love this app.",
      "Sorry for being rude, but Nicole has freak me out. Boring story, dialogs are unnatural , characters a dumb (well, they're teens), gameplay is weird. Typing words is exhausting, and it's weird when heros go outside and... Talking through mesagges, really? And there's kinda illusion of making choices. The charachter loves his friend no matter what and you can do nothing about it but follow the plot",
      "Annoying. The only \"story\" they let you start with you have to play as a \"male\" and \"date/fall in love\" with a \"female\". I'm a female. I am not going to \"date/fall in love with\" a \"female\". Also, make it available to change the person's name who they are chatting with, it ruins any chance of getting attached to the person you're \"chatting\" with... very disappointed"

      "Dear Hasbro.... i really like the game but there is some things that are very frustrating... 1. When you go to scan the pony it doesn't work properly. I have been trying for ages and ages but it has never worked..... it would be awesome if you fixed it so it will work. 2. Whenever I open mail it crashes the game so i keep on reopening the game and its never stoped doing that... if you have the time to fix the app i would really appreciate it. Thank you hasbro.",
      "This game has glitched badly and even though I purchased extras in the game it will not even open now. Just a black screen. Absolutely terrible and a total waste of money!!!!!",
      "it wasn't that bad…only a bit of gliching has happened to the game for some reason still good…keep up the good work creator!",
      "Scanning feature needs work...  This game lets your child scan their My Little Pony toys that have the Cutie Mark Magic hearts on them, which is cool, but the scanning feature is very temperamental. Sometimes it works in about 1-2 seconds - other times though, I find myself spending 15-20 minutes trying to coax the app into scanning my child's toy so that she can continue playing the game. I have tried following all of the instructions and tips provided by the developer and have made sure to scan the toy the exact same way and under the exact same conditions shown in the app's tutorial (and I have done this many times). This is no help. Sometimes it works well, but sometimes it makes you want to pull your hair out.   Don't get me wrong, I think that it's a great game and my 5 year old daughter has enjoyed playing it for almost two years now. I just really wish that the scanning feature could be improved. If it worked reliably all the time, or at least 90% of the time, then I would give a 5 star rating.",
      "I love it! And if people say that the you NEED to scan to,YOU DON'T DUMMIES! THERE'S A RANDOMIZER IN THE GAME,OH MY GOD!Anyways the game is awesome my sister loves it."

      "It is the best app! If u are a scaredy cat, but still want to read scary stories, this is the app! The ads are 5 seconds each, so it is very reasonable, the stories don't have to be paid for! I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to fill up their time. And i would also recommend this to bookworms.😁",
      "I love this app. You don't have to pay for anything and for the first FEW pictures there is a very, very, VERY short ad. Then there is none. Alot of the stories are scary which I LOVE because I love scary stories. I suggest you download this app if you want to read scary text messages without having to pay to read the whole thing. You don't have to pay for pictures, the whole thing, or reading other stories.",
      "THIS APP IS AMAZING! You don't need to wait to read the second half of the story and you don't have to pay a monthly subscription to see the pictures! But I do recommend just one change though. Can you please make the pictures real and not with emojis? I mean the real life pictures are super creepy but the emojis are just a big nope. If you could change that then I will change that last star to be green!",
      "I love this app it's easy to read and gives you as much time as you need to read the texts! So creepy as well great story's to tell to people if you want to scare them anyway! Idk if the story's are true or not (probably not) but they are very entertaining!",
      "It is a great app if u like scary romantic weird stories but the only thing that is took 1star is bc if u try to read a story again it will not let u and u can read as long as u want no cost at all and you have a great variety of storys to choose from so if you like to listen to music while you r reading this is a great app for you and ty for reading this long paragraph"

      "Nice app. Very quick . I like it but I found that Phone Pe rarely gives cash bach , hence I am using more often, Amazon app , which gives frequent cash back , even though , it is not a match to Phone Pe. Please , increase your cash back frequency , so that we may be associated for long time to come with Phone Pe .",
      "The app now has become completely unbearable. Though I have a very old phone on which I am having the app, but even the rival app, which also takes the time to load, works okay once loaded. You can navigate on that app anywhere and everywhere, but not on this. Initially, this app was great and guess what I liked it as it was smooth on my phone, but now it seems the continuous updates has made this app completely useless.",
      "Phonepe is most useful application for payments because it doesn't require to charge any transaction, say 5%. Its pretty good. But phonepe should also add a section of nearby payments so that it doesn't require to send or give any personal information, such that of Google pay, But would hope that you will add nearby payments options. I think its the easiest way to send money to, such as vegetable seller, or any unknown persons'..",
      "My phone pay app is stuck at a point , it opens to home page and then redirects to the pop up saying enter security pin, pattern or code but not able to enter any of the following and clicking on cancel , app closes. (Seems more like app crash)Please look into the issue.not able to use the app. I have reinstalled also but same issues there.",
      "Not good app.... It does not give a good service to customers. It's my fault that I use this app...Google pay and Paytm is far better than this. I suggest my friends plz don't use this app for transfer money. Most of times, it stops payment. My 15000rs is pending for last 8 days. I don't know when I get my money back."

      "i love this game. this became my fav bts messenger game even tho theres a lot more other similar games to this. i literally love everything about this game. its quite interesting and i also really like the romance plots. i want to see more from you, author. you did a good job but it would be nice if you have more mini games, photos or more details to the contact. so please do add these things in the next update! anyways loved it ♡",
      "I love it! I honestly think that you have all of the members personalities down. I also think that what they say in the game is something they would actually say irl! The gameplay is smooth like it has never crashed/frozed or anything like that!💜💕",
      "I love this app so much! Personally, I like the second one better than the first. It has much more to do. Also, the calls are more interactive than the first one. I hope a third one will come out soon! Or maybe even a Stray Kids one.",
      "I understand you gurl! I just saw your explanation on the \"Its too short\" and i completley love your game! Sure it may be short, but you inspired me. I was not really a big fan of BTS, but i downloaded this game because i was curious. I am so glad i did because YOU inspired me to be a fan of BTS! I am now an ARMY!! Thank you! (Please relpy TwT) 🥰🥰",
      "This game is really a must for me, I really really love it 💖💖 but there's only a problem though, I just hope that you'll add more options to pick whenever you text one of the members and also for the music to but so anyways it's a very fun game 😊💖"

      "The stories are cool, the adds aren't in the worst part possible so you can read without getting mad unless it's just the stories fault. It's nice being able to read without a lot of trouble...and I like how the stories are short and then if you get to part to or whatever it would be fine if you just stopped. Another good thing about this app is that it saves you progress a lot better than any other chat story app that I have had before!",
      "Its great but a menu for choosing a story would help and for the texts to be proof read so nothing is wrong AND i would like some unquie storys all the ones ive gotten ive read off of other apps like this but spelling and words were missing and once the wrong person sent a massege that the other should have. Its greate if you havent been on other apps like this but kinda lacking that polish to it you know its kinda lacking in alot of places",
      "I love this app so much. The only bad thing is is that there is a lot of adds that pop up. Also the whole thing is free. You do not have to pay for the epesodes unlike some apps. Also you get 2 choses of what theme you want. 1 is scary the other is steamy. I love this app and i would 100% recomend it. Hope this helped.",
      "This app freaks me out so much that I have nightmares when I go sleep but other than that the app is kind of cool.You can read different stories which gives me goosebumps.This app is meant for people that like horror movies and escape rooms. Thanks you for taking your time to read this.But for real this app is actually fun.",
      "Its a very good app it doesnt have a lot of adds and the stories are actully scary and i love them plus they dont take long to read but i wish there was more stories because there really is not a lit of stories but over all its a very good app"

      "This is a great app. It REALLY does provide FREE long distance calling, WITHOUT having to earn credits! BUT, I have had THREE problems with this app; 1) Very often, I am not able to hang up, after dialing a number! 2) Quite often, after about two or three minues, the calls are cut off right in middle of my conversation! 3) There does not seem to be any technical support!",
      "It sucks. Plain English. When I first installed it, It worked pretty good... as long as I had a good Wi-Fi signal. Now, it makes calls by itself or I'll try to reject a call, knowing that they won't hear me, and it won't do it. It keeps calling me and calling me and calling me. When I've asked the people if who were calling me off they called me just now five times, they'll say \"No, just the one time.\" I'll get text messages a day later, the mute and hold buttons get clicked constantly",
      "Great App. I moved from the city to the mountains and couldn't get dependable reception. I was suggested this app and tried it out. It works perfect. As long as you have a WIFI signal you will be able to call receive calls text and pic message. I like it so much that I've upgraded to the $2.99 a month and plan and use this as a perment means of communication now.",
      "Meh, I had higher hopes for this app based on all the 5 star reviews, but was disappointed with my experience. Constant ads EVERYWHERE, sometimes multiple ads on one screen, and most of them take up half my screen, which is excessive, and beyond annoying. It frequently stalls on a solid black screen anytime I try to do anything, when u choose a contact it doesn't pick their default number, it picks the first number you added to that contact. Also, setting the background has never worked for me.",
      "It's a decent free text & calling app, which works over WiFi or Mobile Data equally well. I've also upgraded to premium, which improves the app's versatility, but the free service is a complete product without requiring it to be premium, like a lot of other text & calling apps out there. So, that being said, I bet you're like, \"He rated it 4☆ out of 5☆ though, what's the catch?\" The 4☆ rating is cuz to keep the same cell# from changing you must text or call at least once every 3 days or...poof!"

      "This app is incredibly useful for videos. It shows the time !!! When put in the names there is someone named you and that's you your textes you send are green the other \"person\" known as the other character's colour is white you can send pictures without paying!!! There is a switch thing where you change the character it is almost like whatsapp but not with real people!",
      "I have no trouble.. Up until I send a picture??? Really?? I was working on a chat story. I sent like 3 pictures in a row and it crashes 2 seconds after. I went back into the story multiple times and I keeps crashing. Cleared my cache. Restarted my device. And tried again. It showed up for a second and crashed again. Every other chat story is fine but that one just crashes and crashes. 5 stars if that didn't happen.",
      "The app is awsome all and all but I'd like it more if it didn't crash when you want to edit a text and if you could tap to read your story. Overall the apps great tho!",
      "I like this app, just sometimes it crashes but that's alright. But you really need to fix that if you don't it to happen. Despite that, this app is amazing! Just meed some more improvements.",
      "Fun and good but after 3 or 4 days making my story i cant continue making it because if i click that story it will go back to my home screen (im sorry but understand my english im bad at english)"

Got great potential - just needs a bit of work 😊",

      "This is very well app. This gives me a second mobile number from which i can do my office work or can prank with friends . This also provide us 20 minute free calling to place a call. its cost for more than 20 minute is more cheaper than other there are no advertisement for which we can irritate . There are no many formalities to do . Thank to the app developer for this app Thank you",
      "They give you temporary phone numbers, with varying expiration dates on your free account, so expect the number to expire, as they want you to buy a premium account. Customer service is also very hostile, with a holier than thou attitude. If you use this free app, expect to have to get new phone numbers constantly, no matter how often you use it. I strongly recommend you pay for the premium service. I am very happy with it, and the phone number does not change on renewal, as most other voips do",
      "Works wonderfully awesomely amazingly good!. Best phone app out of the 15 or so I tried. You get the odd full screen ad, WHICH IS ANNOYING AS HELL (devs?) but there are no ad timers, so you just close the ad with the x in the corner. I've Never had a dropped call and voice clarity is always excellently superbulous! No echos, no delays! I give two thumbs up and straight A's.. Plus the name of the app is low key and not some dumb name like oomoo which I wud b embarassed to say outloud to someone",
      "Well I installed the app then attempted to sign up (which in fact I was able to only half do.) I got my user name and password in and then it asked to choose an area code. I did... but it kept having an error then crashed. I reopened the app and attempted to log in. At which point it told me I had \"violated the terms of use\" which is pretty hard. Because I NEVER used the app...",
      "Actually a very handy app. Could do without the advertisements. It is easy to install and is ready for use immediately after choosing your number to use. No hassle no difficult settings easy to use. I recommend anyone needing a second line for whatever reason including privacy this is the app."

Let's start the game and try to gain more diamonds, with which you can exchange for the decorations. Tap the \"Game\" icon in the middle of the screen and complete the mini-games one by one. Bathing, dress-up, feeding…and some training like hurdle race will help the horse become stronger, just tap the button at the right moment to complete the hurdles. After that, let's go experience the fun of magic items. You can click the crystals in a certain order to create beautiful music. Or draw a magic circle to see what unexpected things will happen.

      "Not good.. After the latest update.. You can't reply to messages right away unless you exit the app and go back in.. And it will take a few seconds or more to load it so you can reply to a message.. If you needed to hurry to reply to a message in emergency.. I say your out of luck.. Don't waste time with this app! You'll regret it if you do! I'm not kidding! Months later and still not working! And all these fake 5 star reviews on here by the developers are ridiculous! Update did NOT fix issue!",
      "This used to be a really great app. The last few updates have sucked. I hate the fact that for the past few updates, I have to click on a notification then exit out of the program then restart the program to reply to whoever sent me a message. As of the last update I have lost all notification sound. No matter what I've tried I cannot seem to get the sound back. So now I have to constantly check my phone to see if anyone has messaged me. I hope they fix this app soon as I paid for it",
      "*EDIT* my virus protection is now recognizing GoSMS as malware. I used to love this app but has completely fallen apart. I can no longer send photos and the message popup is so buggy it causes me to force close the app. I've even somewhat looked past the fullscreen pop up ads (that i find to be pretty unsafe in an emergency situation).",
      "I've been using this app for a couple of years, after last update can't send text messages at all, which turned out to be quite a drama as I didn't know they were not being sent and delivered! I'm waiting for an update, but at present cannot use this app and my annual payment has not long been made. Very disappointing considering the number of complaints on this issue in the review comments.",
      "Not happy withrecent updates, now my messages don't make a sound,, and about half of the time when I start responding to a message the send button is still grey so u can't hit send so I have to copy my message, go out of app and come back in to send message. I used to love this app it was second to none but lately it's just a headache I've read the same complaint by other people and hope the developer actually pays attention to these comments and might be able to fix theses issues"

      "Fun, but crashes so much. Kept having to reboot it and every time I'd lose money. Don't think it's my phone because everything else works.",
      "its overall a great game! but one thing that i dont find the use of is if you get a gift from other people you cant open it for 10h or so. not a big problem. and something else that would be helpful is organizing the shop's mixed horse breeds. i found horses i can buy randomly scattered with no real organization for it to be easier to find them. another not big problem but will make the game easier.",
      "It crashes a lot, plus there's a little thing that takes you to another game at all times, but other than that it's fine.",
      "It's an awesome game😍 I like it and i love it too much 😍 I can't start my day without checking it 😂 And i have some ideas to this game Like a bottom to show all the ponies (adults or not) of each room and if we can add a bottom to show all the ponies of the game. And Thanks ❤",
      "I wish you could level up more quickly and have more stuff to do,and it probably needs to be updated with maybe new mini games for you and your ponys to play,like dress up or targeting stuff while riding your pony. somthing like that would make it more fun to play."

      "Great game, conversations are very realistic, pics are great!! Some of the wait times are a bit long but understandable. The endings of some are a bit sudden, but mostly understandable, would love to be able to continue these stories...maybe a sequel?!?",
      "It was really good like everyone's story I think for the next update it should make the stories longer and get more pictures on how far you go in to there story but the game was really good it would be cool tho if you could write your own response",
      "An app that might be worth paying for *if* the reply times for paid characters were 1, 3, and 7 minutes, not *hours* for each and every message. Leilani returns instantaneously from a night's sleep or days work. What should be a back and forth conversation with Starr is now in its 2nd day, approaching 24 hours. Reply times should be in tune with the type of conversation.",
      "Very fun and clever. It's more like a choose your own adventure than a chat bot, really. The pics, delay in messages, and audio files are great touches. It would be cool, too, if there were more possible questions and outcomes but I know that's a lot more work. It also would be cool if there was more than just one free option, but that just goes to show it's a good fun idea",
      "This game is amazing, the conversation, the realistic photos make conversations more real, I almost fell in love with Leilane.... that's the only problem, having to pay to be able to release other conversations is a little bad, I can't pay. I really wanted to know how the other stories end, but it was worth the experience, I hope you can help me with this problem. Thx"

      "I would like to know one thing: I have everything updated and play this on a Note 8. The game takes well over a minute to load and it is very frustrating between that and the pulls from the mystery boxes seem to be the same 10 ponies. If these two issues sort themselves out, I would happily give this a higher rating.",
      "Itz ok, itz fun, but kinda hard. Also, i hate having to pay to level up! I dont have that many bits, and when i do challenges over again i get bits, but that just gives my ponies more exp! Also, after a level it told me to pay 43 gems to level up faster. I have 50 gems, but i wanna save them. I had to close the game and start again. But after i played a level, it told me the same thing! Plz fix, so tired of needing to pay to level up and that popup. Overall, itz an ok game.",
      "I really like the game but can you add no time limits until the next enemy arrived because it's very annoying and it's very frustrating I never get to go anywhere else besides pinkies stage I never ever defeated anybody else until pinky pi I tried to get on to the other levels but the other are so hard I never get to defeat anyone else",
      "I had started playing this game on my sons amazon fire tablet, helping him out when he was struggling. Wanted to play it for myself so downloaded onto my phone. These are 2 completely different versions and I much prefer the way the amazon fire version is set up so you can buy which pony you want. I am stuck because I need an orange pony to complete the next stage. I've replayed the previous stages a million times saving up gems and each time I still don't get an orange base pony.",
      "I really like the game and wish more people played it but I have a problem. In the quests there is this thing that says \"complete applejack's first master challenge.\" I already completed the first and second one and I think I must've done it before that quest showed up so it doesnt show that I completed it and it's stuck there forever. Still rating this five stars because the other official gameloft app requires you to literally spend thousands of dollars if you want to collect everything."

      "where do i start, first off you have to download more to get any style with more ads, and then when they pop up i couldn't just close the ad no matter how many times i hit the x it took me to the ad on my browser, I could not get into setting, it would highlight but do nothing, even outside the app i had ads, I deleted, don't waste your time unless you like ads you can never get rid of, i might have paid .99 for no ads, but even free comes with a price in this case....",
      "this probaby the only app that works. when you type emojis it shows as iPhone emojis. its really great. but yes you have to download another app for it to work, but it needs the other app to know which one is the messenger desplay you want. so idk why people would complain. its honestly the best app I came apon. (I am not a fake commenter or robot, just giving real feedback😂) also just download the other app, then go to this one once its complete and boom it works. most people didn't do that.",
      "I give it 1 star because it makes you have to download a whole lot of other apps that just take up a lot of space on your phone. Don't use this app unless you don't want it download any games👿👿",
      "if I could give zero stars I would, you download the app and then it's just more ads like nobody wants to deal with that and having to download more apps. it's stupid, I recommend not using this app.",
      "I hate it it makes.me download a app only to use it and it also makes my screen look like a Samsung when it said it was gonna look like a iPhone If I could give it a zero I would"

      "Does everything it should. Works nicely. One star off because I would buy a pro version, but not for £10.49, that is way too steep for this kind of thing. So, another star off cos I need to suffer ads without being able to buy a reasonably priced full version. However, this free version is good enough; I wonder how much money the devs have missed out on due to having such a highly priced pro version.",
      "Phone doesn't ring. I've noticed that quite a few people have voiced this issue, but there has been no response. So what's the problem? Can it be fixed? No ring tone...no fake call!",

I still have the same Google account, ph number , even service provider. Feeling rather ripped off",

      "Used to work great but since last update I can't control who the call comes from. I have emailed back and forth with the developer with no change to the app. I have paid for pranks a few tones but i won't again and i suggest you don't either. Developer: I have contacted you multiple times and you guys just keep telling me to uninstall and install the app back. That doesn't work!!!",
      "I bought credits a while back but had to uninstall and reinstall the app only to discover the credits I bought were gone. I talked to customer service to retrieve the credits I paid for and was never given them. You also have to choose a number from a list instead of being able to put your own in now. This obviously greatly decreases the chance of anyone answering. Avoid this app.",
      "I have emailed the developer with my issues. At first it was fun. I was able to call and prank people with other people phone numbers now I'm not allowed. Secondly I paid to have credits when the app was fun. I upgraded my phone and poof all my credits are gone. PLEASE GIVE ME A REFUND OR CORRECT THE ISSUE. THANKS"

      "Overall, this game is very likeable and I love playing it on the road since it does not need WiFi or data. I feel that a lot of the critical reviews are too harsh on the game and its creators. One said that she would leave bad reviews on every one of their games, even if they didn't play them first! Which I feel is an exhausting task that might not even affect the overall rating! The only reason I give only 4 stars is because it gets a little less exciting after playing it for awhile.",
      "To all those who are saying that this app doesn't work then suck yourself when you want to use it just activate your data then when it is open you can switch off your data we are not in the colonial episode you guys should be aware that there is something known as WiFi and data bundles so come back to2020 and live life like a human sky whale is so entertaining for those who understands it",
      "#good it works and i am so far in the sky some time,s it,s so fun i play it a lot of time,s and it is still fun i want you to play it so you can have fun and it doesn't need wifi i hope you like the game and give it 5 stars to play store i want pleas not 1 star (that's very bad) want then nobody wanna to play it then so give it 5 stars bye bye",

What no one knows is that you’ve always longed for a girlfriend. You envied your friends ever since you found out they’re dating, and since then, you’ve never quite felt like you fit in.\r\n \r\nBut one day, an advertisement falls almost literally on your lap that seems to be the perfect answer to your desires. Why do you have to risk rejection when you can just rent a girlfriend? Out of desperation, you sign up, hoping for the chance to take a beautiful girl on a date and show your friends you’re not the loser they think you are.\r\n \r\nWhat you didn’t expect, though, was falling in love with them. And now you’re stuck in a messy circle of three rental girlfriends, who want to be your real girlfriend. But you can only choose one. Will it be the girl whom you want to save, whose kindness makes her deserve no less? Or your childhood friend, who’s trying to find her path in this world? Or will you choose the compelling, confident woman, who knows what she wants - and what she wants is you.\r\n \r\n■■Characters■■\r\n \r\n◆ Celina\r\n \r\n“Even if there are hardships in life, I’ll always smile.”\r\n \r\nBeautiful, smart, and caring – Celina was never meant to be a rental girlfriend.

      "The art and game is so beautifully made but its kind of hard to progress fairly with only one option being available to choose from and one paying option. At least maybe give us 2 free options when we cant pay for the obvious ones aside from tjat and having to wait a day for the story to continue i will give 4 stars :3",
      "5 stars also I want to point something out u made a spelling error it should say \"Once Tessa is sure he's gone, she rushes to me.\" when u do the intervere option with tom and Tessa's Date but instead it says \"Once Tessa is sure She's gone, she rushes to me\" just wanted to point that out for ya",
      "Is there some sort of text log? Because accidentally skipping over the text and having to restart the game just to read it properly is totally not cool. That said that's the only problem I have with the game.",
      "Cool game 😎 it reminds me of how I met my GF. Don't worry she is the only one and not a Rental hahaha. Keep up the good work and I'm looking forward to the other simulators you made😉",
      "The storyline of this game is typical, with a main character where everyone likes him. Whoever, despite that I find myself bonding with the girls. As for the ads, they are not intrusive. Even without paying money for this game, the experience is still enjoyable. I recommend this to anyone who wishes to download this game."

      "At times exasperating as the app does not not continue with the transfer when being interrupted by WiFi. The app should simply ignore all interruptions and continues with the process. This is my main frustration, otherwise OK.",
      "Terrible, says on the new phone at the bottom that \" this is the old phone\". Don't know how it made that determination, and I'll tell you, it really stuck to it because the app would not do absolutely anything other than say that.",
      "Clean installed on new LG V50. Opened app and it does not show a choice screen. Just defaults to This is the old phone! Retried installing a few times and made sure the app permissions are all granted. Still no way to set This is the New phone...help please",
      "Why password again when the code has already been scannned? Huawei cares too much of the User protecting the hardware and software from the User himself. Security is more important than the human. The most of apps are not supported or non-transferable.",

      "You used to be able to pick what number you wanted the call to come from. Now it just says private number. Only other option is to use your own number or creating a fake number using a very low rated app it takes you to. Worse, if the call is rejected, the prank leaves a voicemail cluing in the recipient. Avoid this app. It's been downgraded. I want my six dollars back."

      "All burner numbers I used to have worked for SMS and other verification services that allowed to stay anonymous for personal reasons be it safety or otherwise. Now not a single number can be used for the original intent, use, and functionality. Will be looking for a better service that allows for the full use of numbers as originally able to do. At the current usefulness of the app it's nothing more than an expensive quickly thrown out number that has zero usefulness unless you simply plan on ghosting people for dates or something else that's pretty lame.",
      "I love this app. After free trial it is still very affordable. It works perfect to keep up with people that your required to speak to a person via court order, but do not need them getting your regular phone number. It is able to change, therefore allowing you to not have unwanted spam calls and prank calls very often!",
      "was a good app. Paid auto renew for 3 lines on Googlle play store. Google says it renews Mar 3rd. Today is Feb 10. The app says subscription lapsed, expired. Guess they took my money and ran. Cant get a hold of their support either. Use to be a 5 star app. Now just a theif. Update: was not resolved. Uninstalled.",
      "I've noticed after getting a response to text it was displayed briefly in the box then returned to the last text I sent. If I wouldn't of noticed this I would of never known the other party responded. Kinda defeats the point. I also get the filling my text dont always go threw right away nd vice versa since the responses seem relevant to the message I sent the message not received the response",
      "Auto reply text doesn't appear to be working, but other than that, it's good. Edit : I bought a subscription and it does appear to work. I'm a little confused on what Subscription Line and Prepaid Line is, I bought both. Is there a simple answer? I'm liking it so far!"

And 2. Why should you have to watch yet ANOTHER BORING AD To unlock more slots?! It is just insane! Why not have endless slots? What if you want to create an avatar OFFLINE and you have not enough slots? But anyway, apart from that I am mostly satisfied. Just if you could fix those things, I'll upgrade to 5*'s.",

    "description":"Mock Locations allows you to fake information about the location of your phone by GPS and network operator.\r\n\r\n\t  You simply navigate the route on the map and press the \"Go!\" to have all of the application on your phone to give fake information about the location.\r\n\r\n\t  This will help in the development of applications or if you want to, no one knew where you are really.\r\n\r\nAttention! Before purchasing the full version of the application check the performance on your device. For this purpose there is a free trial period of 24 hours after installing the app. During this time, you can use the premium features (Hide the application using \"Hide Mock Locations\", or move the app to the system partition and run without setting Allow mock location).

(The free version of the application, this function is available for 24 hours after installation.)\r\n\r\n\tTo do this you need to move the application to the system partition. This is most easily done by using \"System App Converter\" program.\r\n\t\r\n\tJust move the application to the system partition can be manually (Using Root Explorer):\r\n\tOn Android 2.3.3 - 4.3: move the file \"ru.gavrikov.mocklocations.apk\" from the folder \"/data/app\" in the folder \"/system/app\" and reboot the device.\r\n\tOn Android 4.4 - 4.4.4: move the file \"ru.gavrikov.mocklocations.apk\" from the folder \"/data/app\" in the folder in the folder \"/system/priv-app\" and reboot the device.\r\n\t\r\n\tEven you can hide Mock Locations app work on other applications (in this case they will not see what is on tick \"Allow mock locations\").

It works through the Xposed framework.\r\n\t\r\nThere are times when your jump coordinates to the actual location. This happens on some devices after the application was transferred to the system partition.\r\n First solution: \r\nIn the setting of the device to enter in Location tab and turn off location for wireless networks.

      "I believe this is the app that I gave 1 star to because I had you confused with another one. Been meaning to come back and apologize but things have been hectic as you may understand. I haven't even tried this search engine but if it takes me where Google doesn't it's 5 stars! Sorry again, old white lady boomer!",
      "A seamlessly working app that showcases all most all of search engines. But a bit lagging in it's performance which can be overcomed",
      "The BEST THING about this app is that you can use it to get other EXTREMELY USEFUL apps that you will NEVER find on Google Play because of its policies AND NOT SEARCHING WITH GOOGLE because of its search limitations. RECORD BOTH SIDES of a phone convo for inst. There is MORE FREEWARE out there than there is in GP with alot LESS HEADACHES. Just be safe. USE THE LOOKUP with the same search terms, just add NOT GOOGLE PLAY to the end and viola! FIND ALL THE STUFF you knew was always out there!",
      "In this day and age, this app is a caveman. Too much work, too confusing. It's like the difference between a professional football player and a little league player. I don't want thousand names and try to pick the right one. Be a lot better if a person could put in last known City or something like that. Too generic for me. I'd rather go back to my paid searches.",

      "If your business runs on text messages like rental business, you need this App! It downloads text msgs into pdfs. But its wonky. So for a samsung phone for USB connection, you have to install their USb drivers on the Windows 10 OS. You will have answer alot of questions on the cell phone, but the not apps fault. I found if you make any setting changes, its quicker to shut down /restart W10 app and andriod phone app. Use trial version to ensure connection, then buy it.",
      "I wish i could give you less than 1 star. Trying to make a backup of a conversation where someone threatens your life and every time this app says its done nothing shows up in the destination folder. Money wasted and I still have no backups to show for it.",
      "Yes! its great to be able save text messages from my phone to my laptop. Can also print messages out and does more when you purchase an Activation code. I think its great.",
