      "I love it! I really appreciate you guys for taking the time to create a app for our photos. I have one problem though... sometimes when I get on the app and try to edit my photos it says that Google Photos isn't responding. I have reset it multiple times,but it still stays the same. It might just be the type of phone I have. Overall I think that this is a great app!",
      "Very good app. I use it for all my photos. Amazing for sharing and good for organizing albums. I recently got problems though, because some photos in albums are sorted incorrectly (but only on the phone and in the browser it's correct) and some albums are not fully synced in the app, means that I added photos, but online they do not appear in the album and the number of photos listed to the album is incorrect.",
      "This app works fine until you try organizing your gallery in any kind of way. Folders randomly disappear all the time; the photos are still there, but somehow the entire folder is lost. Only some of the pictures show up in the area where you can separate them into folders or albums. There is also no eraser for markup but otherwise, editing pictures is fairly easy.",
      "I love the app, first it has this intelligence that makes you to be able to search for any category of a picture you want. Just go to search and type anything like \"laughing\" \"swimming\" \"driving\" or even specify \"Michael driving\" \"Glory swimming\" etc. Also, the app has plenty of storage, you can backup all your life in there. The problem is, its somehow slow to upload allot of items, but it will struggle to finish up. Its nice.",
      "So like I stopped using this for the exact reason I'm here to day. This dam app is a pain in my rump I stopped using it a long time ago. I'm guessing the only reason why this popped up is because it's the only app that will play my videos from my SD card. For some reason it overpowers Samsung photos and I have a Samsung phone... Man I wish this would stop updating every so many days I don't use it I don't like it."

I'm guessing that if I paid for the full version, I'd be lost in there forever because it gives you so many options and different ways to customize said options. Never a bad thing when it comes to editing. Genuinely pleased with this app, and pleasantly surprised at its expansive capabilities (even though I've only explored the free portions). I recommend everyone try it out at least.",
      "Love the app! I like to make memes etc. And this gives me many more options than my phones' editor. I like all the effects i can add, and even if you don't have premium you still have lots of options! It is very good and i will continue to use it in the future and i recommend any ameture editors use it to. It's very simple and easy to use",
      "So far I've only used the blur feature to get a tilt shift effect on some pictures, but I love how much I can customize the shape and strength of that effect. I haven't explored all of the features yet, but it looks like this app will be able to replace 2 of my other apps; a filter app and a collage app, and still have more features than those 2 combined.",
      "Good app but could be better by the developers adding a feature that tells you if your text or photo added on top of another layer is central or not. When you re-size a photo that you've added, the photo most of the time rotatrs and spins so you can't always tell if it is straight or not. Other than that, a fantastic app.",
      "I've really been enjoying all the things I can do with my photos with this app. It's been fun playing with all the features - and there are a LOT of them: hues, blurs, brightness, various cropping tools, saturation, text, stickers, effects, and many more!"

      "I've been using this app for over 3 years and to be honest, theres so much more you can do than just add texts to photos.... I'm a graphic designer so I guess any tool can be awesome in the hands of the right person... I would however like If I was able to undo an action as well as be able to edit the added image like tap and bring it above everything....also it would be amazing if the ad free option came with the image packs and be able to share editable templates.",
      "I really love this app it works perfectly for my YouTube videos and also maybe you guys could add in like where you can make your own image like you can make a different background like a picture of the outdoors or something and you can design your own image for it and maybe you can make them smaller for a front screen of a YouTube video",

      "Very nice app and it's easy to use. It has less ads. I use it to create image and picture messages which I posted in FB messenger Story and also in Facebook. I will give it a 5 Stars if you'll add a Cut and Paste feature. Kudos to the developers!"

      "Does what I need and the only issue I have is the numerous ads, but i also run the free version, so it comes with the territory of a free app versus paid version. Using this app because it's a pretty good app and make altering my photos, pretty easy and straightforward without being too much.",
      "love this app, I love creating new images and layers....has some amazing effects most of which I may never have thought of....it's great thanks....... I only use this app for my photos now, I edit them and get them printed. They make great photos to print and display..... The only thing I would change is the monthly fee..... I would rather pay for the year instead of having the fee come out of my mobile bill each month.... Not that its expensive. The developers obviously put a lot of work in",
      "Overall this app is decent for editing pictures. However I would like to make a suggestion to add a bookmarking feature on this app to bookmark your favorite filters that you use mostly. Because many times it becomes a lot of work to go to each and every section to find the combinations you used the previous time.",
      "So, I usually just post my stars rating for apps. And I definitely have a fair number of editing apps for photos and videos, most of which, are soon uninstalled after falling short of being anything that stands out in the sea of editing apps. So I had to leave a comment about how unique and flawless this app has been. Totally blown away by all the creative minds that put it together. I also enjoy trying to find my own \"inner artist\" by using multiple combinations of edits.THANKS 👍🏻👍🏻",
      "Decided to try the free trial & see if this photo app was any different from the many available & wasn't disappointed. There is a wide variety of options to enhance your photos, from frames to filters to photo props for you and your pets! I enjoyed the trial so much that am planning on purchasing in the future. Definitely worth a try!"

      "This app is great- I have tried so many of the photo editing apps on Google Play, and this is by far the best one. It has the perfect suite of resources to edit pictures beautifully, and the ads are perfectly unobtrusive. Great job to the developers!",
      "Once a great product. Now has LESS functions with more ads in latest version. (You can't resize file size anymore..handy when sending large photos). Will be uninstalling and seeking alternative.",
      "After last update is freezing every 5 min. Is my only edit app because it has it all. U really don't need any other apps, but please, fix it.",
      "It used to work great on my old phone but since I've gotten a new phone the app doesn't work that well. It often doesn't save my pictures when I'm done editing. Sometimes it starts saving but doesn't complete the process and no file is saved, and other times when I press \"done\" and want to save it it just undos all my edits and reverts to the original. I used to be able to click \"done\" and chose to save the file or share it in another app, this function also no longer appears!"

      "i really like this app it has a variety of filters,a lot of stickers and multiple photo editting tools but its just that you have to get Lumii Pro just to get the other filters and stuff and you actually have to pay a lot just to use it.I REALLY like this app,it has helped me a lot,but the price is just a little high and theres this thing where everytime I save a pic an ad suddenly pops up,thats pretty much all I can say about this app",
      "I can see why so many of the reviews of this app are so glowingly positive! Very high-quality results, easy to use. I like the way all of the edits are cumulative, and yet you can use the history button to selectively block out each category of edits (the adjustments or filters or effects, etc.), to see how that affects the project. That feature alone gives you much more control than is usual in this type of app.",
      "Update...still the same, bugs me to give a review right away which I HATE, but I like the app. Original review...I may end up buying the ad free version after I have a chance to use this ap a few times. Number one, even for an ap with ads, there are way way too many ads and its very frustrating when you are working on photos, and second, give me a break please, I just downloaded this ap and right away you want me to review it! Thus the three stars, for now.",
      "This app is great for taking photos of all sort! Selfies! Landscapes! Food and much more! It gives that effect that you are a professional photographer which is amazing! Over all this is a great app that I recommend for someone who wants to post nice pictures!",
      "I have to give the creators of this app six stars for not only creating an amazing app with endless possibilities but they give you enuff with the free version to prove the apps integrity and worth which makes you feel like you will get something worthwhile if you purchase the paid version.. Many apps give you a disfunctional version of their app and basically tell you that you have to pay them to even see if you want the app or not.. which doesnt make me comfortable paying.but this ill pay for!"

      "Bad Sign-In. Yeah, any tool that needs a membership, free or otherwise, is the Yankee Screwdriver of the app world. It looks good boxed on the shelf. You can easily convince yourself that it will help you get more done, but when you get it home and try to actually use it, your project becomes a hopeless exercise in futility. Go ahead, chase your tail creating memberships to log in to an app that might work as claimed. Oops, it doesn't. They bought their Porsches by selling your data.",
      "This keeps crashing on my chromebook. I have to keep restarting my laptop after editing every couple of photos. This has been happening for a few months now so I had expected it to be fixed by now. It also tells me that my file is unsuported or damaged which again, restarting my chromebook fixes this issue but I don't want to restart after every two photos edited. Once this is resolved, I will change my rating to 5 stars.",
      "It's definitely what it says it is, it's a light weight, mobile friendly version of photoshop. It's definitely targeted more towards photography enhancements than anything else though, so don't expect it to let you do all of the things its desktop big brother is capable. It does have a lot of neat filters that I wish were available out of the box with the full version though and the UI is much more intuitive for new users. My only big gripe is that it doesnt seem to let you delete photos.",
      "The blemish fix used to be fantastic but now it exacerbates the issues. You have no control over where the \"fix\" or blend is coming from and it chooses areas with like color, which doesn't vary. It just KEEPS choosing the wrong source. If your trying to fix a sunbeam on your face, it's going to create a sun smear. If you're trying to fix a stray hair, you'll wind up with a hairy sky, and so on. This feature was what made this app great. It's no longer a go to app due to this frustration.",
      "I'm impressed both with the results and the design. Having moved from Windows to Linux, I'm more familiar with GIMP than PhotoShop. Having said that, I found all functions easy to find and use. Hints are worded in a way that non-technical photographers can understand the purpose of the selected option. Very thoughtful. Results seem very good as far as I can tell on a small screen. A few minor moans like not being able to locate storage on SD card, but still wyalifies fir 5 stars."

      "Good but irritation at some times. (1) File explorer is very bad. When user tries to add new images, it does not show many images. Instead of such buggy default file explorer, they should allow users to choose different file explorers present on user's device to find and select desired image. (2) When user put two text boxes in image, writes simple text in one box and writes only emoji in second box and saves it, the final images does not show text box which had emoji. Pls resolve these issues.",
      "Its simplistic and fin to use however, the free backgrounds could do with less unicorns, pink, blue, plants and fruit designs, also add richer colours like reds, mustards, greens greys, rust, black oranges, some decent frames or borders, i personally would then go for the pro version. The more useful a free app is, the more likely people would buy the app. Just an idea. I enjoy the app, its great and its design and usefulness is super. Thanks for such a well rounded, useful app.",
      "it's honestly pretty good! however.. there's a glitch where photos show up in the preview as another photo i had saved, and i have to click edit to check which photo it actually is. since i make collages with this app, it's becoming more and more incredibly bothersome and difficult trying to memorize which photos are which, that it's made me rate it only two stars. i appreciate if you could try and fix it, since it's the only major issue i really see with it. it's quite a good app otherwise!",
      "Was using free version, downloaded free fonts. All worked fine. Paid to download pro and I can no longer use all the fonts I previously downloaded. It says \"use\" next to them, but when I press Use, it doesn't change the font. Have emailed 5 times to get this resolved and no answer. So now I have paid for the upgrade and have access to LESS features. Someone please email me to fix this (I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app a dozen times and still have the problem)",
      "Oh, wow, I am loving this app! Only just downloaded it an hour ago, but I am having so much fun with the collages! And I finally got an adjustement on a pic I had but was never quite satified with. Think I'll come back on payday and make it Pro....and I don't usually like subscriptions, prefer to buy. :-)"

      "Photo Studio is a fantastic app for anything you'd like to do with a photograph, it a pity they don't do a version like this for editing videos in the same style, I'm really pleased with Photo Studio and would really recomend it, as for ads, they don't bother me, it only takes a few seconds and they're gone, plus there are not that many.",
      "I've tried TONS of editing apps! They start great, and typically, just when you get into it, there are suddenly tons of stipulations & restrictions. Haven't had that problem yet.

      "Thank you for fixing my issue! Should have more stars so I could rate 10 stars! Best app by far, easy to use, great editing tools, best fonts, fantastic! I'm so glad I found this app, it puts all the others to shame. Keep it up guys! ,"

Thank you A+ developers",

      "This photo gallery works wonders ....it works better than any APP I have had so far! Now that says a lot, so far! It is fast like Lightning!",
      "Turned all permissions on and it still won't move photos to SD drive. The pop up telling one how to do that doesn't show an SD card even though the gallery shows them. Pretty disappointed considering the hype of 4.7 Stars. Not impressed whatsoever. Deleted. On to the next one because ..l., Google. The people hate your spy network which is why we use other apps!"

Here’s what’s in store for you:<br>• Select – a new feature in Eraser mode that allows you to select and apply changes to specific parts of your photos. Works in specific tools that utilize Eraser mode.<br>• VNYL3 – the third effect in the VNYL series for the FLTR category.<br>• Callout – new customizable iMessage speech bubbles in the Callout tool.",

      "No free part, EXPEN$$$IVE paid. Actually, no, it's not a free app. I tried to add text and save my picture, but there was no save option, only a 3 day free trial that requires me to sign up, probably give credit card information, spend 10 minutes to save a picture. So, no free part, just use the free Photoshop app or VSCO, or anything. The paid app costs too much, and there is no free app.",
      "If the app actually came with some directions it would be a huge help. I'm glad they don't build airplanes. Just jump in you'll figure it out. Free doesn't rate if it's unusable. Do people generally just come to your job site so you can show them? The sad thing is this is not uncommon. Apple, Google, all these bright individuals forgot to attach any directions. Cars are more user-friendly than this app. I'm done, my last app didn't have the bells and whistles but at least it was usable!",
      "It is quite uncomfortable to use.The phone gets hanged while doing editing of a picture basically when I click on effects,it appears to be black and get exit from that app..that also my phone is new!! not even 40%storage is full but it gives a feeling like some viruses has attacked.I have given two stars because the effects are good,also we can write n rub the unnecessary part,stickers and many more,we should download this app(so many professional features)..But please update this problem",
      "This app used to be the best when it came to mobile editing. But i have no idea what the hell is wrong with this app from a certain time. The new update is surely a big mess. I am unable to edit a single photo, apply a single effect. Every time after choosing a picture to edit, it just restarts again and again. Fix this guys, and make this app great again !!",
      "I used to love this app so so much and it still is amazing. I just personally don't need a lot of these new tools introduced last year. If you want to go wild and creative then sure they are pretty exciting! I just don't need them and still am restricted by them and the need to pay. I wanted to save a project I was working on and couldn't unless I paid a subscription. Great app, just be aware of the penetrating demand for you to subscribe. (Still, love it lots, thank you!)"

      "This application is so wonderful and it's app in the many features and it's very useful . I am using this application .",
      "It's a great alternative to a very popular gallery app. However, I have some suggestions: 1. Allow pictures to display in their original size (not fit to screen). So if, for example, the image is 400x400 pixels, allow it to be displayed using 400x400 pixels on the screen. If the photo is 2000x2000, then please allow the app to display it at the screen's resolution, even if it zooms in a little already. 2. In landscape mode, double tap doesn't zoom in. 3. This app feels slow.",
      "I like almost everything about this app; yet I have to give it 1 star! Why?! When scrolling amongst files, this FM show you files in (sub)folder(s) that you didn't open & aren't even looking at!? When I want to look at specific files that are in a, specific, folder I don't want to scroll & see files that are unrelated to the subject that I am researching/looking at. It is for this very reason that I put all files in specific folders. Is there a way to turn this off?! I'm about to uninstall.",
      "Well it served me well. No annoying ads like other galleries. I have two galleries on my phone because this app, doesn't have the drawing tool, for example I want to cross out some details on an image, I can't do that with this app. But apart from this, all is good. I can crop, i can create albums and move images from one album to another. It's offline and free.",
      "Loved it.... Didn't upgrade to pro right away.... And now 75% of my photos are gone and I do t know if I can get them back. Downloaded new version...photos still didn't reappear... I'm missing family vacation photos and entire folders of pics. I'm really sad. I emailed the developer... Hoping they have a solution."

      "Love the whole idea of this. Automatically stores your pics. Face ID, can group photos. Love it love it! Most bang for the buck. Never have to worry about losing photos. 3/2020 minus 1 star. Here we are 18 mos later & changes aplenty have been made. Not sure if I like them at all. The ease of integrating them into my needs just not there. Just because you can change things doesn't mean you should. Will keep trying for another 6 mos.",
      "So far it's been very good. Only issue I've encountered is the time it takes to review, choose and edit photos for printing. Appears to be an internet issue. Works better/faster at night. Must be related to the number of people on the website or app during the day. I had nearly 1200 photos printed in 3 batches and will receive the prints soon. Appears average of 3-4 days from order to delivery.",
      "what's this? an almost unusable app, no thumbnail overview, no drag n drop, no album/photo side by side, no grouping outside of nonsense \"image recognition\" AI blub. I am completely lost as to what use this app is supposed to provide. e. g. (really just a example) uploading to the cloud is bogus, it's simply doing a timeout on those selections you made, you can't correct the upload group while you are selecting but before the actual upload starts. WHO DESIGNED THIS?",
      "Frustrating! There are a lot of features missing from this app. A lot of features that would make my experience a lot better than what it currently is. The sort feature is extremely lacking and needs a ui overhaul. Why can't I hit \"create album\" And use a sort feature so I dont have to scroll through thousands of pictures.",
      "I have photos and videos all the way back from 2016 on my phone and the Amazon photo app wont go that far out to save them just the beginning of 2019 . I thought it was suppose to save ALL my photos and videos . Pretty disappointed . Please fix ! This app looks promising , only if it does its complete job as it described . Now I'm afraid to delete my stuff from my phone . I can't depend on this app ."

      "A problem with the upgrade. One small drawback is that I can't adjust the vignette tool to cover specific areas. And I wish you would create a video cam with the same skin softener filters. I am removing 1 star because sometimes and recently the flash doesn't load. I am frustrated. Why is this happening?? Will look for another app. Like today and I need the flash. Usually Lots of fun!!! Sweet and soft selfies. Love it. Plenty of free options.",
      "A Little Difficult to figure out, however it did what I needed, collaging it took a few tries to crop and paste over another image. More flexibility in the masking, maybe with a lasso tool, that would have saved some time. In the cutout mode, how do we move the background image to fit in the cutout?",
      "HALLLLOOOOHH!!!! Just re-installed this one yesterday after 10 months, and WHHOOOAAAAHH, she's a BLITZ!! All new features, functions, BRILLIANTLY IMPROVED creative options, fantastic and crisp picture results and very user-friendly navigation! And, yep, STILL ALL FOR FREE!! Bargain!! I thought this app was awesome 2 years ago when I first discovered it...now I'm TOTALLY HOOKED!!",
      "This app just took off R289 off my account for an annual subscription which I did not request. How do I get my money back????? I cannot repsond to your response. So here is my response: I cancelled it on the same day this app deducted the subscription. I never asked for an annual subscription. The only reason I have this app installed is so I can see your response.",
      "Being a hardcore photo editor, after sony closed it,s sketch apps I almost gave up doing photo editing,for all that I tried none could give editing satisfaction,until one day I was introduced to this Photo Director app by a friend. And kudos 4 stars (one reserved for me) I give to this apps and may it keep up it,s standard always above par from the rest. Thankyou for coming out with such a good apps."

Easy to use. Super reliable for all sorts of images, not just portraits, and a great selection of basic free filters. Ive tried many photo editors but I always fall back on this one.",
      "You can do so much without having to pay which is great. I use this app for basically all my photos, there's a lot of things you can do with it. Of course there could be more, which is why it's only 4 stars and not 5, but I've tested a lot of similar apps and haven't found one as good as this especially one that's free. I'd absolutely recommend it.",
      "Easy to use. You have everything you need for editing. However, when I use the tools a lot, my phone lags and the app crashes. I started over again to edit. 😔"

      "Wicked app. Easy to use. Only thing I would say if I was to change anything is once collage is made, it would be great if I was able to make the pictures bigger and smaller by stretching instead of tapping. As some became to big & cut out too much. But overall fantastic app",
      "I'm a total newbie, just checkin' this out. I had a bunch of different photos to put in one collage. I loved that each photo has option to resize and rotate or eliminate. The one option I wish this app had, is when layering a lot of photos into a collage, choosing just one photo causes it to be on top which is a real pain to have to go back and make all the corrections. Sending overlapping photos forward and backward. It needs the option to tap the photo again and send it to it's original place.",
      "Great app! Love how you have so many options for background colors and designs. I was looking for an app were I can adjust my own pictures on a black color background and this was perfect for it.",
      "It's a very useful app. I can do all my things without any pro version and it's damn easy to use but it's been 4 months since I'm using this and today I was not getting the stickers and I think it would be an update problem.. So.. Yet I'm updating it..lets see",
      "It is very fun and has many diffent things that i like but it loads very slow and i think that the templets don't have enought picture squares in each layout. It is pretty good other then that though and u think you could have an awsone time on it if you are looking for something like this."

However, their are lots of ads that take up some time and it is only a layout editor. So you will need to download a second editore with photos, save the photo and then add onto this editor.",
      "I enjoyed the app. The problem I see, is that it doesn't get updated according to different photo albums saved on your phone storage. I moved a folder of photos to another location. App is is trying to load from old folder (which is not there anymore) and Doesn't show the new folder. Crazy!",

      "Great app but lately, once I exit, there's a whole bunch of little pictures of the Suicide Squad (cartoon characters) appearing in my picture folder (downloads) and a bunny (cartoon/s) with different pictures of it in different settings. A pain in the arse to delete them, one by one (1 picture in a individual folders, in the main folder itself)."

      "Probably be easier on a laptop, as had some trouble with words disappearing a few times after writing them on cards, went back and were gone. Also changed the date and everytime I went to check, it reverted back to wrong date. Will update when I receive my order.",
      "Always a catch! The service and ease of use is great. There are some creative designs to bring personal photos to life. However, shipping is about $10 per item so nothing is cheap regardless of the promo.",
      "Stops working all the time, is the opposite of user friendly when it isn't force closing. Only reason I keep it is for the free book a month which I'm not sure is even worth the stress of trying to make it!",
      "Love this app! Great deals and specials. only wish there were more mobile editing options. To add background and color I have to be on my computer :( Other than that no issues",
      "I havn't been disapointed with anything from this printing company. I even like when getting wallet prints they send a page that has all the prints on it. Its great for locket pictures."

      "Awesome, I've had zero issues because I can read pretty well and all of the features/drawbacks are pretty well explained and fairly obvious. Haven't lost any photos and the cloud service has brought me through multiple phones. Would definitely recommend. I've had the premium sube for a few years now. $25 a year isn't much to support something you like.",
      "READ BEFORE YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!! Pictures I had saved, even from years ago on separate devices all got deleted. I know they synced because they had been saved for years most of them. There's nothing left now. Have spoken to Developers and Customer service. Told them the issue well over five times and have still been waiting hours for a response back. I suggest using a different app and boycotting this app before they lose all your pictures and play dumb afterwards.",
      "It never fails me but at times it clutters the files. When I access the individual files they don't follow the preview arrangement and others seem unnecessarily repeated! The database could be corrupting the arrangement or something like that. Otherwise, it's the best of it's kind. No competition.",
      "The app doesn't reveal any content in it as you open it and it hides all the saved pictures. Nothing is shown at all. Keeping on opening it and closing it back and forth for hours but didn't work. - EDIT - Just editted my review from 2 stars to 4 stars after the problem or the glitch resolved. I may not be too bitchy about it, just hoping not to lose my pics on this app.",
      "Do NOT download; boycot this app and any other app from this developer. They subscribe you to premium trial without your knowledge, when the trial period runs out, they hold your photos hostage in an effort to try to make you pay for the app. I had to delete an album with 3 photo that the app rendered inactive so I could not export them. The app gave me a pop-up telling to upgrade to premium else I will lose 4 fotos. I am NOT kidding you. Andmore frustration the app put you through try to expor"

      "Toolwiz Photos is more than amazing. I am a Pro when it comes to using this app. I have almost mastered all its features and to be honest, this is 1 of the 3 photo editing apps I rely upon for all my editings. I wish this app had 1 or 2 features that Google's snapseed has. If they could develop those features, I won't even need the Snapseed. I have a couple of more suggestions for the developers if they would listen. I can help them make this already best app even better. Waiting for a reply.",
      "I use this app a lot just lately and it is unusual for me as i am not very Artistic in any Shape or Form. Having said that it is very easy to Achieve what you are trying to do even for an amateur like myself. A Few weeks of having it and I've managed to edit some amazing Snaps the Tools are excellent and plenty are free to test of course you can add get more if you Purchase the Pro Version. I haven't actually taken Snapshots with the app but i use to alter my Snaps and 5* Deserved.",
      "I have been using toolwiz for years and have enjoyed everything it has to offer. I just noticed a couple days ago that all of the things ive saved for instance frames, stickers, text have all been deleted. I tried to save some of my favorite frames and it says saved but its all blank. Please let me know what i can do to fix this. It seems Im not the only one with this problem. I love toolwiz and would hate to uninstall due to all the problems I've been having. Thank you for your time.",
      "I use the emoji thing to put a tiny one in the bottom corner, like a logo, i have to shrink it down a bit. It used to work fine but for some reason it doesn't now, don't know why and i can't find another app that has the same symbol. The app is probably one of the best but i need that one thing to work.",
      "I have used this photo editor for a few years now and I loved it but I recently upgraded my device and when I go to download anything from the store the store has nothing but blank spaces where overlays, fonts, and stickers, Etc. used to be. Please fix . I would love to change my rating back to 5 stars. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus running the latest version of Android and it is GSM unlocked. Thank you."

      "I am not sure if this is an Android-related problem, but it seems that videos exceeding an hour of length won't play. In fact, the moment I scroll passed the folder where this certain video is stored, the app will immediately close, and this made me temporarily change to my device's default gallery app. Other than that, it has a really nice design, but it definitely lacks many features present in Google Photos — I hope all of this gets fixed.",
      "I like this app, simple to use, simple and user friendly design, NO ADS (which is hard to find for a gallery app), the NEARLY perfect Gallery App! One feature that is missing is the ability to sort the folders/albums by their name. The default/only option currently has the most recently added to album appear first after the camera roll folder. Google keeps giving lip service (since December '19) that this feature is being added in the very near future, but four months later it still isn't there.",
      "Video player moves faster at the beginning of a video. It's so annoying. Pls fix the issue and add more controls like volume and brightness, or provide an option to open a video file with other installed video players",
      "Stop forcing dark mode. Not everyone likes dark mode. Give users the option to switch to light theme irrespective of device's dark mode being on/off. And also provide an option to turn off grouping pictures. Most of the auto grouped pictures are irrelevant.",

      "super easy to use and delivery was on time and very good quality, exactly what I wanted! I'm super happy with the way the images turned out and I've already put them up on my wall, usually I dont rate apps but I was recommended this app by a friend so I would love to pay that forward by letting you know that the first 10 prints are completely free and 100 percent worth it!!",
      "Totally loved this app! So far, I have used it more than twice and this app has given me lots of free printed photos in good quality. And when I went over with the free prints limit, the extra cost is very affordable and the quality of the photos are just amazing!...way cheaper than WalMart or Costco that is! So Happy Me! 👏😍👍 Thank You FreePtints!🤩👍",
      "I downloaded this app without high expectations, but man was I pleasantly surprised. I ordered 108 photos and paid less than 15 dollars to have them show up at my door within 5 days. They arrived in excellent condition. Amazing quality photos I wouldn't have otherwise printed due to high prices. So glad I found this app. Highly recommend.",
      "I chose my free prints and some, altogether 98 pics. In the process of checking out for only $2 more I had the option to choose a box of my choice for my prints.Total w/S&H incl price was only $14.85. I was amazed w/the quality and that I received everything in just days. Thank U to FreePrints bc these were photos that I've wanted for a long time! Very pleased w/my experience w/this app. If u cherish ur pics I recommend u use this app before u lose any pics! Also check out PhotoBooks.100%👍🙋",
      "Update: I signed out and logged in again and the issue was as simple as that to fix! I had to pick all my photos over but small inconvenience for the amazing photos I get!! Used to be the best app for my pics but lately picture clear pictures on my phone are coming out blurry through the app and therefore printing blurry. Very disappointed and hope this issue gets fixed and soon. I was able to sign in through my fiances email but I had to start all over picking my photos."

      "It was very simple to use. Although having better options such as changing my photos to fit the frames and easy way to select from the sd card if needed would be great.

      "Very nice app , despite the fact that Im not the most brightest if it's comes to technology, I managed to make a quiet nice piece of art from my gallery...love it!",
      "I absolutely love this app!! \"PhotoMania\" has so many ways to utilize textures, apply colors, and create dimension with lines and space!! I sat down with this app... and literally entered another world. When I finally realized how long had passed, I could hardly believe the clock was right... It had been just shy of 2 and 1\\2 hrs!! A very enjoyable experience!! Definitely a 👍👍 two thumbs up.... Thank you PhotoMania developers!!",
      "I have played with plenty of photo apps. There are many different ones to choose from, but you can also have bad experiences as well. Photo Mania is the best photo app I have found yet! Free, access to all my photos, no ads to pop up out of nowhere, and the cutest frames and decorative patterns to make sure you love your pic even more than before! I am thrilled with the fun, and beautiful masterpieces I have been creating. I look forward to making many, many more!",
      "Good for filters/screens -but thats about it. No basic tools like cut/crop or basic rgb color adjust- etc-no brushes or focus-no way to align a photo with the pre-cut frames-filters have no adjustments as far as intensity so basically a die cut take it our way or leave it. So you basically could use it as a jumping off point but still need another photo editing app-wish developer would have spent the time making the other half & it could've been a goodgo-to/all in one."

      "Hello. I recently bought a Huawei tablet for my lr mobile edits. However the interface is different and how the tools are laid out were a pain to deal with. It seems to push the picture away ang then takes up about 70% of the screen. Is there a way to get the interface like what I get in the phone? 1 star for attention. Will bring it back to 5 if I get a decent reply.",
      "I LOVE Lightroom on the desktop, BUT I just HATE how this particular lr app crashes so often when im using it. It crashes every minute I swear. I will loose progress most of the time on what i was working on. Sometimes it doesn't even save my work when I try to save it. I would give this app ZERO stars of I could. It's so frustrating and takes 50x longer to edit photos than on the desktop version. If this gets fixed I'll change my review, but honestly this sucks.",
      "This is a hreat photo editing app bit the only problem is that the main tools which are essential for a photo edit are only available in the premium version of it. And that too is very expensive. And hence I feel that snapseed is way more better than this.",
      "App is fantastic but its taking too much time in exporting images sometimes it took half an hour to export the image and most of the time the app quits automatically while exporting the pic . Even after updating the app and I've reinstalled the app the situation is same as before.",
      "Probably my most used app. It has nearly all the features that my desktop Lightroom has, but in my pocket. It's fantastic. However, I say nearly, because you have to pay separately for the mobile editions, even if you have a subscription for the desktop software."

After a few days all my data from this app in my new phone was not visible and app was completely new. I have lost all my data. Can someone please help me how to recover it back.",
      "Do not buy or use this free app. a bunch of my pictures are missing. Hundreds going back for most of 2019 actually. I just downloaded this a week ago and realized after moving 25 pics to it that now my camera folder in Google photos is missing hundreds or thousands of photos. I even paid for the or version. Disgusted.",
      "pictures are automatically shuffled, so to speak, when you import more than one at a time. this does not work well for me when i have a gallery of 150 images i need to keep in exact order. albums are impossible to delete also. i hope these oversights are fixed soon as this is actually the best vault app i can find",
      "Great app security wise, but there are three main frustrating parts to this; 1. Sometimes it doesn't load in media correctly or can't load it at all 2. Some pictures can't be zoomed in at all 3. Sometimes video playback closes after a few seconds",
      "Do not waste money on the pro version, it does not work. The ios version works well, but wireless sync option doesn't work with the Android version (Android 10), you drag files over and they refuse to be uploaded."

It would be nice to be able to adjust the amount of zoom on a slider like the speed of the animation from slow to fast. This is my only complaint, I leave the display effect on crop to fit almost all the time because the zoom is just too much. Otherwise I think it is a great app.",
      "Great app. Have been using it on my old tablet loading data from my home server. Just 2 points I hope it can be improved upon. 1. Display of location info to include the country. 2. The randomized showing of the photos doesn't seem random enough. Updated on 20-Jan-2020 in response to the developer's reply. First, thank you for the response. 1. Country info is not available under abbreviated address option. Under full address option, there is no spacing between the words. Some of the addresses are too long and is rather distracting. The abbreviated mode with country info would be the way to go. 2. I am already using Shuffle option. I have more than 10 thousands photos in multiple folders, and I do see repeated photos being displayed."

      "What happened?? All of a sudden the free add ons to download aren't working. The frames, other filters, etc. They aren't downloaded anymore and when I try to redownload them, it keeps saying error occured price: null. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but that didn't help or fix the problem. I love this app for editing, but some times I just want to use a frame or filters, and I can't now. I also tried to sign back in to my Adobe account but that's not working either.",
      "This app does a good job of editing photos, but its lacking in the most basic of areas. Getting a photo into the editor should be the MOST basic of functions, but unless you want to shoot a photo, getting one from an album is difficult. Why not just have a menu where you can browse photos you want to edit? None exists.",
      "I used to use this app to edit my cake photos for work. When I updated the app the option to make a collage is now a separate app. Why would I download 2 apps to do what 1 used to be able to do. Waste of space. I had to delete it.",
      "Doesn't open properly and freezes up. Very frustrating because when it happens to work, I like it.",

      "It does what is says it's a photo gallery, the reason why I am giving 2 stars is because there is way TOO MANY ads ! When ever you go to do something a ad pops up, edit a photo a ad pops up, make a folder as pops up and move or delete a ad pops up. I understand it's a free app with ads for promotions, but when you can't even finish something because of the ads it's a little to much. Hope you fix it soon or I will be deleting",
      "Was working great but since they change the app and added quotes etc the Video status doesn't work sfter s few weeks but they keep sending video updates. I emailed the creator but no response. The quotes still work and the gallery. Jan 15 still have gotten a reply to my emails etc and video status does not work but still getting new videos to download.",
      "Almost every action within the gallery will give you an ad - almost every action, even backing out and closing. I know most of these apps can not be ad free but at least make them less obtrusive instead of the entire phone screen. A banner scrolling on the bottom would be nice. Unacceptable.",
      "Doesn't show any pictures, only ads. I have no Gallery for my phone, AT&T couldn't help because i asked google and google didnt know what to do either. My Samsung S10e didnt come with a gallery. So AT&T guy tried this app and it doesnt work. I dont know if its just my phone but didnt work for me."

      "Obviously there are idiots complaining about 'glare' issues, for one don't use your flash, two find the right lighting (as old glossy photos have a tendency to reflect light) and three, this App is absolutely great if you know how to use it. P.s the resolution is fine, maybe it's time to upgrade your phone.",
      "The resolution of the resulting scan is quite a bit lower than a regular image taken with the phone camera, resulting in sometimes unreadable text, making the app basically useless. I like the concept of merging 4 pics to remove glare (works partially) and getting a straighter image, but with the low resolution it's not useful.",
      "I have scanned over 600 family photos mostly from the early 1900's and before. It works well once I figured out the optimum placement of the photo and light settings. I am still getting some with glare but I can usually scan a second time and avoid it.",
      "PhotoScan absolutely delivers as promised. Picture perfect and glare free enhanced digital scans of all your printed photos via your phones camera. Excellent approach/method to securely back up all printed photos (hard copy). The automatic cropping based on edge detection is executed with precision and care. However, smart rotation keeps your photos right-side-up, no matter which way you scan them. Overall, all printed photos captured via PhotoScan are safely backed up via Google Photos.",
      "For documents and situations where resolution is not important, this app works great. However, resolution is bad. This app should use the combined photos to create an image that is higher resolution and higher quality than is possible with the normal camera app. Instead, the resolution is low and there are unacceptable artifacts visible when zooming in."

      "I love this camera and editor. The filters are wonderful and the variety is sweet. Even the free version has a ton of content to it, and my main criticism would actually be the per month subscribe thing being the ONLY option ,5 big ones each and every month. Now I'm all about supporting g the dev's and these guys do deserve to make money this is a great product, but I'd love an option to buy outright. Other then that takes amazing pictures, cool editing options I love love love it!",
      "Creativity at it's best! This is the first ap I've used like this after getting creative with photos through portraying images. I'm still experimenting but I find the cartoon one awesome and sometimes it turns into a whole different imagine but I can keep the image if I like it or delete it, all the while keeping my original photo in tact. Had been wishing for this for quite awhile. Fascinating results.",
      "This is too much money! I love the creativity in this and I get that they need money! But when I try to use some tools,EVERYTHING COSTS MONEY! I don't have lots of money so this is not the app for me! Everything here is 12.99$ I would not recommend this app to anyone with only a little bit of money!😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧",
      "It is a fun app and I photograph my sister and she poses and the cartoon is so cool it really is awsome. So I recommend you get it but I'm not sure if it has adds I really like it and it's fun.",
      "You should change the name....its literally just a normal phone camera with filters you can get using the built in camera on most phones or candy camera which are all free.....UTTERLY POINTLESS IN PAYING FOR YOUR APP (ya i know you want to make money and stuff but im just being completely honest)"

      "I am definitely blown away by Fotor Photo Editor App. It is my pick out of any of the many photo apps I have ever used before. I will be using this app for all my serious photo editing forward on. Thanks for making this app not only crammed full of groovy editing features, it is so simple to use. The number of cool effects, frames, stickers, etc to choose from is unbelieveable and are available for free upon installation. I couldn't imagine needing any other app to use.",
      "I've been using this app for a few years. I have quite a few photo editing apps on my phone - each serving its own purpose. Fotor is great for pixelating photos which some of my other apps don't have.",
      "Amazing light app... Not only is it an excellent photo editor, but also a great tool for artists. Thanks! All I can add is that I'm happy with this app, and I constantly use it as part of the set of tools that help me achieve what I look for when doing my art work.",
      "For several days I've been trying to see the MISSIONS and HOTSEAT. But all the time it's displaying \"Network error, please try again later\". Even worse the app has been frequently crashing while I'm browsing the various editing options. I used to love this app, and have used it for editing quite often. But now I should give a second thought.",
      "Updated to verify I was able to restore my previous purchases. Still my prefered editing app, however I would love a blur wand tool to be added in future as I currently have to edit in fotor then move to another app to blur or do any small direct editing."

      "The ads just to see you're own photos are ridiculous. The organization is all messy and photos are out of order. Having some customization would be nice since they don't seem to organize it themselves very well.",
      "Pictures won't rotate. If you save a picture or capture one it won't appear in the gallery for quite some time unless you restart the phone. It asked me umpteen times to rate it so here ya go",
      "Ads are a complete waste of my time. The ads with audio are completely unnecessary as they seem to happen when I'm trying to show a customer evidence of what I find with their equipment. Also, I recently updated to Android 10. Immediately after the update some of the thumbnails are grayed out. Those pictures are inaccessible. About half of the thumbnails that can be seen come up as a black screen when tapped to see the larger picture. This is unacceptable 😡"

      "I really like this App,I'm not exactly what you would call tech savy, but this App is making me look like I know what I'm doing alittle. I do alot of Reviews for different companies, for their products that they give me.Now I can attach some better looking pics. For Free! And if you want to you can add stuff for a few $$ a month, but you get alot for free. I dont mind looking at a ad or video once in a while, its not that bad. You get quite a bit too. Thanks!",
      "The main reason for rating this app 3 stars is as mentioned :- The app is nice, excellent but the problem is it asks for money when it comes to the backgrounds or stickers. So I wish that it could improve through it. And I could even wish for more border option such as decorative balls and else. Rest the app was good",
      "I really like this app. I'm able to create different types of backgrounds for my phone and a lot of fun things. It's really fun to just mess around on it and find different things to create on there. My only problem would be the extra backgrounds. You have to sign for Photo Pro. I haven't really looked into it but I think you might have to pay for it. Other than that I really recommend this app!!!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "Easy and Fun! I am using it to put together photos as my daughter progresses through her pregnancy. Really neat tool to do that. I could even flip a picture where she faced the wrong way. There are a lot of options and tools within the app.",
      "Love. I couldn't believe how much more there is in this app. You think it's just college. Definitely add that in your write up of the app. Bonus is they all work great it's user friendly and your not paying a arm and leg to use other features."

      "I can't say enough good about this app. You could spend hours and hours having a ball making hilarious edits on your pictures to enhancing ones you don't want to be comical. I've checked out a few apps and it's hard to know which one to pick as well as getting past any negative reviews. I thought I'd take a leap and download this one just to see if I could do it. I was glad I chose this one after making one creation that was not only fun but amazed at all the things it does. Highly recommend it",
      "A curate's egg. Good in parts. Pros: no ads; doesn't run at startup. When it recolours/new brushstrokes, it does it well. Cons: no instructions; no variables on effects (i.e. only full on or full off); Artist styles don't work at all (Anime, Dali etc.); too many features blocked.",
      "I'm thinking more artists could use this app as a jump off start for mainipulating their base drawings without all the hassle of extra work. I haven't uploaded anything to Photoshop yet, so that will be my second rating coming up. But it could certainly save allot of time in the design of a project.",
      "I love this application,it shows the beauty of every picture,it is essential for everyone who likes to discover the hidden points of charm that cannot be seen easily,I don't want to give it 5 🌟 I want to give 6 stars,it is a great miracle to everyone...love it💗",
      "I loved the app. Only con I experienced so far is some effects do no apply after being selected and an error message is displayed."

      "Would buy the full app. But it still needs lots of improvments, for example the selective bruch tool is ver nice. But the effects should be saved one by one. So if i play with the tones i should save and brush again to change the hue or the light.. also in the main adjustment the selective point dosnt work free on the mask. So only lens linear and so on.. but there is potential. I will buy after repairs .congrats team!!",
      "I LOVE this app. There are so many great brushes and options to transform your pics! From perspective views to light editing- and best of all tutorial videos on most (or all?) of the different options. ~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~• I have a request. On the doodle option, it would be great if there was an eraser for your doodles. When drawing something on my pic, sometimes I see something I need to correct and The undo isn't the right choice every time unless I want to redraw everything.",
      "I have had this app since it was first released and i swear i paid a one off payment for the full app on its release, and it became one of favorites for my photos, i havent used it for quite a while so was absolutely overjoyed when i came to use it again only to find a subscription service and now its overun with advertising. Time to remove this app i think. And find something that when you actually pay for premium that it stays premium not a update to add a subscription.",
      "Super cool easy to use. I love it and the price for pro lightX (which allows you to do more with the photos), is at a really affordable price. Even when u don't pay for the pro version ur not bombarded with advertisements witch is very rare these days with downloading applications. I'm very happy I downloaded it. And will be recommending this app to my friends.",
      "Very impressive editing application! Lots of free features, although like other apps the best are saved for the paid pro option. LightX is very affordable if you choose to pay and they offer multiple price points so you can save if you know your going to use for months at a time rather than only paying for it month after month."

      "I use several editing applications and Fotogenic is one of my top 2. And the two offer entirely different types of features(I.E. animation). Easy to use! Fun! Offers basic editing to more finite, professional options! I have is to create a back button that doesn't take you all the way back to the your start. But goes back within that feature specifically. Thank you for a phenomenal application!",
      "It is the ultimate photo editor if you can upgrade to the pro version and unlock all the features. If not, it is still okay, a little better than most other editors. It will allow you to try a pro feature if you rate it a 5. I only noticed one feature that was for. There should be more pro features allowed to be unlocked as rewards for veiwing entire ads, giving ratings, sharing the app, inviting friends to download and try the app, and posting on social media.",
      "I probably use this app the most. I love the various menus, and especially how they are broken down for easy recognition (and some of those are broken down as well). Plus, there is a \"quick\" menu to access recently used actions. I am also very grateful that they offer so many actions with this app without having to buy the \"pro.\" Took me a little while to get used to it, but I'm glad I kept using it. I have 4 editor apps, but this is the one I would give up last! Great job, Fotogenic!",
      "Stop. I'm not a paid reviewer and my German sir name is evidence of that lol. In the simplest way possible, this is the only editing program you need. It doesn't eat up all of your devices ram like others do and by default the original is left as well.i use three programs and this one is the only one I felt like paying for because this program has the best set of filters, period, Lol LADIES listen. If this one doesn't have the filter you need then it doesn't exist.",
      "Great App a must have to have the best photo possible ,for those who post negative reviews know little about apps like these if I could give it 10 STARS I would. This app is the total package app from head to toe to defining muscles ,it in my opinion is the king of all photo editors out there so if your looking for perfection this app will satisfy .Trust me I have used hundreds of apps that don't have half the features or quality.**************************************************************STAR"

There are hundreds to choose from and amazing text effects are also available here.",
      "Absolutely my favorite app just for the retro template, it's hilarious. Needs some more options for customization like text rotation and maybe introduce a user made system where you can use others templates just some suggestions",
      "I love it but I wish it just had more stuff to do and when you take a picture I wish it naturally blended in so it looked real that would be cool because you know lighting is everything if you don't have perfect lighting it won't match with the picture you know what I mean it sad ☹️"

I always edit my prints as if I am going to send them out to print. Then I find the resolution is to low??? Then I have to edit the image all over again!!!",

Quality is very good and you can make any pic look wayy cooler than it already is and you could edit a very cool pic in like a minute and a half. So yeah i recomend it to people who absolutle love editing pics and you want a cool high qualty. Byeeee",
      "The best photo editing app I've seen or used so far - with features many others lack, such as an actual draw tool (why isn't that function more popular?) meme maker etc. If you're looking for a good, all-around editor for your portable device, I couldn't recommend this one more.",
      "I just read on a review that this app had frames & filters but they're now gone? I live on a fixed income and I love my free apps! Aviary is free and I used it a lot but now it can't even be updated!? It had frames, filters, editing tools & more. Now it's practically obsolete. I have Aviary saved on my SD card, but it's useless. Can't update the frames, filters, etc. Basically it's only a cropping app with bold texting (unable to download any add'l fonts) & capable of drawing on the photo! 👎",

I would give this app 5 stars but it has ALOT of ads. If they had very little ads,then this would be a 5 star rating. And if this doesn't work for people, then it's their phone not the APP!!!! keep up the good work but please REMOVE THE ADS FOR FREE!!!!! thank you so much tho for providing this!!",

      "I mean, I love this app but I hate how my hub constantly freezes upon load up and how it takes over 10min for it find new pictures in my gallery. I have to uninstall and reinstall frequently.

As an amateur photographer, I still prefer using (& paying for) the online ViewBug website, but this app has made improvements on adding & saving profiles, it's a quicker & easier way to upload your photos, especially if you are taking them using your mobile phone. It does what it claims to do, & does it well :)",

It took me 2 days to upload a photo as it kept freezing when trying to upload. Needless to say I wont be bothering to post any more photos on here.",

      "I think the game is fun but I wished you can choose a folder you have in your photos instead of them being random from your entire phone. You could have a great set of photos that are funny to use and can hint towards you but then you have 2 that stick out like a sore thumb that kind of ruins the fun for the rest.",
      "Exellent game. Very fun to play with friends. And the developers are answering very quickly to a question or a problem.",
      "The app itself is a fun game, but it doesn't work on my hlpjone anymore, it doesn't even load and so I can't actually play with friends or at all - if you could fix this bug I would love it, thanks. :)",
      "Hi. This is a great game, but it has some bugs on the OnePlus 6. It takes a very long time to load everything on the OnePlus 6 when you host a game. Especially when playing video roulette",
      "It's a fun app but please give us power to adjust the game length and the time people are able to vote on a person."

      "Good app. I've always took my phone into a store and download pics into a photo computer. Snapfish was deffinatley less expensive. I gave it 4 stars because it seems like the more i edit my pictures the slower the app would go and eventually the app would stop responding and shut off and all of my progress would get lost, but that was my only problem, so not bad",
      "You have competition! Snapfish has a better deal on mobile device print orders. The quality of the delivery and photos are better. I been complaining about the device upload of pics from my device to the app. The pixel is off and i was told by my tmobile service provider that snapfish must update the app for my android to be adaptable. I dont order my pics from my mobile device from snapfish for this reason. Plus you offer only 100 prints per month for free. Shutterfly is unlimited.",
      "The moving of pictures from place to place was very difficult and I ended up just using the \"organize by date\". And using a coupon was difficult because I had not written down the code before I began so I had to go back and begin again.",
      "I was completely unable to work out how to order the free prints I was offered by Snapfish if I downloaded the app! I ended up paying the full price as it was not at all apparent how to claim the free prints!"

      "It's been great so far! I love that you can unlock some things just by watching an ad and I don't mind that. Wish there were some more pics to choose from but I have plenty of my own I can use so it's not really a problem.",
      "So far a GREAT APP, easy to use and I love the multiple text box option. There are also a variety of fonts as well. The only suggestions I would make, are to have guiding lines to know when something is level and/or centered. Also, some indication that different text boxes are the same size would be great! Lastly, a more diverse photo gallery would be appreciated as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
      "The free option is fine enough. I like the templates already available, and numerous options to self create as well.",
      "I had an exceptionally pleasant experience using this app. I have to make myself put the phone down now. But I'll rest assured knowing my project is so much closer to finised because this app made it possible. I appreciate the creator's consideration and hard work. Thank you !!! I love the option to unlock premium features just by watching quick videos. 👍 Neat!! No doubt 5 stars in my opinion ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🌪 and a tornado...",
      "Can't change the font size, I find it a big issue as resizing is needed all the time."

      "Yes truly great app developed under Google. In comparison with PicsArt sum feuters are missing. Ya like draw and sum stickers and like other sum feuters. I hope you add this feuters in fucture 🤗 , also there are many feuters are available that are not in PicsArt. Thumbs up for that 👍. I like the simple ui and Dark theme of this app 👌. But as Google's perspective you can make more minimalistic and simple UI. I like your work very well. Keep creating 😉",
      "The most flexible and user friendly advanced photo editor out on android. It is always so much fun to use the app. I don't want to go anywhere below 5 stars with my rating but I really wish the 'Expand' tool is more flexible and mainly if it didn't cut down the quality so much (atleast when using black or white expand instead of smart). That would be amazing."

      "I wrote to their customer service email the following: I haven't been using BeFunky on my phone, because it seems as though even though I upgraded my account on my desktop, that upgrade doesn't trade over to my smartphone account under the same login. Is that true? If so, please immediately cancel my account on both devices. That seems utterly unfair. Thank you,... I not only heard nothing back, but my account has still been billed, and that email eventually bounced back. 🙄",

I'm super excited I found this app & will enjoy the books for years to come. Put together a book of our family vacation & ordered 3 books: one for each of us to cherish. I have recommend this app to several of my friends. Love the choice of covers, background color, shape frames and page layouts.",
      "I love this app. I have made so many of these books as gifts to remind us of people we love that have passed away, wonderful events, and graduations. And its a great deal. I recently made 1 and made 5 copies and another one and it was free! They made tiles too. Separate app tho.",
      "I loved this app, personally I feel like the shipping is very reasonable . I do feel for new users instead of a hardcover feature they shouild just get free shipping, I feel like it will allow the buyer to see there first product and help them decide to purchase again. Besides for that 10/10 best photo book app out there.",
      "I love the pictures and the books. You're warned before you order if the picture might not be clear if you try to enlarge it to much for the pixels. The price is great! I enjoy being able to physically hold the pictures and look through them. Great app!",
      "I'm so happy that I found this app!It makes putting together a photo book easy and fun.There are also a lot of different options,and pricing is very reasonable.I will continue to use this app for a very long time, I love it"

      "Having a terrible time with app. Been communicating with help via chat they have weird hours. Only some small help after having initially working ok using edge browser they suggested chrome. That help for a bit. App and web portal constantly locking up. Wish I could get to ALL the photos I scanned. And then a refund so I can go try a different app or buy a scanner",
      "Terrible app. Must pay a subscription for the app to auto crop and rotate images poorly. I tried several times and each time came out worse than if I took a picture and cropped it myself. Waste of time.",
      "I had trouble accessing my account and sent a message requesting assistance over the weekend. Working with a technical support person, we had the problem solved by 7:30 a.m. the next day!",
      "So easy and fast to use! Very helpful support line when needed.",

We had a funeral for my sister in law and all we had to do was take a picture of all the photos in old photo albums and it cropped and saved all the photos to an album on the app, and I was also able to save them to my phone, as well as send a link to emails to create a slideshow ❤️"

This app needs more hair styles, although some of the selections are out dated, you can easily edit the hair from your face. The curly lace wigs that are trending now, should be added that shows the edges. A beautician would find it useful if upgraded.",

      "Great app! Love how it can go to the internet and pull just about anything you can think of! Wish there was a library to show the abbreviations for what you can look up to take it to the next level. Example PNG is a clear overlay photo! So glad I discovered it in the pulldown bar and decided to just click on it to see what it was. Makes me wonder what else is out there waiting for me to discover and learn it. That's why I wash there was a library option to show the Newbies * :)",
      "Easy to use. Love the backgrounds and stickers. The combination are endless. It makes me want to new age scrap book! ALL OF MY PICS!!! My only complaint would be that You have to pay for a lot of stickers. It has come a very long way from when i first started using it a few years ago. It still is one of my favorites. It has lots of options to be creative. Can sasily share your photos on a lot of platforms. Keep up the good work.",
      "I really like this app! It is very helpful and usefull for gifts and for wallpapers. I also like how you can use images from google and that there is no adds. The only thing i dont understand is how expensive some of the stickers are. Some of them are £3. But i do think that it is a very good app, and what makes it even better is that most of the stuff is free. So i recomend this app with good high ratings.",
      "I think this app is really good,except for little glitches. I am an Android user, and these are SUPER laggy, but pic collage barely even lags. Why I love this app: there are no ads, and everything on here is amazing. I haven't paid for the premium edition, and I'm not planning to, but still. Awesome app and completely for kids. I myself am one, and I haven't seen any kind of inappropriate things, like other apps do (ads, content, etc.) But all in all, pic collage is a great app and 100% worth it",
      "Always perfect. I've been using this app for a couple years on a few galaxy phones. Always does exactly what I need it to do, never had a problem. I generally use it to make grids and love the ability to change the size and position of my pictures within the grid as well as the borders and stickers. I'll keep using until it gives me a reason not to."

      "3 for the regular version. Its good, very well laid out, great features and effects. But many are locked, which requires an annual subscription fee to unlock. Too high in my opinion. 1 for subscription version. A one time purchase price would make the paid version more attractive Average ra",
      "Just started using it today and it looks really great. Not too many ads so far and they don't interrupt my picture editing. I originally got the app to just make some minor tweaks to some photos I'll use for Roleplaying online and whatnot but I can see myself using it for more.",
      "Awesomeness, pure and simple... Great for Photo Art. Perfect your images. Then, blend and manipulate your ideas across your page... basically, you can create just about any image/scene you can envision. I often use it to make my Twitter profile and posts more appealing to the average",
      "Awesome! Im so glad I downloaded this app, I typically stay away from editing apps due to how buggy they are, but Photo Editor Pro works great! Loads quickly and isnt consumed by ads. Things are easy enough to figure out and theres tons of cool free features aside from the ones you gotta pay for"

I have so many cuts I don't want to lose by trying to uninstall and reinstall. If I end up having to I'll just download a different app. Other than that it works good for what I'm using it for.",
      "You ruined your own app...and now pay outlandishly for it? FAIL . Totally agree with Aaron Cargill; since the update, it has totally changed. Now it won't even work for free after watching ads. I've had it installed for a while now. Even paid for it a bit. Now it's DELETE TIME. 😕 Realistically, you should know Your own app well enough to understand Aaron Cargill and the others' comments on the issues with this app. Needs some tweaking. ... 7.99 weekly? It'll never happen. That's greedy. 👎🏻",
      "I've used this app for years and it's been incredible. The last photo I made added a watermark and told me that if I wanted to get rid of it I had to pay for premium. What a huge letdown. I mean there has always been ads which is fine. No big deal. Ya gotta make your money and I get that. But this is a 1 star and uninstall for me after this.",
      "If you love popup ads, this is the app for you. There is a popup ad after every single keystroke!! Beyond that, the app does not easily do what it claims to do. Complete waste of time",
      "It is a good aap so many options to edit a photo or you can also add background or you can also join to photo but their is a problem of this aap thay show so many aad when you open it you shaw a aad when you edit a photo then again show the aad this cause I give him 4 star 1 star Cut for aad but the aap is best editing aap you can change so many background or edit so many photos"

      "Splendid. An app just for sharing photographs with other serious photographers. I love it!! The first time I used 500px was about a year ago and apart from a small break in-between I've always loved it. If you are a serious photographer and love sharing your photos with serious photographers I'd recommend it.",
      "Fantastic! It's the \"professional\" social media choice for what concerns photography. It features some really talented artists, spectacular images and offers so much! A must if you are a professional photographer. I'd like to see a little more criticism in the comment, in order to let a \"newbie\" photographer grow, instead of just commenting \"fantastic work\" in the hope of a \"follow back\". A \"critique\" section, visible only to the photograp owner for each photo, would be amazingly helpful!",
      "I used to prefer 500px over all other photo sharing sites. The app works like it is supposed to with professional level photographers sharing amazing work. Also received awesome feed back from other photographers, and I enjoy the quest. However, I can't give this app more stars because there has been a recent increase in spam accounts and 500px doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. This isn't Instagram, I paid for this service and now I'm seeing soam accounts promoting porn sites.",
      "My photos aren't getting sufficient pulse, views and likes. I am getting a feeling that my account has been programmed so that after reaching a certain pulse level or certain number of lines, my photos are not getting more viewership. This may sound native or stupid but I have observed this trend in my photos. Also if I like others photos, the pulse of my photos stops increasing gradually.",
      "I upgraded to an Awesome account on 500px after I had enjoyed browsing photography on the site. It took me a while to get round to attempting to upload any images of my own. When I did attempt to upload images I found that the upload functionality is so unreliable that attempting to upload more than 3 images at once almost always results in some images failing to upload. In one instance attempting to upload 20 images in one go resulted in 17 failures. It took me around 1 hour to upload 70 images. Uploading images should be straight forward and easy - it's a breeze with Flickr. After uploading my images I realised that reordering he images in a gallery does not work. Some images simply refuse to be reordered by dragging and dropping - the only available mechanism - no matter how many times this is attempted. I raised these issues with 500px support. They state they will respond within 2 days but after 4 days still no response. I then looked into Flickr instead and the user experience is far better - so much better that a comparison is meaningless. It would be like comparing eating excrement to a fine dining experience. I decided to ask for my money back. At this point it had been 32 days since I upgraded my account as it had taken me a while to get round to using it. I received just a short response saying that I was over the 30 day grace period with absolutely no mentioned of the issues which I had been experiencing. Clearly they do not care about the quality of the product they are offering and the customer service. Avoid at all costs."

      "The editing portion of VSCO is good, one thing I wish it had though was an image inverter. The new update also has me frustrated, it deletes the images from VSCO when you delete them from your phone, so if you wanted to keep the images on VSCO to see a layout of your Instagram feed like I do, you have to keep the images you've already edited saved to your pictures on your phone so they don't disappear. If you have limited storage on your phone, this can be a nuisance.",
      "I have been using vsco for probably over 7 years now, and I HATE the newest update. I really don't l how long winded it is just to save your edits /changes, especially when you're just editing and not sharing it/ posting it anywhere, there's so many extra steps and it slows it down and I feel like it takes ages to even save the changes to your edits. It's not as user friendly, too many steps to sharing and posting as well, it needs to be quicker! Go back to the old way of saving + posting please",
      "It was a great app, until it got an actualization, deleted ALL mi edits and now you have to buy it to be able to do ANYTHING. I can't copy edits to another pocture anymore, and I can't get back my, probably, 100 pictures that the app decided to delete just like that. Besides, it's causing technical issues with my phone. I was waiting to the next month to buy the subscription since I've been using this app for a long time, but now definitely won't.",
      "Never had any problems with the app until now, can barely even open it, or loads forever or the screen goes black. After restarting several times the app is painfully slow to use, can't scroll through my pictures without having to wait because it's so laggy. Also the new syncing with gallery feature is garbage and judging from other reviews it doesn't seem like I'm the only user to think that so maybe listen to all these people telling you it's made the app worse.",
      "I have been using this app for More than 5 years,it was the best app for editing photos. But after last update I couldn't save edited photos,every time I tried it the app crashes shut itself down. I uninstalled it and downloaded it again but it's even worse,now I even can't edit photos, whenever I open it, it shuts down. Please fix it or tell me what to do."

      "Downloaded to my kindle fire and by taking pictures with kindle fire from my pc I was able to import them into Prisma. A little complicated but it worked. If anyone has any ideas on how to simplify I would love to hear it. I love all the effects I can get on my photos for painting references.",
      "2020---------------- I purchased full version 1y=$18., however after color correcting I can't find retouched file anywhere. No Prisma folder appears on external memory nor on phone using on Android 8.1 The original file is kept, need feed back, instructions please, thx. -------------------------2019 Wha an excelent tool to create interesting and unusual photos, reminds me of \"Kais Power Tools\" Some filters/technique are great others not so effective but it allows for lots of creativity.",
      "This app used to be fun, but now it constantly asks you to pay (an inflated fee) for most features and several filters. Other apps do what this app used to do, and more, without all the extra BS.",
      "These filters are fantastic. The only possible negative is there are so many cool filters it's hard to pick just one on any given photo!",
      "Great app for everyone. My first conversion was from my photo of a flower bouquet to the mosaic style, which is just one of 500 options. It worked better than I could imagine. Also, Prisma has worked out the installation onto your phone. It all works so fast and easy and doesn't take up an enormous amount of space on your phone's memory like some of the others do. I highly recommend Prisma."

      "So far, quite good! Has several sliders for tweaking the final result, so you can change not only the intensity of the filter, but the hue, saturation, contrast, etc., as well. More than a dozen free filters, and at least as many more, that would unlock in the premium version. I prolly won't use the HD print option, but it's a nice feature!",
      "Purchased the pro version...Love the various filters and effects! Also love that \"you\" can adjust how much or little effect you want to create. Thank you Devs for addressing my previous issues, and your timely response...Happy with my purchase, and the freedom to create great photos!!!🤗",
      "Fun app! Free version seems fine, but pro is very reasonably priced. One star off because the filters aka effects could be easier to use. They aren't in any order and each filter uses a different base picture so it's hard to figure out what the results will be, unless you wait through the transformation of your selected image.",
      "Most photo paint apps are almost the same in the number and quality of filters. Deep Art Effects has more with much wider range of artistic effects. I think it is worth paying for it to get the locked filters. But the unlocked ones are a good start.",
      "Pros: Easy to use filters Most filters are free Excellent quality Can immediately go through some shutterfly like printing options for canvases, mugs, shirts, etc. Artists like Edvard Munch and George Seurat are cited as inspirations for their art movements. Cons: Some filters are locked Can't search or filter filters (lol) Some filters aren't named well ie: \"Impressionism 1\" was actually very Cubist and \"Cubism\" was not really Cubist at all. Some load times can be pretty long."

      "I'm honestly just really disappointed. This version of the app barely functions, and has less than half the features of its iOS counterpart. What gives?? I highly recommend the iOS version, but I wouldn't even give the android version a try unless you just want to be frustrated and feel shorted on features.",
      "I feel like Instagram should 110% be making 100,000xs more than the average okay store user. Therefore in order to use one of my favorite apps I think there should be a 100% free trial not just a 7-Day free trial the app should be free considering the incredible revenue this company brings in from Samsung and Apple iOS users.",
      "It seems to work well then every few months it decides not to upload photos to Instagram for a week even when I delete/reinstall the app, despite paying for the app. Disappointed.",
      "Yeah it's a really good app. Defo one of my go-tos that will stay on my phone. Only issue is the image quality for adding backgrounds is very low and pixelated."

      "I love this app! There are lots of fun things you can do with it, but I have 2 major issues with it... 1) you can't save ANY of your edited pictures (after the first couple of \"teaser/intro\" ones) without either watching an ad OR paying for the Pro version, and 2) the Pro version is WAY too damn much (min. $24 up to $100)! Otherwise, it's awesome!",
      "I've seen other people use Facetune2 and they have so many more features than I have access to. For example, other users are able to selectively increase color vibrancy on only some parts of the picture. I can't find that feature anywhere on the app. Another example is the \"restore\" tool in the reshape option. I don't have the restore tool but again, it would be really useful. I don't understand why this app is missing these tools.",
      "Used to love the original Facetune. Was a bit annoying that the second one came with purchases but there were enough free features for it to still be perfectly usable. However now you have to either purchase the pro version or watch an ad every time you want to save a picture. Put me completely off the app as a whole. I'll find something else that doesn't bombard me with ads thanks.",
      "Each update makes it worse. At first the patches were free, then they became premium, the app is becoming harder to use and is transitioning into a fully premium app. They just changed the tones to makeup which is extremely hard to use. It's hard to zoom in to get the nooks and crannies of a picture and it's difficult to get the same effects you were able to get before. This was the best editing app but now there's nothing on the market that lets me edit my photos the way I want to.",
      "I love this app BUT I am really annoyed because I got a new phone the other day which is an android. I was using this app for years on my iPhone and for the full VIP package I was paying £1.79 per month which was fine. I literally switch my phone and download the app on here and now the prices have gone up and to pay £1.99 a month you have to pay for the year and the whole lot upfront. How has that changed from just a day? I've emailed too and haven't heard anything back!"

      "liked it a lot at first. Very repetitive in a lot of ways. After you reach a certain level you're at the mercy of other people to advance. The voting system feels flawed, as after a while any photos you submit, regardless how good or bad, are removed or hidden to make room for others, which to me seems unbalanced as a potential winning picture will get tucked away while one submitted at the right time will get more votes and win.",
      "It was a very good site. I used to enjoy the challenges, share my images, see the work of different photographers, but since the last update Feb 6, 2020. the application is working very bad. Impossible to use. - On Feb 21, after a few another updates it's still the same. Slow, freezing, collapsing. Could you please fix it finally?",
      "I use gurushots everyday! as a photographer, it helps me think of things i would never take pictures of! the system is easy and ayone can \"play\". I am really happy I came across this app and I think if you really like picture taking to give it a try! I cant wait for the day I become a Guru!! If you wanna see my stuff look for Chloes Canon Captures! Thanks! 😊",
      "Finally!!! You got rid of the swipe method! See? I had given you guys a 1 star but now changed it back to 5! Another plus is the layout is great, I like that there's no clutter, thanks for bringing back the old voting system, now it's fun again playing gurushots.",
      "This is a great app and I really enjoy everything about it but the only reason I give this app 3 stars is that everytime I try to reset my password It goes straight to the sign in menu from the rest password link it sends to my email this is extremely annoying and a waste of time please fix this problem it would really make a difference"

Unlimited storage, no ads, and it’s free!\r\n\r\n3 Reasons to Start Your Album:\r\n\r\n1) You’ll love it\r\n\r\n- YOUR MEMORIES ON DISPLAY. Show off your photos and videos in a way that’s both beautiful and intuitive. Everything is automatically sorted by month, complete with your child’s age. Just swipe the screen to go back in time!\r\n\r\n- UNLIMITED STORAGE. Back up all your memories for free.\r\n\r\n- STREAMLINED SHARING. No more sharing the same photo with five different group chats. All your photos, all your videos, all your favorite people, all in one place.\r\n\r\n- YOUR PRIVACY IS OUR PRIORITY. Your album is completely private. All content you upload to the app belongs to you, and it can only be viewed by you and the family and friends you invite. That also means the app is ad-free and we don't share your data with advertisers. Read more at https://family-album.com/privacy.\r\n\r\n- COMPILATION VIDEOS. The app automatically pieces together 1-second clips of your memories into short, touching movies. Tissues not included!\r\n\r\n- PHOTOBOOKS. Get photobooks delivered to your doorstep. The app sends you suggestions every month—order as-is or create your own in minutes!\r\n\r\n- VISIBILITY CONTROLS. Decide what to show to the whole family and what to keep private between you and your partner.\r\n\r\n- IT’S ACTUALLY FREE. We make money two ways: (1) when you purchase a photobook or other product from the app and (2) when you register for our Premium service, which adds bonus features to our already-awesome free version.

      "Love this app! Had it set up ready to go while I was pregnant and now I upload whatever I want to share with just family, no clogging up their phone, they look at and save whatever pictures or videos they like. A perfect way to share intimately without publishing to the world on social media. Brownie points for: 1. Photos being automatically sorted chronologically 2. Remembering what you've uploaded and not showing them as options next time (no doubles caused by baby brain!)",
      "I adore this app! I downloaded it so I wouldn't have to remember to send all the pictures to a bunch of family members separately, but I quickly started using it to look through it myself. I love that the pictures are automatically sorted by date and that you can't accidentally upload the same image twice. This thing has become addictive already 🤣",
      "My family and I live over 700 miles from my sisters. I downloaded this app after my son was born to share photos. It has been AMAZING!!! It's very easy to use and organizes the photos nicely. While it has let my sisters stay connected with their nephew, it has also let me have a ready to go album to scroll through of my little boy! Highly recommend!",
      "My entire family has had this app since my son was born and it has been great! Everyone can upload their pictures and see/comment on all of the photos. The videos that are created for each month and year are amazing. I recommend this app to all families, especially with the arrival of a new baby!",
      "Honestly, I was a bit skeptical if this app would be helpful... My concerns were 1. if my family was actually going to use it and 2. was it going to be one more tedious thing I would have to keep up with. I am happy to say we have been using this app for 6 months and still love it! Both sets of grandparents (as well as aunts/uncles) still open the app often to check out new pics. And it actually lightened the load of texting pics to different people. Love this app!!!"

      "I absolutely love this app! The huge variety of different categories to transform your pictures w/is amazing. And all for free! Its beyond user friendly which I love. And it's so much more than xmas frames. All different holidays & special occasions. You can change lighting, background, do overlays, etc. If there are ads they are few and far between. I used this app to make my sisters xmas cards, my cards, and two friends their xmas cards. I plan on using this app much more often! Thank you!",
      "Fantastic app!!! It so much fun to use!!! Merry Christmas 🎄🎅🎁 to all!!! This is the best photo app ever!!! They also have other fun frames on here that are not Christmas. They have other holidays as well.",
      "Awesome App!!! Has loads of frames for any holiday or event. Also has animations, can change colors or lighting and also let's you personalize text. Best frame all I have ever had, & so easy!! Keep up the great work!",
      "I love this app! It turns your ordinary photos into pieces of art! I haven't found any flaws other than im a bit impatient waiting for the photos to finish! Lol",
      "The transfer of pics to frame is not that great. My pictures were shades and shades darker than the original. Not sure if it's because our skin's black. Heard of some AI or cameras that do this"
