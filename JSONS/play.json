      "Hello Development.. I am using this great program from the great Google company,And I think one of its advantages is keeping progress in games,And when entering compatible games, the game is registered in the profile,But the problem is that when I log in, nothing happens ,, I don’t know how to save progress or download a copy of saved data, to install my progress ,, the problem is that I don’t understand how it works ,, My device A10 Can you please reply as soon as possible?",
      "I have been using this app for 4+ years and it has (mostly) saved my progress on the games I have installed. Now in this recent update, ALL of my progress have been erased for more than 20+ games! An the worst part about it, it says I'm signed into all my apps, but when I try signing in to Play Games, it won't even show my progress at all. So if your planning on having an app that sometimes DELETES all of your 3+ years work of time of playing games, then I would recommend it to someone who is willing spend money to get your progress back after this app has been on for 45 minutes. Also BTW I deleted this after I made this review :)",
      "This is another one of those apps that you don't realy have another option some games won't even work if you don't have it instaled on your device. The part I don't like is that the only use for this app that I use it for is to save my game progress and show a record of my history except wene i looked at my history it was completly in accurate it didn't give credit for alot and gave me credit for things I don't think I did and wene a game looses connection it makes me sighn into google play agai",
      "The most recent update by Google for this app causes an error in several connected apps \"...requires one or more Google Play services that are not currently available.\" After reviewing several articles regarding the issue (none by Google), I found a solution - delete Play Services and Play Store cache and data to force connected apps to ask for account again. Google should fix this update that caused the issue in the first place.",
      "Everything \"Google Play\" is utterly useless. Like Amazon it is designed to push a massive number of search results, regardless of relevance, to drive sales instead of helping you actually find something relevant. I would spend a lot more money on games if I could only find games based on my interests. I want paid, if I'm paying then it can't have ads, no \"one and done\" stupid puzzle games and absolutely NO in app purchases. Barring that I buy a game about 1 in 50 internet searches."

      "I like the app but it is very annoying, when watcing certain movies, that the movie freezes from a couple seconds to almost a minute before continuing, also, when paused you almost always have to download the movie all over again. Can this be fixed by some kind of setting or so?",
      "There is ALWAYS an issue. Servers down all the time. Not much categories to choose (like sci-fi etc). They have thumbnails for movies they DONT have. When watching series there's no way to know where you left it. Lack of sorting options, would be nice to have a recently added tab. You can't go back if a video doesn't load, you have to cloade the app and start overIf they fix all that it could be a great app.",
      "This app is very useful but when I search up. A movie or something I want to watch I tells me : soon this will be on play and I wait and it never appears on play please fix that I like watching novels",
      "I'm tired of it freezing and then going freeze again and then going that needs to be fixed and everything is all in spanish can yall atleast put english subtitles or audio that would be great and I feel like yall lazy about fixing the lagg and I need to download other apps just so I can a movie I mean really :/"

      "I've used this app for years now and never saw a reason to bother with another one. But now I need to switch to another option. I use music on my phone to deal with sensory issues. Unfortunately, Google has decided to start sneaking Tracks It Thinks I Might Like (I think) on my playlists every here and there. At first, I could delete them and found an option to tell it to stop downloading them. But now, it streams them instead, and I can't just get rid of them with the 'delete' button anymore. This is extremely disrupting and, in areas of higher stress/sensory input, downright distressing. I need to switch to another music player because and only because I can't find an \"off setting\" for its new \"add random music you don't own to your Playing Now\" habit. If they decide to fix this and I find out that they fixed it, I really wouldn't mind going back to it. But for now, it's a no-go for me.",
      "Has a lot of problems really. It crashes, it always restarts the songs everytime I play them. I can't find most of the artists I listen. I mean Bethel Music is a really popular group but they don't have most of their content. Scrolling problem, not enough distance between the 3 dots and the scroll line. I'm really dissatisfied. Please fix it.",
      "Can you please fix the scroll problem? There is very little space between the scroll bar and the three dots symbol for each song. This is incredibly frustrating when you are trying to add multiple songs to a playlist. If you tap a couple of millimeters to the right, the scroll button gets activated and takes you to a random portion of the song list. I can't believe Google hasn't fixed this yet.",
      "Weird beeping has started to play every time a button is pressed or the song auto plays to the next in a play list SO ANNOYING, can't seem to find a fix for this. It is random, sometimes it's there and other times it doesn't do it. Have sent feedback from the app but that goes no where. I'm going to download all my songs and use the dafault Samsung music app.",
      "Best music player before I began to use a samsung. Even now, play music is yet one of the top music apps; if not among the top 3. However, we can add the search feature to the app, so one could search, stream and download any music. This would perfect play music and increase the rate of downloads. Already, it's been from Google LLC, but adding the feature suggested would make this app top 3. Another feature we can add is the dark mode. Thanks and well done Google LLC. Nick, Nigeria."

      "This is lovely app to listen to my audio book nothing spectacular. There is a feature missing when using this app through Android Auto. When finished listening to audiobook through Android Auto there is no way to start from the beginning, you have to disconnect your phone launch the app select the book index menu then select where on the book you want. The Audible has this feature on Android Auto why can't Google own Playbook?",
      "This is such an amazing application. I've been using it for years. The developers done a terrific job to make this app standout from other ebook platforms. But the only one suggestion that I have is, if you could include the pronunciation feature when you long press a word, then it would be so helpful for the readers. Especially for a person like me who is not a native English speaker.",
      "I want a refund on the audiobook Brisingr because it skips and has static to the point where its inaudible. Just give me my refund! Edit: I have tried doing a refund but your policy doesn't permit it. So I've been forced to contact the developer. Even though there is a legitimate problem with the audiobook.",
      "Stii Broken app. Crashs constantly. Unfortunately Stops working messages are regular now, Developers push too many untested updates. Clearing cache and data does not work but fails. Must reinstall to fix. Already paid for several+ $$$ books. Avoid this poorly maintained app and book purchases ... until issues fixed.",
      "I spent $25 on a book, and I cannot View Offline or Download?? The entire set of instructions on Google Play runs you in circles and is out of date. “Make available offline” is not an option. Adobe Digital Editions that you refer people to (shame on you) does not appear to have any kind of desktop PC application. And you have to give them your complete Google Login Credentials. Can you say \"sketchy\"? Also, I cannot find any information on how to contact a Google Play Customer Service person. This is completely ridiculous. All I need to to is talk to someone to get a refund, or get legitimate instructions on how to accomplish this. I cannot obtain either. I will NEVER buy from you again. Amazon's Customer Service makes this look like robbery."

      "I love using this app for most of my digital media purchases. One problem, though and I'm not sure if it's being looked into or how deep it goes. I think whoever is in charge of creating thumbnails is completely unprofessional. My example is The Magicians in the newer seasons, whoever created the thumbnails is intentionally picking characters making a \"goofy\" face. Season four is a very emotional and powerful season, but the thumbnails created for it make it out to be a complete joke!",
      "Its a really great app. But when ever I'm trying to play some of the TV series. I purchased some episodes won't play. It keeps on saying error and try to restart my device if problem persists. I tried that. And it isn't working. And I still can't watch my purchased movies. When they are downloaded. Only on wifi. Please fix this",
      "The Google has a lot of movies and TV shows because that is only used purchase more than a year. Also you can buying all the movies and TV shows before running out of the money to pay for sales. Then you can to watch the trailer video before someone to pay the bills or rents. I have got plenty time more than one watched in YouTube experience change the world of different kind of a videos are interested in websites.",
      "The refund conditions are far too restrictive - I bought the wrong series in a multi-series show and realised within seconds of opening the first episode. Google Movies terms requires the show is unwatched - there is no allowance for this kind of realisation. The logic seems to hark back to a kind of tin foil wrapper without which resale would be difficult or lower value, even though the content is virtual and Google has the data to know the experience was poor.",
      "Used to be ok but now useless. I keep getting an error when trying to play anything in my library. The error says 'this type of playback isn't supported and I need to use Chromecast instead of mirroring' But I'm not trying to mirror my screen, just watch on my phone. Tried reinstalling the app but no difference. Used to work fine til yesterday so now my movie collection which I have paid alot of money to Google for is not accessible! Needs to be fixed urgently."

      "The best thing I can say about it is, it works. As far as how well, it's seriously lacking, the trophies lack many sorting options that other trophy apps have. The store just takes you to a website instead of being like the Xbox app where it's actually part of the app. It needs a PS Now option to download games to your PS. It has like 6 different apps for different features instead of being integrated in one app. There's a lot of things that need to improve.",
      "Helps keep up with friends, but would like a notification when selected friends go online. A feature that can be used when actively on the Playstation, it will notify you when friends you have chosen log into their Playstation. I would like this in a push notification to the app. If they get on to play, I might go join them. As it is now, I have to open the app and look. Otherwise, I find the app useful to browse the Playstation Store, check on trophies and my account.",
      "The app serves as an essential companion to the PS UI. Betting able to manage nearly all functions either remotely or as a second screen for your PlayStation is so clutch. Being able to buy a game while your away, and download it so that it's ready to go by the time you get home? Greatness.",
      "Allows you to accomplish several things very well while on the go. You can see what games and deals are currently available in the PlayStation store. Order your digital purchases remotely and have them downloaded to your PlayStation before you get home. Connect to the PlayStation blog for news. The app has many more useful functions than I am listing here. If you are a PlayStation owner this is a vital companion app along with PlayStation messages to enhance your PlayStation experience.",
      "While the overall experience of the PlayStation App is fine, it would be good to see an option for party chat with your friends that are in a party on PS4 and the upcoming PS5. Obviously there are plenty of other options regarding chat lobbies, but being able to join active PS4 parties with friends would be pretty good. The PlayStation Vita gave users the ability to join parties with people on PS4 which was a great feature and there is no reason why mobile/cell phones can't do the same."

      "This app is nice if you only intend to earn $10 to $20. This is because the more you earn, the harder it will be to earn the next $$$. Only a few games will reward you with lots of points. Most games are also garbage (typical slot games that you just idle). Honestly, considering the energy your device take, the time that you cannot use your device, and the wear on your device, it might not even be beneficial at all. Kudos to them for being legit though. I've redeemed over $20.",
      "So far this is the best app I have tried concerning winning money and gift cards. It does take time, but all you are doing is playing games. No ads, no tricks. They even offer contests where you can win additional prizes and to enter the steps are simple; download a game and play to a certain level. They add new games for downloads all the time. The only 2 things I would like to see is an Amazn gift card for $20 or $25 and the addition of word search games to choose from.",
      "I play every day and twice now it has taken 25 units off of me which is 50 units in total and claimed I have not carried on the streak when I know I have because I have never missed a day in over 200 days. I get daily rewards on my games yet mistplay claims I have not???! A big con to stop you gaining too many units so they don't lose too much when you cash them in!! Fed up with this game now.",
      "I only downloaded this to work in conjunction with Rise Of Kingdoms. It would be very helpful to install a search capability so players can quickly search for their game rather than scroll through 100 irrelevant ones.. yikes. The online article that referred me to this app gave every indication this is normal use of the app but I can't find the game anywhere on the apps choice of games. Frustrating. Guess the only choice is to uninstall it.",
      "I've had my daily streak reset twice after using the app and playing games through it more than once a day. Also, the apps that give you any amount of points that will eventually add up to a free gift card, are either really hard to run for a mid tier phone or just slot machine games. Get some better games and fix your daily streak. Afk arena is kinda cool."

      "it's a great app, its cheap and the amount of shows and movies is fantastic, but it's still very new so it has it's fair amount of flaws, sometimes while i scroll down it freezes, and it's not just on one deice, it's all of them! also sometimes while im searching for shows and stuff it stops typing the letters/numbers. but other than that it's a great way to watch movies and shows at an affordable price.",
      "Consistent \"Error code 83\" message. I downloaded some stuff to watch and at first everything was great and I watched several episodes just fine. But then I started getting that error 83 message every single time I tried to play one. The help forum says it's a device compatibly issue, but my device worked just fine for several days until this happened. What am I paying for if I can't watch anything anymore? Update: I logged out and then logged back in and ALL my downloads were gone.",
      "Ever since I've got it I haven't been able to watch anything on it. I can stream to my Chromecast but I can't watch on my phone. I can browse the movie's and series but when I actually want to play anything it gets into a loading screen witch litterely takes for ever. When I try to get back to the browsing my whole phone freezes and stops working for a while. Then it shuts down the app. They've told me the app isn't supported by my phone. Which is weird because it is running the required OS.",
      "Sounds is extremely sub par. Dolby Digital is hugely compressed. For a huge corporation this is very disappointing. Way to save money. Netflix audio is awesome by comparison. Netflix sound is still no where near a Blu Ray. 10 second fast forward is broken. Why not spend some money on your app Disney. No... Better to give your shareholders a big fat dividend. Well done!",
      "I love being able to watch old Disney movies, but the page loading times are horrendous (when it loads at all) and when you add in the random crashes and the fact that probably at best 50% of what I try to watch is unable to load for some unspecified reason, I don't see any point in paying for this as I am hardly ever able to use it."

Thank you.",
      "The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it's useful for storing music. The only reasons I'm keeping it... it's a pre-install app in my phone and, it holds songs and original clips that I recorded and don't want to lose. Otherwise it would go straight in the trash. I don't like the layout and I absolutely HATE all of the ads that pop up everytime I open it to listen to music!",
      "I liked the app, easy to use. BUT i have a problem - some of my music folder's names are very long, and i can't see their full name. Can you please add this feature? I mean, that if a folder name is too long it would move / slide in a loop from left to right or right to left depending on the language used. Thank you.",
      "Honestly, in my own opinion, this music player is better than the one I had previously, the one I had previously repeated the same music until you opened the app and manually selected the song you wanted, but this music player is better than that...",
      "VERY GOOD. With this app I was able to set the levels in a way that I filtered out some very distracting sound artifacts from my noise canceling headphones. Not bad for a free app!"

Also update the pro version with additional features like regular one. Its just too outdated that it makes no sense buying the pro version.",

And other thing while playing games there is a 2nd chance for playing the game after watching ads but now it isn't available and unable to beat the score and it been difficult to play...,..... Sometimes I think to quit from games. Please don't make and encourage this type of fricky experiments",
      "App is fully scrap, worthless, fully garbage, always showing ads, irrelevant content to users as the users are not interested in those scrap. Every time tapping to new contant it show the ads, once displayed it takes lot of time to restart the content and very frequent ads. MX player will you state that what is the upper extent of spaming, as you are crossing the limit. In now a days very more apps are available and you are behaving like the dominating one in terms of ads content. Garbage App",
      "Good Player but too many ad. I normally watch \"Crime Satark\". Before ad and after ad you get buffering. Many a times after the ad the serial don't start at all. If I exit from the app & try to reconnect again I get same ad and then after buffering. Due to which compulsorily you can't watch the serial as it don't start at all.",
      "Have been using this for years and is a excellent app that plays most video formats and files. I will now be deleting it and trying to find a alternative as all I want is a player that is lightweight and plays LOCAL videos. I do not want notifications of online videos or push feeds, there are plenty of other apps / players for that. It is evolving...into making more money. Shame."

The ones that the app has aren't really apeeling to me. Crayola please respond because a ton of your games need to be fixed",

      "Love the app! It helped me update play services! For those having issues please go to a computer first. Make sure Google, Microsoft and Google play have the same email address. Make sure to sync all your devices. I think you can add all your emails and devices to your Google account to make syncing easier. I fixed most of this on my own rather than pay someone. It took patience.",
      "Excellent app! It actually boosted the response time when taking actions and improved the graphics on the whole device as soon as it was completely installed. It gives you the tools to check for the latest updates and lets you manage data usage and Storage space for google play apps. And given the option to open the app from within the google play store was like the icing on the cake. Kudos Team! Keep up the brilliant work!!!",
      "For what it is the app is just okay, the app just give convenient shortcuts to the various Google Play essential base apps and the ability to quickly look up the installed version numbers of those apps. I was hoping it would help me clear the current error/issue I'm having with Play Services constant update notification pop-up. But for those unfamiliar with navigating through phone app setting I can see how this is a useful tool, hence why I'm giving it a 4 and not a 2 or 3 star rating.",

Please fix this and any other problems for all the kiddos out there that want to learn and play fun games with there fav. charcters too 😁💜",
      "DISSAPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING!! My son loves PBS. When I think PBS, I think dedication to education and learning and I think Quality. This app falls way short. Crashes, freezes, wont work, too many bugs and inconsistencies with accessing the App. NO !! It's not our devices! This is per other reviews, from personal experience and across multiple and different devices. I know it's free but this is ridiculous. Please get it together. This is a huge disservice to children at this point.",
      "First the game was really fun but after a little bit is stopped working because something happened something happened and it doesn't work when I try to load into the app but in all when you get into the app it's very fun the games are awesome. And everything is so much fun and in all I read this app 3 stars.",
      "OK So This Seems To Work A Bit, But 1 Question, Why Did You Remove The Electric Company From PBS And It's Party Game Lost On Prankster Planet On The App Store? Please Bring The Electric Company Games Back :( And Respond To This Please PBS, If You Respond, I'll Give You 4 Stars, If You Bring The Electric Company Back, I'll Give You 5 Stars And I'm Not Lying I Really Will Give 5 Stars If You Bring It Back :)",
      "There is now sound after a month and a half of no response from dev team. Games crash often, but my four year old loves it. EDIT: the sound goes out daily and i have to reinstall."

      "B'S support!!! We are glad that you received the points, however, once the action is completed the points may take up to 24 hours to reflect on your account. Sorry, we do not have an option to reset your daily points. If the system of rewarded play & daily bonus points are based on a 24 hour system then the gameplay should be rewarded in the same timeframe. Otherwise the player is \"cheated\" out of possible points IE $$$",
      "So glad that it worked! I was using Mistplay (which is awesome, too) and decided to try this one as well. It has multiple times of day where it allows you to get more points playing multiple games for a few hours, surveys, and you can watch ads to support them and or enter a contest to get a 5 dollar gift card. The games you play though do have a limit of having to be played for at least two minutes and those points are only made once a day. But they also have \"extended apps.\"",
      "I just re-installed this app after I took a few months off from it. And so glad I did!! Many more apps than before...and these apps are fun, such that I have a hard time getting my face out of the screen. I had a few points left over from last install, but still I'm pleased at how easy and quickly I earned enough for a $25 Amazon Card. Only took me bout a week!! Only thing that frustrated me were some trouble installing the apps...but that might be with my phone???",
      "Got my first gift card in 2 says ( not counting the days it takes to .process) via email with zero issues. Im now waiting on my second gift card. Win-Win. It can take awhile to cash in (45K), but the games are fun that are listed and you can always delete and switch out for new ones. And the company will do a lot of \" download 4 games, play each day for 3 days, get 3,000 points!\" so things can add up fast. Edited to add: so far now I have earned $15.00 in giftcards.",
      "Poor app, I've been using this app for a while now & now I can't get apps to download. Or play, when I send a support message the answer I get back is \"sometimes games don't play right, if your download outside the app you won't get credit for that game. Any other questions?\" uh yeah, your showing games that don't download or play but you expect people to just find others. Nope, I'm done. There's other apps out there that work, bye......."

      "Literally nothing wrong with my device, however, opening up the YouTube app does nothing. Continuous loading. All I want to do is watch something before going to work, and nothing loads. Absolutely terrible service. Going on the google browser for YouTube works but it's obviously not the same. Fix your damn app. This is ridiculous.",
      "This last update has ruined it all. While we double tap for forwarding the video, the controls, that otherwise used to go away on their own, they just stay there. It's extremely annoying to turn them away every time one forwards or reverses the video by double tapping. Moreover, YouTube is missing gesture controls, which are a must for this much a great app anyways. Waiting for these upgrades.",
      "Ok sometimes this app works but most of the time it doesn't! Laggiest app? YouTube. Everytime I play a video, I have to restart my phone! What is that?! Although it works on my other phone so it does work on that device, but on THAT device, most of the time when I play a video, it freezes and crashes and the audio is still on and doesn't go away until like 4 minutes! SQUASH THESE BUGS!",
      "I don't like that music and certain programs cannot be minimized and played in the background during GPS or other app use. Simultaneous app usage is a key feature to have on a platform that supports podcasts. Please fix this. Also, the algorithm has clearly been tampered with to promote corporate media over progressive media (that has exponentially higher popularity in terms of views) when common search words are entered. The anti Bernie bias is to be expected on CNN, msnbc, or fox.",
      "YT is probably my favourite app but I have problems with the design. It shows that I have watched things when I am just scrolling on mute. Things that I have watched come up as not watched or partially watched. There is a limit on the saved to watch later videos. And this past week I've been having problems with it. It froze when I was trying to type a comment in live chat and I ended up missing half the chat because I thought it must have ended. Now today it is saying YouTube is not responding."

      "It's an ok app. Sometimes the sounds quality is not good, especially when switching to music video. It's a bit buggy, it's not unique, the look and feel of it is like every other music streaming app out there. However the YouTube algorithms is questionable, it often suggest music that I actually detest. So the suggestions are way off the mark. I think because my music taste is very eclectic it can't decide what kind of music I like. YouTube music needs to have a better algorithms.",
      "Totally awesome! Especially when you consider that you get the premium version Free! w/ your subscription to Google Play music. Best deal in music by far. Plus it's just a great app. It has pretty much any song you can think of and most remixes. 4 example, the Pink - Get this party started/ Sweet dreams mix. I could never find it, but on YouTube music... Boom! There it is. And last, but not least they let you download the video or the song or both. Then you can switch between them. 👍🏻👍🏻",
      "Been on premium for 2 years now . I listen to a vast range of music . notice when radio mode it always goes back to my favs . If I'm listening to Billie Holiday I'm not in the mood for Aerosmith . Also I would like to see song info ( writer , producer,) ect. On the plus side it has a very large library 1900 to present , more songs from each era . especially like the comedy .",
      "The entire time I've used this app, I've had problems. I can almost never get music to keep playing past one or two songs. If I try to listen to an album, it will stream the first song and then completely stop, or if it does play, I will have to wait minutes before it happens. Far from seamless, not even close to satisfactory. I've tested it on every connection possible, it does not make a difference and my phone is not the issue. Until they fix this, go with Spotify. Google; get it together!",
      "I use this app all day every day. YT music is awesome. I love the option to not play the videos and just listen to the audio. I can download my playlists for offline listening. Highly recommend obtaining Premium for this app if you are able. I used the free version forever and decided it was worth it to upgrade, and it totally was. That said, even if you don't want the premium, the free version is super awesome and user friendly as well."

      "It's nice to be able to find (almost) all of my favorite songs. Unfortunately, the app randomly stops playing my playlist and flings me back to the last station I was listening to CONSTANTLY. Then I have to sit through ads before I can go back to what I actually wanted to listen to. Fix please, or I'll just get spotify instead. It's not worth the frustration.",
      "After being unable to open the mobile app, I tried deleting it all together and then re-downloading to see if that would fix the problem. It did not. After contacting the developer, the problem was remedied by going into device settings, Apps, where I found that even though I had deleted the app that older versions of the cached data still existed. Once that was all cleared out the app works perfectly 👍 Great customer service!",
      "I have been a subscriber for a long time. In the past 2 months I have been experiencing buffering issues (offline and online) now today I am unable to listen to any music. It has froze. I have restarted my phone, uninstalled the app and reinstalled it then restarted my phone and still nothing. I have unsubscribed today. Poor service.",
      "I can see from all the reviews today I am not the only one getting error code 3005. I've had Pandora since the beginning and even with all the other listening options we have today they are by far my favorite. Despite that today it is not working, I'm not going to drop my rating. Our world is in crisis. There are better things to worry about than a bug on a music app that will likely be fixed within a day. Keep being awesome, Pandora! ❤",
      "I have had Pandora for a few years now. Within the last few months your service has been horrible. Constant buffering even when on a wifi network, songs are not playing completely through and if you skip songs to many times it starts to buffer and does not play the songs all the way through. I have been trying other streaming services and have no problems. I like Pandora but at this rate I am about to cancel my subscription and go to another service if these issues aren't fixed."

      "Dear Sony, thank you for bringing this to non Sony phones, as this helps with development and helps further your work on it. However, there are some improvements that could be made. You need to make it where you can connect to your PS4 anywhere. Not just on the same network. You'll need an octacore processor to run this smoothly. Quad core doesn't work well enough. Too much lag. Get yourself a powerful phone before you start to use this. Word to the wise.",
      "Remote Play used to work great for me. But now, it doesn't work outside my home network like before. This applies to the PC version of RP as well. I can only remote play within my home Network, which is kinda pointless for my situation. I know it connects to my PS4 pro because it says \"registering\" but when it says \"checking internet connection\" it now always says that it's too slow, which I know that's not true. I have over 200mbps. Anyone else having this issue?",
      "I have been using this App to grind out the A.I. simulated matches on Injustice 2. Brilliant!! Is great because it does not require me to actually fight using my phone but allows me to navigate the menus and setup the A.I. to do the loot grinding for me. An overview of my opinion concerning this App is it is great for games that don't require too much button presses... best suited for games like the Telltale series games, Until Dawn, Detroit Become Human or any other of that style.",
      "Great for entertainment, but not ideal if your controller battery dies. Also, you used to be able to connect to your PS4 regardless of if you are on the same wifi as it...my review would be 5 stars if you could connect as long as it is able to be reached, but since you have to bee on the same wifi as the PS4, it's 3 stars. (If its changed, my review will change accordingly.)",
      "They've really improved the app. Works perfectly as intended. <3 I use this almost everyday while me and my GF watch TV or whatever. Have a dualshock connected with a small USB c to micro USB connecting it to myPixel 3, which I have mounted on top of the controller. The Ethernet cable is plugged directly into the PS4. Zeros lag. Zero issues. I love this app. If it ever becomes available in the Nintendo Switch app store I will be so happy. My current setup gets a little heavy is all. 💙"

      "Please add weekly aggregates and 30 day rolling averages instead of just daily and monthly. Please fix the speed at which new data is available. Please fix crash every other time I open the app. Please fix infinite loading indicator",
      "Very useful and much needed up, BUT. Experiencing constant crashes upon launch for over a week now, completely random. What's worse, I'm rarely getting push notifications when customers leave new review! (Yes ofc it's on in settings). I have to manually go to app every few hours and refresh just to make sure I don't have unexpected negative reviews to take care of. Please fix this basic functionality......",

I've enabled it in the app settings and also verified that the app has permissions to do so via the system settings but it doesn't give out any notifications whatsoever for some reason. Also, the app list doesn't load at times. Furthermore, a snack ar saying \"An error occurred\" pops up every single time.",

      "It's better than cable and cheaper than Netflix I have recommended it to my family and friends and they agree and have downloaded it to their phones and even their television to watch it on the big screen, I love it and watch it every day I always find something great to watch for whatever the occasion wether it's comedy,horror,suspense,romance,action,drama, family movies, cartoons for the kids,and even spiritual when I'm having a bad day, Tubi t.v never lets me down.",
      "I was a bit skeptical at first because of the odd movie selections, like titles I've never heard of and some I swear are made by your average person, but I can honestly say I really dig this app, for more than one reason- -Its FREE! you really cant beat that -Titles I've never seen, so I get a sense of adventure (and has some good older films) -ITS FREE!!",
      "I'm not going to complain about ads or curation. My complaint is with the captions. Not every film or TV show has the captions available. I'm not sure if that's TUBI's fault or not but with other apps behind a pay wall, you have the option of using captions or not. Other than that, I don't really have any complaints atm.",
      "The movies are interesting, but occasionally the movie I pick very low budget movies which I believe is not worthy of the cost spent on filming it. Therefore, I believe the detail information on the movies posted about each movie need to be more accurate. This would allow the observer the ability to choose movies with better rating and more interest accord to that individual's likes and dislikes.",
      "Volume is adequate. Closed captions aren't available on everything. Ads are short (15 second to 90 seconds) and infrequent. Downside, it's often the same ad over & over & over & over & over & over & over...Lots of classics too, both TV (not all series have all the episodes but some do) and movies. Navigation is awkward and a bit time-consuming. Ratings include \"R\" but parental controls are available. I wish there was a subscription fee. I'd pay it to eliminate ads."

      "Honestly you do get money. I played enough just to see what happens. I saved up the coins and got the $5 amazon gift card. Now for the money you win...you will get roughly $8 free upfront and then it like a brick wall after that. After a couple months I got to $9.60 and it hasn't moved and of course the cash out limit is $10. So from a coding perspective this seems to have some sort of cap that slows winnings around the $9 mark. You can make money but good luck.",
      "Fun to play. Lots of ways to earn points, but lots of wasted time when you can't use them. Have a hard time sometimes getting videos to play without having to click on them multiple times until I finally stop getting the loading... video error. Sometimes it takes awhile to refill the better gift cards for point redemption, but they get there. It's free, I don't expect perfection. And I've already earned a couple of Amazon gift cards, which is awesome.",
      "I mean its obvious if you continue to use it you'll get more coins and rarely money, but the tokens get harder to build over time as you gain more. Not to mention the $5 for 5 million tokens and $10 for 10 million tokens are always unavailable once you get closer or are at the amount you need for them. The $2 is always available but 3 million tokens for it seems unmatched and unnecessary to me. It's nice for something to pass time but using it in the hopes to get money is delusional.",
      "I have been playing this game for over a month, multiple times a day, and have yet to win even 10 cents. Waste of time. Hours of my life gone to stupid ads. The quiz game might be it's only redeeming quality, yet the logos and images to guess are never changed. It cycles through the same images. I have them all memorized now. Just don't even waste your time.",
      "I've been playing this game off and on for about 4 months now...and recently cashed out two $2 amazon gift cards. I received them less than a week later, so it does pay out to a degree. I have no idea about getting cash from this app, but something is better than nothing, right? It does have fewer ads than several other similar scratch card type apps I've tried out, so I may stick with this one to try to earn more amazon cards."

      "Too many bankrupts and lose a turns. They put the price up on buying hints and paying to go to the next round. Really hard to earn lucky letters now. The game used to be a lot more fun before they made all these changes. Very frustrating. Still too many bankrupts!! A week later, it's not so bad.a couple of weeks later, it's back to bring a bit better again.",
      "So-so game. I don't like that you almost have all your boxes filled and you miss one question and have to start all over. And the daily free spins don't give you your prizes all the time. It will tell you here's your hour of unlimited tickets and then it doesn't give it to you. Frustrating. Kind of boring when you don't get anything for all the puzzles you go through. I've thought seriously about uninstalling the game. Nothing good enough about to keep it.",
      "To progress you have to win the bonus rounds and get their special prizes. Winning the cash from the regular rounds basically counts for nothing. It's kind of annoying since the bonus rounds are like 85% luck. Also, if you fail bonus round it will ask if you want to watch an add for bonus prize, if you say no, they give you one anyway.",
      "It's OK. The paying a ticket to play each round is ridiculous. If you win you shouldn't have to spend a ticket to play again, only if you lose. And the last game I played said I solved the puzzle incorrectly but the next player (computer?) solves it and it's exactly what I had entered to solve it. Must be a glitch. Annoying.",
      "Absolutely ❤this game...Been playing for almost 2 years and it gets better, instead of boring the more you play. As long as they keep the Wheel Challenges where you have 4 or 5 days to complete, and all the newly added tourneys I will continue to play. If they dont I will probablly quit playing as i did before the new upgrades. I enjoyed playing before, but it got boring because to me it was the same thing daily. Therefore Scopely Wheel of fortune dont let us down, please continue...."

      "Nothing works on the app anymore. Worked fine for a while, but now it keeps saying\"what youre looking for isnt here anymore, try something else instead\" but it says that for almost everything in the app. Its frustrating because my toddler really loved this app. And it was the only kid friendly app that is free and educational.",
      "I love the app and so does me children, but I'm trying to figure out why they can't watch live TV on their tablets but I can turn it on off my phone. Everything is logged into our service provider so I'm not sure what's making the difference. I'm not sure if it's because their tablets are Androids and my phone is a iPhone. I just want them to get all the benefits from this app since they love it so much. 😁",
      "I didn't actually use the app, since I downloaded it purely to cast the videos to my tv via google chromecast for my 3 year old, and there is no casting option.",
      "No longer has our internet provider so the kids can no longer watch their favorite episodes. Used to be one of our favorite apps for on the go..",

      "App needs updated and linked to log in information online. I can get on PayPal just fine on my computer, but won't let me in through the app at all. I can't use PayPal app at all because log in information isn't the same. It's all old information, phone number, credit card, security questions. How is it convenient when it's not? Not at all!!",
      "The app has been completely useless to me I made an account and set it up. With my ID and bank card and then I lost my bank card before they could confirm it was mine. I've been unable to update or change my card info ever since; it's been several months and they're tech support has failed to reach back out to me several times. At this point I'm just gonna close my account.",
      "The app is great but not that great. I have been using PayPal to send money and to receive money. But I found it very difficult to transfer money from my PayPal to my local bank account. I use instant transfer button but each time I link my MasterCard to do the instant transfer,it will read your card is linked but is not eligible for instant transfer why please. I'm from Nigeria. The two star I give is for the two work PayPal is doing, sending and receiving cash.",
      "Can never use the app, every time after logging in, and entering code for 2FA, it goes to a blank screen with a X in the upper left corner. If I click the X, I have to login again and do 2FA code again, and then back to the blank screen. If I reinstall the app, it works maybe one time before doing the blank page thing again. I can get get into the app. It's been like this for months now. Nothing seems to ever really fix this issue, and many others seeing the same issue. Please fix this!",
      "I use PayPal for direct deposit from work, and I love it more than any bank I've ever been with. I have a card I can use anywhere in person or online, and the balance on the app is immediately updated so i always know exactly what's in my account. I'm also provided with a detailed list of what & when my expenses were. And money can be sent immediately to other paypal users. No waiting or fees. You can even create savings accounts or money pools. This is an incredible app & i adore paypal.🖤"

      "Best screen time app for Mom's. Only pbs shows, everything is educational! And no commercials! I use it to chromecast (which occasionally doesn't work but it's usually fixed by closing and re-opening) or for last ditch distractions while or and about. So good to not have to work about the content my son could come across. Very well designed to!",
      "This such a great app. My 3 year old has no trouble using it, there are a lot of great shows and some very educational in regards to science and nutrition. I really like that the app has a lot of shows he enjoys that aren't available on our local channel.",
      "This app has not let me or my toddler down. It has always been reliable with the latest episodes even before they air on Mondays. The app has helped us on long car trips and she absolutely loves to see her Elmo, Cat and discover new shows like odd squad and Xavier riddle.",
      "My favorite kids video app ever! Even as a grown up I enjoy the videos when I watch with my kids. Everything is age appropriate and fun. Productions are super high quality they are all well thought and produced.",
      "Love PBS, grew up with it and i'm amazed with all the shows that are still going that my son can now enjoy. Unfortunately shows like Fetch (not the Ruff Ruffman Show) and Peep aren't on the app and the ones that my son watches like Cyberchase and Wild Kratts only have a few full episodes on it."

      "I really like this app because it has so much games and it's so good at because it's for kids and you're going to enjoy it with our total play games instead of downloading all those other two little place that you like and you care don't have enough space on your phone will just get this one and you're obsessed with total play and I hope you guys like itand also the scheme have like over a thousand apps or more but just downloaded this will make my day and it will be such a good thing to do 💜❤",
      "This app is dumb .There is proper network in my I - pad but then also it is showing me unable to connect. I thought that it would be such a good game but this situation made me feel very disappointed and I have 6 games in my phone of tuto toons and they are very good but now my mind has been changed so I will right now delete them all and install other games. I hope that tuto toons will take a action on my this feedback.",
      "I wish I could give this a 0 because it's soooo bad. It tells you that there is no internet when I was using my data and then whenever I tried to download a game it sent me off the app so I had to start again. I thought it was my phone so I powered it off for a whole hour then deleted the app And got it again but it did the same thing. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!! It's rubbish ( fact) .",
      "I love this game because I just love it and I want to show everybody my mind's what is 2 so inspiring that I have multiple times have almost play did all of them I'm up to 90% And is 100 so I am going to try to get them all done today but apparently I have finished today so that's why I love this game is that you can play anytime anywhere where does internet or just anywhere so I'm recommending this game to anybody that doesn't like it please try to my router Lucy devil dot-com Lucy doll dot-com",
      "Good but ads are coming and internet is not working. But I like this game so much it have so much games in it my brother also like this game but I don't like the thing in it that internet is not working in ads are coming."

      "Okay.....your app is starting to really be upsetting, some movies and shows won't play, some have no Sound still even as I'm writing this. Some keep making you watch Ad after ad and not playing the movie at all. Just infinite ads. It's like hit and miss. Win some lose others. Bad Boys for Life still have no Sound, Russell Peters Deported won't play. Frozen 2 stops work after so much in the beginning of the movie. When these things are fixed I will bum the score up. As of right now 50/50.",

      "This used to be my favorite app but i paid for the premium subscription and it is still showing ads when I go to movies and when I click out of the ads the movies won't play, I am very disappointed. hopefully they get these issues fixed and it goes back to being my favorite app",
      "This app is good but sometimes it won't play movies or TV shows and says to watch an ad and after you watch the ad it won't let you watch the movie sometimes I watch the ad three or four times and still won't let me watch I just hope they would fix it",
      "I tried to watch Fast and Furious 7 and sometimes the movie didn't play or it said error but most of the times all the movieswork how they sould and. Another thing I don't like is how many ads they play when you're trying to watch a movie like I know you want I know there's two or three ads when you push a movie and you try to watch it and then when I try to know when I push the movie there's an ad before the movie so I tnink they sould not put as many ads as they all ready have its a not goodd"

      "I love this app! Yes, it has commercials during the tv shows but you can watch a lot of shows shown on tv/cable the very next day on this app. You can go back in time and watch some old shows you use to love and have forgotten about. For example, I found and have been watching \"The Six Million Dollar Man\". There are movies, investigative report shows, news reports...you name it, you can probably see it. This app is definitely worth trying!",
      "This app gives me any news feed I may want! Thank you for the hard work! Well done! I'm changing my review of your app. Why? Because every news channel runs fine except FOX NEWS the entire reason i got the app. You are intentionally interrupting it and or slowing it down. Ive recorded it with my other devices to show any and everyone who my want to see it! Im going to share that info with my chat buddies and FOX NEWS! Such a shame you were doing realy well for the first month!",
      "I appreciate the variety of shows offered. I am not a sports or political enthusiasts but this app isn't all about just those. I don't mind the ads, they are not excessive and they have not played during a video clip. Ads is what keeps apps free and I find things I wouldn't normally know existed; they also give my eyes a break when I don't want to shut down. This Free TV app also don't put spyware or extra hidden apps or files on your device (at least any that I have found) that take up memory",
      "Needs some major work on the Chromecast. I have to go to the Google Home app & select which device I want (I have 2 Chromecasts). Then I have to go to the Freecable TV app & select which show I want to watch. I have to make sure my phone is horizontal & not vertical. My phone can't snooze (to save battery life) or it quits playing in the TV. Fix these problems & I'll give 5 stars.",
      "This app is much bigger than Pluto TV, I like the entire concept of the way it's been shown to me, it has a huge amount of news, entertainment, movies, updates classic TV shows and I also enjoy the clips from the latest episodes, to say this is a must have app is more like a must keep app! Thank you very much!!!👍🍿👍🍿🎬"

      "The app certainly gets the job done, however it's far from the smoothest experience. It can be difficult to find new things of interest to watch, particularly without proper genre browsing and no recommendations. As well, streaming to a Chromecast is finicky. There's no option to skip intros or recaps and there's no autoplay for watching episodes back to back. Episodes also occasionally start in the wrong language. Hopefully these things will get fixed in the future.",

I probably won't renew at the end of my subscription period. The app also uses over a gigabyte of storage...why? Netflix uses 212mb. Disney+ uses 345mb, and prime uses 627mb...smh",

I guess if i had to suggest what things i would like to have on starz its the following:1)more horror movies,2)more tv shows of all types especially horror, supernatural related content,ghost hunting and other shows like V series season 1 n 2. I would love to see just overall faster releases of old and new content available but in a good benecial way of course.also classic movies would be a nice addition too",

Was on hold for an hour and a half so ent email and the message I got back was it will take 16 to get a response. Can't watch the shows, can't get any help yet the charged my credit card."

      "Good app with personalized features. Can sync between TV, tablet and phone. The thing is, it's not user friendly with clear tabs that allow you to click on your favorites especially for a non smart TV. And each item setup or appearance is very different. If I wasn't so bored in isolation I'd give this app 3 stars, but for now I'm reasonably entertained.",
      "This is awesome. Works great. I dont really like the new update. Changing channels is more difficult now and on my roku I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it to work again. It's free though so I'm still giving 5 stars. Please add more channels. The Office channel? That 70's Show channel? Joe Rogan podcast channel? Please keep up the work! You're awesome!",
      "It's ok, but could be better. It would be nice if it had a search feature. It doesn't pick up my device. When I hide channels I don't want to watch, they still come out in the lineup. I mark my favorite channels and it works, but when I exit the app and get back on, it erases everything I marked under favorite.",
      "I love this app. I use it on my firestick. Everything is free (for real free not just some of it and then pay for additional). I use the app one my phone for the remote but can also use the firestick remote to change channels etc. I am actually surprised at how much content is available. There is also on demand options. There are ads. I don't think the ads are too much considering EVERYTHING is free but you might see the same one a few times in a row.",
      "I've lost the ability to use the PIP option. It will no longer play as I am on facebook, or on another app. I loved that feature as I was always able to keep up with the news as I played on my apps. I have checked every option, and I no longer see the PIP option..was it removed? I am on my android phone. Thanks *Update* I've not received a reply from your customer service on this issue. Please advise."

      "It's a great game, but the membership status is a little unfair. First, you get more stars, you get new items, you get medium and large houses, you get to have a catapult, and you get the power to have unlimited pets. Players who don't have membership are extremely weak against membership players. Furniture for non-membership is terrible, the armor stats non-member players get is as high as six, and members get so much more stuff! It's a bit biased, don't you think?",
      "Definately a great game for both math skills and entertainment. Everything is amazing. Graphics are good in a cartoon-ish sort of way, gameplay is well thought out and the plot of this game is divine. The only thing I wish the developers of this game would change, is having some things only available to members. Some players like myself, do not spend money on video games. If you could make math prodigy completely open for free to everyone, this would be one of the best games I have ever played.",
      "Best game is one I would recommend for all ages to test your mathematics skills and experience a good time with math. I have played this since I was in first grade. Might be a little kidish, and expensive for the membership to do certain things in it. But over all it is fun and educational. It is addictive and is a great time killer.",
      "ILL ABSOLUTLEY LOVE IT!!!! One note though: I wish we could name our teammates!! I was battling a Forest caller and wanted to name it badly and ofc you can block non -Appropriate names. But other wise totally recommended plus a very good thing about it, is that is goes up to middle shcool ( 8th grade ) and if it seems like a kiddie game, think of it as a math version of pokémon!!!",
      "This is the best math-platformed game i've ever played even when I didn't own a membership it still rolled on to be my favorite game even at school we assign time to this. For example like after a test we take next eould be, Prodigy mt school loves this and The plot your placed in makes you kind of feel a bit heroic and this game is hilarious, fun and some times you'll get mad like if you lose a battle and I really love the Cute , Adventurous , Fun type of game it is I suggest you get this game"

      "The new updates are terrible. They make the product almost completely unusable compared to previous versions. It should not take 10 seconds or more to load a playlist, and I don't care how many tracks there are on the playlist. Playlists linger after I have tried to delete them. The only thing the updates have fixed is blank playlists showing up. That's still simply not good enough if the trade off is an app that lags so much you're considering using the crappy pre-installed app. Nonsense.",
      "Dysfunctional, Frustrating! Lame Settings. Paused video disonnects casting and begins playing on my tablet at a random time or another video! Timeline repeatedly vanishes and makes resuming video at select points frustrating and embarrassing (audiences). Highly over rated app. Does not play well on my Samsung tablet. Okay to watch a non-stop video but stop and go doesn't conform to a pleasant experience. Nothing like the computer version. Icon signifies that you should avoid this half baked app.",
      "I really love this app, I've been using it for a good 6 years now downloading it on every new phone I bought. Love the playback speed option, the ability to slow music tempo and keep the same tone of the song is a very nice feature, I just wish it kept the sound quality too. Other than that..its a very great app VLC",
      "Resize options are all the same aspect ratio, showing the same vertically stretched picture for lots of videos, except 3:4 which is not helping . Most 4K videos, mkv, gets stretched. HD movies also get stretched if I use another player, like YouYube, and then go back to VLC. Only way to fix it is to restart the box. That only fix HD though. Tried reinstalling, but no luck. It refuses to show black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Box is MINIX U1",
      "I love VLC. Had it for years on my PC. On the phone Ive stuck with it while it develops and improves. My only problems on the phone are two things. Firstly the auto volume reduction when it thinks the vol is too high. It would be great to disable this. Why ? Because I dont just feed it to headphones. I play back through a Hifi system and its annoying it randomly reduces the volume withiut warning. Two. The auto scrolling of file titles. Really, really annoying when they are long !!!!"

      "I think this app is great! There's so much to do.. IF you pay after trial. I think $7.99 is too much money for what you get. 2.99 would work. It needs to be WAY more interactive .. that would help. I LOVE THE LITTLE BALLOON yoga. My son didn't really enjoy it, but I thought it was AWESOME!😟",
      "Well, the truth is not to have to pay the premium version by force does not let you do anything if you do not have it is the ugliest app in the world I hate it. My kids want to play with this app but they themselves tell me *hey mommy because I can't do this you help me please* and how you say no to a child as tender as is my son This is the worst I hate",

      "I just purchased this App last night and subscribed but when my kids starts playing it is so slow. I like the app because it is so educational but we have to wait for 2-3 minutes to load because how slow it is. Waste of time. It is not worth the money if this will happen everytime my kids use this app. I hope they have to find a way to fix it. UPDATE MY REVIEW!! Hello, I found out that using this game works better in their website without running slow than playing in the app. GO TO THE WEBSITE",
      "It's fun and it is not just 1 game,but a bunch of games in 1app,children of any age can play it and kids can learn faster no matter if they are in kindergarden,1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th,6th,and above and beyond.😊",
      "This app is incredibly slow and does not work. I would consider not paying them 10 bucks for a non functioning app. Funny thing is it was working untill I subscribed and logged in. Then it stopping loading content",
      "I have to put one at least one star to rate this, but i would rate this 0 stars! Everything is glitchy and slow, i didnt even get to play a game yet! Warning: do not download",
      "Im sorry, but every time I try to click search it will start to lag more and more until the game crashes. And ive only been playing this game for 1 minute. Im not trying to hate im trying to inform."

      "The app is not working properly on my device (Huawei Nove 3). I've uninstalled and re-installed it, updated to the latest version, but still not working how it was before. The video is playing but only shows a black screen. Audio was out of sync. It just started last week and I am unable to watch anything from my device (downloaded and not). Can yoy please hwlp me with this one cause it's frustrating.",
      "It's an unbelievably disappointing experience to me.. I subscribed for a month and within a week I had to change my mobile.. When I tried signing in on my new mobile, it said that my password is incorrect.. I tried resetting the password a hundred times till date.. But it was constantly displaying the following on the screen \"something went wrong , please try again later\".. Does it mean that I should be trying till my subscription ends? How do u expect me to sort this out?",
      "My app all of a sudden stopped working \"sorry we cant connect to Netflix service (-79). I've uninstalled the app. Reinstalled the app. Cleared data. Cleared cookies. Clear cache. Reset phone. I am not on wifi. Have unlimited data. And still nothing works. I even created a NEW account. This is ridiculous. Nothing else on my phone is having issues. Maybe I'll switch to another streaming service. What's the point in having a premium account If I cant use it.?",
      "I'm having so much issues with my app all day. I contact Netflix and the problem still is not fix. Now Everytime I try to log in it's always shutting off the second I click on it. I've deleted and re download more than 20 times and I'm still having issues. Now I'm not sure what to do I'm giving this a 1 just for now but other than this problem is 5",
      "After the latest update, Netflix no longer works on my Galaxy A50. Was unable to log in with my (obviously correct) credentials. Attempted to restart, uninstall and reinstall, same problem. Was working fine this morning before I applied the latest update. Now I can't even log in without getting a (-74) error. Clearing data and cache doesn't do the trick either. Please fix."

      "This has been one of my favorite games for quite a while now. I used it when I had my Ipad, now I just use it on my android phone and I'm ok with that but playing it on a 10in screen is far superior than any other. With that being said, I am reviewing this game much lower than I would have normally simply because I have purchased a monthly subscription and have had trouble playing any songs. I play well and am awarded points yet lots of times I'm shown to have zero points .",
      "Quality of sounds is excellent! Design of the graphics showing the realistic looking keyboard personally I've found an inspiration to continue practicing digitally until my skills are improved enough to upgrade to the professional version and/or move onwards in getting my own keyboard to play not only at home but elsewhere also. More than anything I'm finding this App to be fun, user friendly and helpful in getting me to the next level of musical ability.",
      "so there is this glitch where in the middle of a song when I press the next note it keeps going on to the end with the note-circle stuck on the in game keyboard. but it is still a great app!!!!!! it's great because there is a free mode piano center. also i am not british.",
      "I am very sad as I love the game and have been playing for a long time. Recently every time I complete a song it shows me how many coins I will receive but it doesn't get added to my account it just says 0. This is really annoying as there are so many songs I would love to purchase but can't because I am not receiving my reward coins. Very disappointed"

      "This app is a bit different than the others ive played. I liked how it has a strumming and note plucking technique to it. However, i had difficulties in getting the app to pick up on the strumming. Ultimately i deleted it. I gave it 3 stars due to the fact that others may not have experienced the same problems i had.",
      "For now, maybe latter if it is a good app i'll update. Ok only a few songs in and i try to watch an ad for a song, and guess what? You right the ad won't play says try back latter. Well started with 3 stars now down to one.game is riged they want you to pay for everything.... Don't belive me go try it for yourself. This is NOT a play game it is a pay game.ok 3 months latter and still the same thing. Your game is junk. Deleating forever..........",
      "This app is awful. The songs are bad and unheard of, the price for subscription is WAY too high, they present it as a fun game only to trick people into forgetting they have auto subscribe on so they can make a big year hard charge.",
      "NOT FREE as Advertised. $50 after 3 day trial. Not only liars, with false advertising but gouging people for a game they can play for free on the many other apps that work exactly the same.",
      "Like it but you can only play the songs that don't require you to watch the video because you get a message saying that there are no videos at the time try again later and I have an same thing happen again."

      "In this game there are little avatars that can chat and play games with eachother, and they are soooo cute. But they only problem was that it is extremely laggy and sometimes kicks you out. If you have the patience to wait for it to load then I would totally recomend this game to you! Although, if you have a hard time with patience then I would not recommend this game to you. Other that the lagging issue I think this game is really fun! Just take into consideration that you may have to wait.",
      "Thanks for the Daily login we get 10 cash or 5. It would be nice if it stays 10 cash for every month. Since I personally and my daughter be buying cash every month. It's been lagging a lot lately LP. If you would fix those bugs it would be nice. Can you also give us the ingredients we need for the new event in the Atelier since we have to gather those and it's really hard to get the rare ones. Other than that I love LP. Hope that the new stuff being added to this game would be surprising to us.",
      "Well, the game used to be fun until they almost entirely got rid of the social aspect of it. As sad as it is, I've spent at least a couple grand on Line Play and it didn't feel like such a big deal to me because I enjoyed playing it and I enjoyed going and talking to friends in the lounge. Since they've gotten rid of the lounge and Las Vegas square, I've honestly had no interest in playing this game and probably won't spent another dime on it. I'm sure it'll die completely soon anyway.",
      "the loading is horrendous. This is terrible. I have a strong internet connection yet it's still so slow, It always says to check my internet connection, yet my internet is connected and there's no trouble when I tried using another games that uses internet. I really wanted to give 1 star but the graphics are cute though",
      "It's so slow and it loads all the time. Even though I have a very strong internet connection, it always loads and says that my internet connection is slow as heck when it's really not. Try to fix this please because I think I spend more time waiting than playing the game. I would give more stars and enjoy the game even more..."

      "I would give 5 but recently it started playing different songs than what it said. I figured it was my phone so I tested it when I later got a new one (for different reasons) and the same thing happens. It says x song but I'm hearing y song. It wouldn't be a problem if it was just when I'm scuffling ALL of my songs but it happens when I'm listening to one of my playlists. Itll play songs that aren't even on the playlist. Please fix this, its very frustrating",
      "A great app for playing your music. The interface is costumizable and many skin options to choose from. You can edit song tags, playlist and add album covers. The colors match the album cover which is a nice visual. The free version has pop up ads and the EQ is not that perfect, but overall is way better than Google Play. Highly recommend.",
      "I find this to be a great music player. I wanted a music player that would recognize folders because of how I sort my music . The previous app I was using developed a bug that would automatically play the last song from my phone when I got in my car weather her I called it up or not. I still really like this music player, but I don't like the adds that interrupt everything. I decided to spend the 6.99 ONE-TIME purchase to remove adds. My subscription went through as .99/monthly. This is the choice that I didn't want. I don't know how to change this. They just forced me into the more expensive plan. NOT COOL!",
      "This is the best media player I've used by far. No gripes whatsoever, keep up the good work! Edit: VERY unfortunate that I have to re-rate this app so low... It seems they started focusing more on full screen, spammy ads than the actual experience of the user. It lags horribly now and will even completely hang up mid-song forcing you to restart your phone before it will play again (that or do a hard restart of the app which is a long process when you have the widget install on your homepage).",
      "This is a fantastic music player . . . when you buy it. The ads are super-intrusive if you don't. Have fun waiting five seconds for the playable ads to disappear every single time you want to switch songs. Docked it a point for that. Still rated it a four though because what is there is great. Making playlists and editing tags are easy to do and you can customize how it looks using either the basic colors the app offers or even using pictures from your phone. It's a good."

      "I detested the idea of paying for cable and an additional sub to the content provider itself. Reluctantly, bit the bullet and subscribed. After a few docs there appeared to be a noticeable delay between the video/audio on mobile devices. Saw reviews that ESPN ignores issues/feedback reported. Sent them a message anyway. Of course the generic response back, 'Were aware of the issue and are working to resolve it as quickly as possible' ...any chance it gets fixed before I cancel?",
      "Should be much better. No matter what you go to, whether you drilled down to see scores or reading an article, if you switch to something else on your phone, say to read a message, when you switch back to it, it starts over at the home page. Makes you want to spit nails. Very sloppy. ESPN should be able to do better than that.",
      "Glitches galore, streaming is terrible, sad a multi billion $ corporation cant put out an app that doesn't require buffering every 15 seconds for their shows behind the pay wall. I rarely write reviews, but a week of maddeningly terrible experiences, I've had enough. I wouldn't dream of paying for a PPV for a fight with them, as I wouldn't trust it.",
      "When I click on the \"Watch\" button, all it does is show a blank screen with a spinning Buffering icon at the top. I am logged into my DirecTV account, and all of my other streaming apps work just fine. This app used to work, but I think the latest update may have broken it. It's pretty much useless now.",
      "The app goes out of its way to spoil every fight before you watch it, it's nearly impossible to find the event you want to watch because ESPN doesn't care about what number the event is and you can't sort by date, when casting the time slider doesn't work at all, I get constant ads about Kobe Bryant, the streams just stop completely and disappear from the app, and after a couple min it'll switch off of what I'm streaming and decide to play something entirely different. This app is pure garbage."

      "The app is good but there is a huge problem, recently added songs to my device is not recognized by the app, hence is super annoying and no matter what matter I do, the problem is not corrected. This problem occurred in the recent update, never had this issue before, would give a 4 or 5 stars if not for this problem. The recently added songs are on my device(SAMSUNG A30) but is not recognized by the app itself, PLEASE FIX.",
      "What is it that I have to do to be able to click on the first song in an album, and then have it play the whole album in the right order? What is the arrows circling with an A in the center icon for? It only shuffles the currently playing album, whether I have shuffle on or not. This app didn't used to do that, so what happened? You consider \"Next song is not played in some models\" (in [16.2.21.6] fixes) to be an improvement? It seems like all kinds of weird random stuff is not working properly with this app, going off the other reviews. What happened to the quality we used to get with Samsung?",
      "Not good, the music suddenly just stops. I had a Samsung galaxy S5 and the music would play for a while then just stop, so I had to press the play button again, it happened very often, I assumed it was because I had an older model, I've just upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S10, I've downloaded this app and it does the same thing again, plays for 5 mins and then just stops, please tell me why Samsung?",
      "Up until yesterday, I've loved the seamless way Samsung Music manages music, especially playlists . However, after the most recent Android system upgrade, my playlists have been stripped of all their tracks.  The songs are still there, visible on my SD card,  but the most important part of the equation (the playlists) have disappeared. When will this problem be fixed? I'd be happy to give this app 5 stars once it resolves this issue",
      "Good app, nice UI interface for on-phone music but inflexible when it comes to selecting which music to include in your collection. It will select all music file types on your phone (including call recordings, ringtones, etc) and include them in your library with no capability of excluding tracks/folders. it's all or nothing. It's a shame since otherwise this is a very good interface for playing music. It will also link to Spotify (but you can't log into it) but no other streaming services."

Sometimes the music stops between tracks until I unlock the screen.",
      "My phone was having problems with a number apps, it could slow down and I was forced to uninstall a couple of other music apps, document viewing apps, even shareit as well, but I'm glad this music player is running perfectly fine. It never slowed down my device, neither did it fail to respond like the apps I was forced to uninstall did. The features of this app are really good, a number of options which I can 'manipulate' as per my wish.",
      "This works well so far, it comes complete with bass boost and equalizer (and they actually work). And for once I can edit my song's tags, it this is a amazing and efficient app. It's got customizable everything on it as well even the color! Keep up the good work and I love how if you do decide to buy this app its not over priced either just 2$ thanks again whoever developed this app.... had this app for six months now it still works great organizes my videos and my music awesomly!!!",
      "Excellent. It displays folders with music and can play it. You can rewind a song forward or back, a feature not every music player has, but this player has it. Other players are full of unnecessary features that are annoying, but this one is simpler and easier to use.",
      "This is the best, quickest, user friendly application I've come across in all my years of trying out hundreds. If you like your music then download and give this a go. I love the options, esp to record and drive mode. Good job guys."

      "If you don't want to lose your pictures and videos, USE GOOGLE PHOTOS. I still have pictures from 2014 because I use this app. And I don't have to hassle when I get a new phone either, I just log into Google photos on my new phone and boom I have them all at my fingertips again. It's just smart and easy. Yeah there are a few things I wish we're different, but otherwise it's awesome.",
      "It's very slow to open. Whenever you freshly open the app you need to wait for a minute until the app open completely. After that you will have to wait for the images to load one by one which I find so irritating because of time consuming. Please 🙏🏻 Google! Do something about this. I would love to use this app as my primary Gallery app, not just a backup system. 🙏🏻",
      "Need some more features. So you can hide some of your photos in your gallery. If someone can have your phone and look into gallery they won't have access to your private photos and videos this feature would be alot appreciated and what I noticed is that it gets slower when it has more videos and photos. Hopefully Google guys will be improving these features in the next update",
      "Backing up photos are great, but it bugs out too often! Everytime I move my photos to a different folder, the app will automatically create a duplicate in the original folder! And if I delete the duplicate, it deletes both pictures from the phone. It completely misses the point of \"moving\" photos. Sometimes the photos don't even load and are just gray squares. Makes everything look unorganized. I wish Pixels came with a regular gallery app.",
      "Well, you know, this app is really good but you still need to pay to get more storage. Like why isn't at least one thing free nowadays? To play games you need to pay if you want a premium upgrade. To watch movies you need to pay. To read books you need to pay! And what do you expect me to do? Where do I learn from if I have to pay to read a single online book?! That needs to be fixed, just like this"

      "It is really nice for her to enjoying watching her shows and she also says it's interesting and entertaining and some videos you can learn about ABC and 123and it helps other kidsnshe shows her friends at the park and says it is really nice to watch and learn new things so we really like YouTube Kids and I think other people will to this app is so exciting for kids all over the world and whenever she is supposed to go to bed she upset because she likes YouTube Kids a lot she watches it everyday",
      "Thanks! Very useful! It helped me prevent my kids from watching those Anime girls thing, I was very disappointed to acknowledge that my son is watching such inappropriate Anime cartoon at his 6 years old, but now he's unable to watch it anymore, he kinda rant about it but I don't care, I just give my son what's best, thank you once more",

    "comments":[
      "Thanks for adding an option for loyalty cards storage. Could you please add editable fields for the cards like Notes or something where you would be able to save PIN-codes and other info about your cards (yes, sometimes loyalty cards have PINs). Also most cards look the same (except for well-known global brands like Adidas). Hope they will have the desing of physical ones in the future. Or at least add an option to change colors.",
      "Great app when it's working. I have 2 different cards set up in my Google pay app, both are contactless cards. Without any sort of logic, they both disappear from my profile after a couple of days and I have to go through the whole process of adding them and setting up contactless payments. Very inconvenient when you try to make a payment and when you get your phone to the terminal a message shows up \"set up contactless\"",
      "For some reason, Google Pay does not work for me at all. I get an error message as soon as I open the app. When I contacted customer service via chat, they told me a specialist was not available to help. Then I called a number that was customer service for Google Pay. After being on hold for 1 hour, a \"specialist\" told me I'd get a response in 48 hours. I got a generic email response and nothing else. Super disappointed with Google customer service.",
      "It's literally the best p2p payment app out there....and now it has stopped working for me. I can't send or receive $$ no matter what I try. I've added new payment methods, I've even tried creating a new account and it still won't work. I have contacted support about a dozen times and each time I am told \"I escalated your payment issue to my specialists and I'm pleased to tell you your payment issue has been resolved\". But nothing has been resolved! I've been stuck in this loop for a week!! AHH!",
      "Positive: paying by phone is really convenient. Negative: this has not really been approached from the perspective of someone with multiple cards/accounts from the same bank. You can give cards nicknames (like \"joint account\") but most of the screens that allow you to choose between different cards don't display these nicknames. The new Android OS update uses the power button to display the cards quickly but lack of nickname makes it useless. Nearly awesome but lack of thought makes it clunky."

      "The old app was so much better. This new one is a mish-mash of an interface. Harder to find what you want, no apparent way to customize the order of categories, and my custom topics show nothing but unrelated garbage, whereas it didn't before. **Edit: The various updates have brought improvements, but it's still nowhere near as good as the old app.",
      "Seems like a nicely streamlined way to access news and entertainment. The interface is user-friendly (though sometimes when I click on the main links at the bottom, i.e. For You, Following, etc. I get no response). My concern : I'm subscribed to The New Yorker, which you can access through this app. But each time it asks me to verify my account, which I do (quickly redirects you to the New Yorker site), though it says \"Confirmed\" I still can't access the content and I'm told to verify again.",
      "**UPDATE** --They fixed my issue with copy to clipboard, so I fixed my rating-- *OLD*Copy to clipboard feature no longer available . Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still isn't back. I'm assuming it's now part of an update with this... Was my favorite news app for years and years now but now that I have to jump through a bunch of hoops to share a link to an article, it is frustrating daily using this app.. looking for a new news app...",
      "Update: Excellent customer service! I received an immediate response from my initial review and was provided guidance on how to clean the cache to resolve my concern about excessive data. It still requires a lot of data space but I love the app. One recommendation: I would love to have the option to save specific articles so that I can return to it later. Thank you!",
      "Great app to keep oneself up to date on t he daily news both nationally and internationally. In this age of so much information streaming around the world at such a fast rate, the Google News app goes a long way to helping inform oneself and get an understanding of what is behind the reasons for why or what is happening. Thanks to the hard working staff at Google News, your work is much appreciated by this reader."

      "Has earned a spot as one of my ultimate go-to apps for normal to obscure video playback, easily on par with VLC player...BROAD video extention playback compatibility/support, very stable runtime, 10/10 settings customizabilty, & all while lacking a noticeable presence of advertisement. Definitely recommend this to anyone & can't wait to see what else you do with it. Great work, Thank you!!!",
      "Update: Don't face any problems now. Awesome app. Original: I love the app. But I have one complaint. When connected to a Bluetooth headset (Sennheiser HD 4.40BT) I find some latency between the audio and video in this app. Things work perfectly in YouTube and MXPlayer so I don't think it's a hardware problem. Would be great if that could be fixed.",
      "I have been using it for a couple of years its the best both Vedeo and music player.One day when i tried to a make a music play list it suddenly dinied me access and stopped functioning i tried to clear data and force to stop openned the app same issue ,,i just could not rate 5starts unless the problem is fixed...am waiting for your update and big time i uninstalled it several times the app is showing me same promblem of closing itself when i Make a playlist.,...i dont knw why ?!!",
      "Every time I try to play a video it start buffing for a long time and I had to back out to again play again to make it play. Yes, it doesn't matter what video you are watching it occurs constantly. Everything you said I type it, I even restarted my phone from factory and, still had issues with it,",
      "I love this app so much that I kept it for 9 months now, can I recommend some changes to the home for some more exciting designs or textures. Still the best video player app I have ever used.. If your asking me for a better video player app, I totally recommend this app for you!"

      "its a fine music app, i just wish there were some adjustments that could be made. for one, the orange color primarily used is ghastly and honestly painful on phones that use primarily dark mode. it would be nice to be able to change this color, or at least have a darkmode friendly setting. its also unfortunate that you are unable to choose song by letter, as you can in so many other apps. otherwise, it works as intended",
      "I like this app very much. It has a sleep timer that I use when I go to sleep and it helps me through the night when it stops. The shuffle algorithm goes through all the songs instead of select ones and I really appreciate that. I would rate it 5 stars if it allowed me to change the album covers, but other than that, this app is great!",
      "I like this music player app! I've tried over 20 players and this one is easy to use. I can easily access songs on my phone to make my playlist with this app, very little to no searching to find the songs I want! (I have over 5,000 songs on my phone, so having them arranged the way this app categorizes them makes it much easier for me!) Thank you for this app! One of the best free music apps I've tried!",
      "I give 4 for the so far performance for me is very nice. The UI is simple easy to use unlike the other mp3 apps were complex and annoying to use. This one is not hassle shifting from artist to album to songs to folder is readily on the screen so quick. I will give 5 soon if performance is constant. Ladies n gentlemen out there I recommend this app just what I have enumerated, experience it for utself, anyway it's easy to uninstall.",
      "I love this app! It is convinience to use and it really exceeds my expectation. What I love about this is there is no advertisements and there is an option what's to show and hide as well and folder scanning. Really love it!!! 5 stars Thumbs up to developer of this app!!"

      "The game was good for a while until I foolishly entered a \"Rookie\" tournament, where I was matched up against someone who was clearly playing in Expert or higher. There needs to be a limit to the trophies for each of the tournament levels. Grinded for ages to get to the entry fee and this is what I get as a result. Not worth the effort. Glad I didn't pay any real money. Uninstalled",
      "Love this game, really. It definitely still has some bugs to be fixed. Some issues I'm having is inviting friends to play the game, opponents still show disconnecting all the time, issues swapping balls at the beginning of the match, etc., but I still love playing it. Very fun. Very addicting. Wish there was some fun designs for putters, or upgrades since I have missed getting even close to the hole on some full powered putts before.",
      "I read a lot of complaints about not being able to get good clubs so as to advance. Your problem is that you are trying to go to far to fast. NEVER go up a tour without previous closed and properly upgraded clubs.its a marathon not a race. As for money spending of course if you like the game buy something to show you appreciate those greedy developers. Graphics are well done and ball physics are well designed. I mean the wind does what it should (mostly). This my second account, I addicted.",
      "A game more designed to suck more money out of your wallet than a real round of golf. Ridiculous cost of updating clubs, and good luck trying to keep up with the cost of tours from 5 and up as your LUCKY to win 50% of your games? Try saving? The cost of balls required to keep up with the Joneses are also going to eat away at any gems you accumulate! Need more gems, need to upgrade your clubs ? then par for the course your going to have to dig deep if you expect to get past tour 5 and 6. $$$$$$$",
      "This game is great when you first start playing. Now that i just updated this game it wont even load past 80 % One of the better golf games i have played . The biggest problem is that it gliches alot. You will not build up your coins. When ever you do the game gets glichier. It will boot you out of shootouts so you loose your coins. The arrow for shooting will not stop and mess up your shot. Its one thing to loose when its your fault it another thing to loose when the game forces you to."

      "What a scam. Payment method expired so after a couple months decided to cancel the subscription. Cancelled they a few days later updated payment methods for other apps. They then decided to reinstate my subscription for Noggin without permission. I'll never use this again.",
      "The recent update has changed the entire layout. Its much more confusing now with games mixed in with the episodes. The names of episodes no longer show either. When you're done watching/playing be sure to close out of the app completely or the show moght start up/continue on its own several minutes later. This is especially creepy in the evening. I'm hoping for an update/fix soon otherwise we'll be cancelling our subscription.",
      "I have this for my four year old. he played the games and watches shows. we have it on a tablet and two TVs. never a problem. $8 a month is cheaper than cable.",
      "If I could give less than the 1 star I would. The app is very misleading. It keeps saying it can't connect to my internet on all of my devices. I thought it was just the one but then it's all of them. Not worth continuing a subscription. My son couldn't get into anything the 2 days we were allowed to get into the app. I know it's not my internet. I'm switching to a different learning app."

      "Glad to have this app on android but it's so buggy it's barely usable. I have it on an android tablet, and the \"now playing screen\" is so narrow in landscape mode that I can't read the name of the song currently playing, nor can I skip or rewind (because those buttons are cut off) nor can I view lyrics (button is cut off). I wish there was a setting to disable the split screen \"now playing\" mode. Also wish there was a way to attach a screenshot to show this problem.",
      "As of today it doesn't play music. It began freezing when I was switching songs and now does not work at all even after restarting the phone. Also, I don't think it's fair or reasonable that simply because I switched from an iPhone to Android, that I should suddenly have to pay to play my own music - there should be an opt out of the subscription, if I've missed it, do tell me! Prior to this, I was quite happy with this service overall.",
      "Android and web app are afterthoughts and do not work well. I often get errors with poorly formatted text that say I am out of devices. I only have one Android phone trying to play music. I expect a way to override and play music at the current location but that feature does not exist. I can't cast music half the time and the music just crashes and stops randomly. I expect more from a company like Apple. This product is embarrassing. I have seen better from highschool students.",
      "My past one year experience with app is not so good. Earlier I had a cheap android phone and this app used to lag a lot on it. But now that iam using a 1+ device it isn't as choppy as it is supposed to be. Apple is known for it's quality and if this is the quality that they are delivering, I think that Apple is overrated. If they cannot deliver their paid customers with a good quality app I don't know why they are even here on Android. It's a shame that that you guys cannot deliver even that.",
      "Great app, although, they have a habit of deleting albums and songs from their library which means they are no longer available & there have been a number of times I've searched for certain songs only to find they don't have them. I think that having to pay £9.99 a month you would think that the music selection would be nearly unlimited."

I think it's about time I start looking for another music player app.👎",
      "Would like to know what happened to your player controls widgit that allowed for play/pause and changing tracks? I have an older version on a different device (version 3.2.1) and that has the music player controls widgit. This latest version only has an equalizer widgit. Would love to be able to switch between tracks from my home screen again on my new device. Please add the music player controls widgit back!!! So sad to see you are not adding it back in.",
      "It's rare for me to rate apps, but now I think it's necessary because am using this app for how many years already and it didn't fail me so far here's my suggestion if you'd like to care haha😁 first, i hope we can put a live wallpaper on the background. Second, i wish we can modify the text all around like change it fonts, colors etc. And lastly, it will be more great if you notice me😁",

      "I've been using using SoundCloud for 10+ years and have been the jukebox for my family friends and co-workers since then 😇 Top music, plays in the background, minimal data usage, best playlists, stations tuned to your taste almost always guaranteed to add at least one choice song to your library a day. I have 1250 liked in the last 10 years. SoundCloud will forever be the best source of music to me. God bless you all in Jesus Christ name and may peace be with you. 🙏😇❤️❤️❤️",
      "soundclouds been good to me when it came to listening to anime openings and such, but recently every time i open the app it just closes down. immediately. if it doesnt immediately, then it does as soon as u play something. id like to listen to music here more but i guess not?? since the app doesnt even work???",
      "It's amazing u can stream a lot of music on here if u have ur favorite followed you get notified when they drop some new songs. But what I love mostly is the fun of discovering new completely unheard of artists. Though I rated it 4star the other star is it doesn't give you control of the songs you drop if you are an artist it doesn't give u control of your profile but overall it's an amazing App",
      "Intolerable lack of functionality. Cannot add or delete your own tracks from the app, can only be done from a pc!!! Now file browsers won't pick up soundcloud in sharing options, this thing is useless. Cannot manage your own music with it on the very device you're likely to part produce it. Can't even use the website on mobile to compensate. Tired of waiting for SoundCloud to listen to its users. Dumped as the annoyance it is. Ludicrous attitude to functionality. Ignorant, obdurate, and a fail.",
      "I've been using SoundCloud for 2 or 3 years now. Overall, it's been pretty good although I've noticed some changes over the years. Slowly there's been more ads added and more \"you need the unlimited version to listen to-\" when this app was, or what I originally thought, a way to listen to music 'free' Either way, it still works well and is useful. There's plently of artist on there that are up and coming, not to mention lots of covers. I'd recommend seeing that it's still technically free & good"

      "Constantly hijacks my BT on connection even with the proper settings. The play once feature needs to be on the play screen instead of buried in settings. See jetaudio for reference. UI looks very cartoonish. Again, reference jetaudio for comparison. Only two things going for it right now. CC support and Playlist support with Android 10. Response: none of my other audio apps have this issue. So regardless of what my car is doing, your app alone is broken. Pulsar, jetaudio, pandora...no issues.",
      "I've been using this app for 3 years and it remains to be the best music player in my opinion. However, the only issue is that for the last month the app will no longer download any missing artwork. And this is for popular music whose artwork would be easy to find. I have a subscription as well so any help with that would be much appreciated.",
      "I had a problem with double listing of playlists (which ended up being my fault). I received an unbelievable customer care response. Not only this player is fantastic...it also works perfectly with isyncher which allows seemless integration with iTunes to Android. Highly recommended !!!!",
      "Suuuuper Angry! 😡 When I played a song it showed a random picture from my phone in the background. Went to settings and selected that I wanted the picture file to be the one that corresponds to the mp3 file. Didn't change. Deleted that picture from my phone still didn't change. I selected \"IN THE APP\" to \"Reset Database\" to which it does warn that you will lose all playlists and song information. But it doesn't just delete from app it deleted from my entire phone!! ALL SONGS GONE FROM MY PHONE!",
      "By far the best music player for Android, and a note to any iTunes user; This is the only music player that can sort by 'album artist' and 'artist' in 2 seperate zones. Gets updates aswell which is good for any paid app."

      "Great experience... at first! I've played this game for years now, and I'd always enjoyed it. But now, the glitches are ridiculous and happen far too often. During any game, the game will throw a card for me which, many times, cost me the game. The game will even tell me I've been sitting out during the round while I'm still playing the game! It's beyond frustrating because this was one my favorite games. These glitches really need to be fixed asap!",
      "One of my pet peeve is the way that this game forces you to bet larger amounts than you may want to bet. Having thousands of tokens does not mean that I want to bet 50.000 per hand. It is clear why you do, the faster the tokens goes, hooefully the faster we will spend for more tokens...So annoying, but as a fool, I buy more tokens and so on and so forth.",
      "They got rid of the videos that actually pay a decent amount of coins, and now you're forced to watch videos after every game that they don't pay out coins for. It used to be a good game, but now it's just about getting you to spend money. Plus when you're stuck playing with the computer it makes the dumbest plays. DON'T DOWNLOAD!",
      "Change my mind, this game is awful, it use to be fun and exciting too much losing and the hands you get dealt is just horrible time after time and you can tell who the winner will be, it's the person who is losing from the start, the come back and winning is greater for the person losing, then the front runner who is ahead and dominating winning each hand until the last one or hands",
      "On more than one occasion, I've finished a game, put the phone down, and then watched the app start a game all by itself at the highest bid possible. It opens my screen and everything to just play itself. This has ran down my battery and heated my phone. I've literally tested this, and sure enough. Close the app. I was thinking about supporting you guys..definitely not getting a penny of my money now. Rather a 5-Star rating just fell to 1. To your response: 2 Updates later, it still does this"

      "What a great educational app! My 9 year old with Autism loves this app. He was using it on his class and loved it so much we bought it for home use. It's totally worth the money.

      "As a teacher, I use this with my students and my 2 year old. Very good price and good for early learners, on going practice and remediation.",
      "A very useful app, helps kids to learn essential skills for reading and making mathematical processes. I recommend it.",
      "We've used starfall for about 5 years now. My daughter learned to read using this program and she still uses it, thanks to the extra grades added, as extra study in our homeschool. My preschooler is using it along with our homeschool studies and loves to sing along with the vowel songs. Hopefully he'll be reading soon too. This is such an excellent program. I love the convenience of the app, but love that I can print worksheets to go along with what we're focusing on as well. Thank you Starfall!"

      "The best at all amongst all other players that are available on the Google play store in terms of performance, UI, them, visualizer, customizing options, beautiful animations, very elegant,  It feels so much better, But one only thing that I didn't love is that it can't change and song or album info although the option of change tags is available but It doesn't work, it seems working on it self I mean u can see the changes only in powerramp but u can't see that in other apps Which's not good",
      "Please add the A-B repeat option. That's the only thing that this app needs. I cannot explain the how good is this app in words because there are so many of them. The first app on Google Play which I bought. Because this app just suite my usage and option I am looking for and the price is also too reasonable and low.",
      "INCONSISTENT. They're constantly changing the settings (for the worse). Has way TOO MANY options, & most don't work properly. Paid for this years ago, & used to love it. Has gotten progressively worse, & I'm FED UP with having to reconfigure the player every time, to simply play my f%@#!n music. UPDATE 3/7/20: Now that I left a bad review, player mysteriously deleted 1/2 of my 4500 mp3s before I shut my phone off to stop it. Thank God I have them backed up on my computer. F.U. PowerAmp !!!",
      "The OG...been using power amp since the 90's, still great! Bought the app for my first smart phone and have been getting massive amounts of use from it since, feels kinda cheap on my end honestly, I spent $4 like 15 years ago and this is still my favorite music app and it will be yours too once you get used to it, very powerful player with huge amounts of options and deep control. Huge fan of the app and the company, you won't regret use this and like me you'll end up buying it eventually!",
      "Before the forced Android 10 update from AT&T this app worked fine on my Note 9. Now, however, every time I plug my phone into a TV (using a HDMI connection) the player just starts playing automatically at full volume. It is totally annoying. I have the poweramp paid version. Also I have the poweramp widget on my home screen. After you fix this, I will change my review from 3 to 5 stars."

      "Nice but very pricey! Is it worth $54 a month? Let's see, there are commercials throughout the movies. Playback on week old sitcoms like American Idol are loaded with ads that you are not allowed to skip! The cool thing are all the available movies, old shows, new shows, live entertainment, oh wait, there are TV apps that do the same thing BUT THEY ARE FREE!!!",
      "I love this app! We are able to look up movies and tv shows and add them to our list so easily. If we want to catch up on our shows, no problem. They have them. The only thing is I wish it was less in cost. When I first signed up it was a really good deal. They then added more channels and went up on their price because of that. Unstandble, but I wasnt given the choice if I wanted the new channels and the price increase. So, to help with cost, I have to go back to cable. Not what I wanted.",
      "Hands down best streaming app out there!! We had sling TV first, then tried Philo TV. Then went back to sling TV. We were not happy with sling TV because they have too many issues to get worked out. Too many glitches. Since we got YouTube TV we could not be more satisfied. No glitches at all!! We like having a regular guide to pull up to see what we want to watch, YouTube TV has that. We cut the cord and haven't been happy until we got YouTube tv!!!!! Need more space to write. We love it!!!!!!!!",
      "Decent service for the money but way too many sports channels. At least we get local news channels, unlike HULU, which gave us news channels based on our wifi location not our physical location. Only other drawback is that when you delete a recording it doesn't remove it from your list until 9 months after the record date. Definitely beats paying the high price of cable.",
      "Not a great service. It held lots of promise, on which YouTube has fallen short. Overall,not a great interface. Then, when you find something and it happens to be not subscribed from your local area, you get way to many ads, often for the same product (using exactly the same as), in the same commerical break segment. I tried it for almost a year, and I'm cancelling it. Don't waste your money on YouTube TV."

I'll gladly pay before experiencing that. byyyyyye",
      "Love the layout, it's visually pleasing and easy to use. For those that say it shuts off periodically, it might just be that the app is set as put to sleep in your phone because it was using too much battery, don't believe it's the apps fault.",
      "this player is the best I've used in features and looks I can't rearly see what else you would want in a player it does just about everything thats needed.EDIT Have bought the add free version and now includes the lyrics after latest updates it can't be bettered. EDIT 2 this app just gets better, new layout even more pro looking along with new look lyrics, nice work DEVS",
      "Ads pop up, very awkward to use while driving, the old app was simpler. Would be a good app otherwise gonna find something without ads... Also it took 1 album art and applied it to loads of songs. I wouldn't mind but the album art is bad so I dont like that",
      "The player is quite good but sometimes it stops working and plays the different song automatically and there are not such good player themes. According to me here are are some areas to improve . But all over it's quite good."

      "Here's how you really got to play this game. In the tutorial don't start your village. You can wonder around in the village they show you at the intro. Great way to understand that building is limitless. So after falling down their well. You can start your village. But don't buy anything yet. The game allows you to build with unlimited blocks, until you buy your first building. Wait till you get your building experience down then buy. And you can get 500 gems for free. Happy Building",
      "I like the app .I am really writing this to complain about the villagers,they are SUPER ANNOYING I can't build anything without them getting in the way! I built a big house but its empty, all because I cant put things in it without them teleporting in to my house!!!! Most of my village they can go to but there are like 2 building that are private wich are my house and my pool. They already have there own pool! So I went FAR but there still teleporting there. Take there teleporting ability away!",
      "I really love this game! It's just like Minecraft but a little different. But I have some things I wish would be in the game... First of all, can there be like a daily reward? I wish that would happen.. I'm really broke. Secondly, I would recommend gaining XP while your in the game, you can only get XP when you are building something from the workshop, and you need gems to buy them. How are you going to get gems if your broke? Well, there is the Free Gems thing but it only gives you 2 gems.",
      "This game is really fun!!! You get to build whatever you want... on level three you only have 150 of every block and the animals and stuff you have to buy them with your gems. If you want to build something big and you run out of blocks you ethier have to watch a video of use your gems.",
      "The experience is great. You don't only build your own city but you can build what you please! Most tell you to make your own world how you would like but, How do you do that without showing you how to play? This doesn't only do that but Even after it they put up a guide to build. I Just press the house until I'm done. You can do that to because if you have a different block then what you put down it Puts down the correct one on your build. This was a great alternative to Minecraft. Thx!!! 💓💓"

      "It is a really great game but sometimes the game glitches and stops so i have to reset the whole phone, but that is probably my phone and not the game, who knows, but overall the game is really great and fun.",
      "It is a good game. People freak out you can only access the game for 3 days. Which isn't true. If you freak out that you can't access anything (when you can, you unlock a place each day) know that these are ALL the games that are $2.99 per game. This game is actually perfect if you have VIP as you don't need to buy the rest of the games. It's basically free if you buy it for a month instead. All the games would be 50-100 dollars all to buy. The game has a problem it freezes and kicks me out tho.",
      "Not working just want to play on my own not small town and everything is locked in the game fix it my parents don't want to spend money for this game.☠️Also every time i play it every thing restarts and sends me back to my home screen...😞😠😠😠😡😡😡😈😈😈😈👿👿👿",
      "I think this app is great for young kids . It helps their developing mind figure out what to do in a situation. Even though it is basically a video game I don't really mind as long as my kids are away from me . I suggest downloading all the My Town games. It might also help their communication skills. It is nice when your kids are away from you and being quiet. It is my favourite game I ever decided to download for my kids. I really recommend this game to you. I also recommend Toca games they are really alike My Town. Thank You for taking your time to read this",
      "It was a really good game but thean it starded gliching.😡 I can get not in to the house, and the game will not evan load properly the guy walkinng his dog at the top of the loading screen just stops and gliches the app is optimezd for my divice and instaled no probablem what is going on?!

      "Honestly, it's a good game that I have always enjoyed in the past. My thing is that I don't recall there ever being this many ads before. I'm not faulting this game for trying to make money with ad revenue but I am faulting how they've implemented it. I noticed that there is now an option to watch an ad and get a hint. My problem lays in that I will get unskippable 30 sec ads after I complete a puzzle with out touching the option for watching a video to get a hint. It takes away from the game.",
      "At first when my daughter introduced me to Free Flow, I must admit, I was reluctant. However, after watching how much she was enjoying the game, I became curious. Needless to say, at this point, it has become my favorite game. I am 71yrs old and I've been playing for quite some time now. By the way, I had accumulated over 440 hints which disappeared overnight. What happened?",
      "A really good puzzle game that I have spent many hrs playing, so good that I paid for the extra levels and I don't normally pay for anything extra, I have played the other Flow Free games and enjoyed them too and I like the challenge as the levels get harder and would recommend this to anyone who's searching for a really good puzzle game 👍",
      "Game is wonderful... My only concern with it is that most of these levels are WAYYY too easy... Even the \"beginner\" levels should be slightly more challenging.... Or you should give the player the option to replay the levels but on a harder difficulty, just a idea for the future... But as someone who loves puzzels like these ones i would like it to be more challenging",
      "Did rate it 5* but recently they've added a ridiculous number of long unskippable ads - they're every 3 games or so, which is usually less than a minute! Was such a good game but it's basically unplayable now :( EDIT: Seem to have stopped the unskippable ads again so back to 5*! Seriously addictive game, challenging enough to be interesting without being so hard it's frustrating!"

      "After reading lot of negative reviews, I waited to try this out. But it all changed when Google gave 3 mo free to chromecast users. Still I was a bit skeptical and tried it on my laptop and phone with xbox controller. It worked so well that I got a stadia controller and that's the best decision I made. I agree that not all features that were promised are available at launch, but this works like a charm. I played Metro, Destiny, RDR II and I never had a drop in framerate. I love it.",
      "I am an owner of a PS4 and Xbox One, but providing Stadia can get Next gen games (excluding platform exclusives) then Stadia is going to be my go to console. When playing over my WiFi Stadia runs so well that you would think I was playing it directly from a console and I like being able to play on pretty much any screen / device I own. Yes there isn't a massive games library, and most are old games, but I think Stadia can be the future of gaming and stop me from upgrading to next gen.",
      "App works, but gameplay isn't working well consistently. Audio clipping, frame drops, random freezing and controller lag make it very stressful to use. This occurs most of the time (80% for me). If it starts with issues, it continues. If it starts without issues, it'll still experience issues, but issues will happen rarely.",
      "Would be super cool to even try this,but I'm not buying a 100$ controller just to play, I have ps4 xbox and 8bitdo that work for my xbox cloud and geforce accounts.....I guess I'll keep using those since google doesnt want to let me buy games through their weird hidden service yet? Huh, oh well , take my money geforce",
      "The app works fine for the functionality included in the app, but it's also very barebones and needs a lot of attention from Google. Ingame screenshots are available in the app, but only to view on the mobile device and delete; I can't export these for sharing. There's also no search function for games in the store, forcing one to slog through all the games manually to find what they want."

      "Why did you change the UI so that you have to scroll through mazes one at a time? I LOVE the UI's graphically, but having to scroll through every maze one by one is awful! Go back to the grid view for mazes, but keep the graphical design of the new UI! And for the people who prefer the old UI's graphical design, let us choose between the old UI's graphics and the new UI's graphics. That way EVERYONE will be happy!",
      "The game use to be fun, been playing for 40 years, but every since they changed for 40th anniversary it sucks. Takes forever to open, freeze when you want to watch a free commercial none available but change board and have to watch one for a few seconds before can close, I wish they'd go back to 39 year game, and another thing use to be quicker to find game you want to play now have to swipe many times to find the game you want, really sucks",
      "Good better than. Original BUT... IN-BETWEEN mazes I need that screen to respond to my joystick. As it stands my joystick plays the mazes perfectly but it can't \"press\" button to continue. The focus is no where on transition screen. IDEA? maybe have a separate app for players to design their own mazes to share with others? This could bring back Pacman. Also have various other monsters other than ghosts? Like a slow moving frog that burps fire flies and they Chase player??? Just an idea.",
      "PAC-MAN the way it should've been played upon it's very first release onto Arcades Cabinets everywhere 40 yrs ago now lol I love the ability to play Classic PAC-MAN (I can't believe this title has 256 Stages) I especially enjoy the Mazes and how each one is so unique and different from the next and to make this game even cooler then it already is, it has Tournaments to see how you stack up against other players online, throughout randomized generated maps. Great Remake of a Great Classic! Thx B!",
      "I have been playing Pac - Man for many years now but only after they updated the system for their anniversary, it just doesn't work properly and is soooo slow. I would have given this same a better rating but the changes made to the game stop me."

      "No recognition of all folders on the SD card. It seems to be blind while other apps can find them fine. Galaxy note 9.",
      "The best so far. 5 Stars, l like the way it explores every video folder on my gadget and external storage installed on it. Thanks alot.",
      "I needed something to watch avi videos from my trail cams. Works good. Get a little ad that you have to close every so often but no big deal just close it and keep watching your vids.",
      "Why a three star? For the interruption for rate me now when it has only been a few times. Maybe if I didn't get interrupted probably would of gotten a Five rate."

      "Best music player ever, cool design, great sound & awesome features. Registered with a monthly subscription from the first 2 minutes of usage. You can delete files from within the app, music loads fast, browsing and sorting is intuitive. The only negative thing I found: it looses star ratings after you move the rated files around, so it must have its own database for storing the ratings instead of appending them to the file. All in all great app.",
      "Well it's a great app and everything else but it needs to be updated for the new Android updates and it should read all the music to your phone because I have a 256gb SD card and dont read helf the music from micro sd at all that issue needs fixed",
      "It would be an awesome app and get 5 stars from me if the equalizer worked like it should. From when I first installed the app equalizer worked fine until 2nd song started and then it started sounding like equalizer off but says its on. After trying to make adjustments to no avail, I had to exit out of app and then open again...equalizer will work through maybe a couple songs and then just turn off or stop working. Fix this please cuz it's a great music player...and too many ads also. Thanks.",
      "Overall a good app. However when used in parallel with Runtastic app, the player often stops playing music after the Runtastic gives audio comments. And there is no obvious pattern when it happens: we are talking about Runtastic comments that come after every kilometer of running is completed - sometime the player stops after 5km, sometimes after 7-8km, and almost always it stops at 12km and continues to do so every following kilometer. Very unpleasant and distracts from sport as the music has to be restarted so often. Same on Android 4 or 5 and 9.",
      "I was looking for a music player app that would work on a android tablet that could simulate a car stereo interface. NRG is the closest that I have found so far. My only wish is that I could have the option, in landscape mode,of just seeing the current song playing. I am still planning on purchasing this app because the buttons are large and the ease of the ability to change playlist while driving."

      "I have a 3rd gen Chromecast that up until the recent update worked perfectly. Now I can't cast any device at all. Google home allows me to set up the device, but then it says to me that the room is offline. When clearly it is not since google chrome is casting stock photos on my tv. Please help! I have already reached out to the google .support community pages and the advice I get is to do a factory reset. I've done that several times and still get this error. please help asap",
      "I have the Google home mini and I love it. It was really easy to set up with this app. The Google Home mini is awesome! I really appreciate that (unlike the echo dot) it never goes off on a tirade of useless information completely unprompted; and when asked anything, it always replies with the appropriate/accurate response. The apps user interface for setup is extremely easy. It pretty much does everything for you. After that though, I found navigation within the app somewhat convoluted.",
      "Great when it works frustrating when it doesn't. Creating routines and using commands is great but every now and then Google will make a tweak causing \"x\" command to stop working. For instance I used to be able to say lock front door and now it's confused not knowing which device I want to use. Previously it was asking to \"play thumbs up playlist\" on Google music and I've since had to modify it to say \"play my ...\" All these changes but no notification as to what changed",
      "This app is great to turn off lights or broadcast from any room or even from a car or train. Google devs please remember that users will access this via a Touchscreen not just voice and update the app so the rooms can be filtered from a drop down list. At the moment I have to scroll forever to get to a room at the bottom of this list. I'm not going to say 'hey google' on a train full of people. Please put a filter at the top.",
      "I'm honestly wondering what Google is doing with this app. Firstly, no other choice of video call then Duo and it's not accessible if you do not want to link a phone number. Now I am figuring out that casting Iheart Radio does not work either....it seems that this option is not available in Canada.....wow...why?"

      "As i was playing on happy meal app i know it was taking my spot of scaning my toy! I was so so so so so so so... (150 years later!) MAD!! But i like this app!",
      "I LIKE it but I saw more games on the pictures and I Didn't see it on the app but I wish you could put the games that are in the picture on the app.",
      "I think you have to scan the happy meal box instead of the toy. I personally love the paint brush game. The one from scanning the toy really had nothing to with it (they have Pokemon toys and the game could have been for anything). It would be nice if the game promoted the series of toys more. I haven't tried out everything yet and i probably won't, but it seems great for kids."

      "The cue ball and the force bar do not work properly. Some other party is maybe controlling them. Some times I have made the shot but it gets glitched and then says that you ran out of time. Miniclip must do something on the crashes. I have played two games a moment ago. I have not played even any shot, suddenly it crashed and again started connecting and after connecting the I cannot see the game which I was playing. My coins were reduced. I cannot define everything in this post. It's critical.",
      "I love this game. It is fun to play with everyone i can play with. The only thing i have a problem with is the rapid fire timer. Youre supposed to get more time added when ever you hit a ball in but only 3 seconds? Ive been down to 1 second and hit one in and it was like i didnt get any extra time. Also how come when there is no ad so i can have an extra 20 seconds and my turn evds but when i hit retry it goes into an ad?",
      "8 ball pool is fun, easy to learn, and hard to master. My only gripe is the chat interface could a lounge area for ppl to just chat, or an option to pause the game to chat more. Great App! some suggestions for chat boxes: 'you got this' , 'how the felt did that happen?' , ' you have a high eye cue ' and the ever popular 'put some mustard on that!' :)",
      "The more you play you'll realize you' re not playing against people but against the game and the game will decide if you win or lose. You'll find you start losing more making you want to upgrade and buy more cash, coins and better cues. There's no end.... 3 days later I haven't won a game since @ level 19....go figure. I'm done with it.",
      "You people can't keep your scores right. how can I be leading by difference of two and the next game the scores will be changed to the person rather leading. This has happened to me more than a single time if you can't keep the right scores then there's no need to be showing it to us. Also the person you will be playing with will be seeing something different from what you are seeing. Kindly work on this because we all boast about knowing how to play."

Literally 5 minutes work, useless.",

      "9/26/2019 - App is slow. I just timed it. Time I tapped on the icon to the time keyboard appeared: **12 seconds** It shows you two ads that are hard to get rid of. The final straw was yesterday, when they sent a spam notification asking you to use the app. 1/21/2020 - Can't figure out how to try keyboard for free, without purchasing a subscription with credit card. There's a free three day trial, but I don't want to deal with hassle of canceling.",

I'm a music student trying to use this to find my key to play the melody I'm trying to sing on this small keyboard and this app is terrible for that. get add Everytime I reopen the app. their strategy is to annoy into buying the ad free version. and the price is so bad, what am I paying for then if it's free. don't get if annoyed by ads",

      "Web Video Caster is the best app for casting to your tv. It efficiently takes care of all the annoying pop up ads. It is very user friendly and has loads of extra features and setting choices. The customer service is second to none. Response is usually within half hour (even on holidays) and your issue is either resolved immediately or they work with you to get it resolved. Great job across the board!! I highly recommend purchasing this app.",
      "I gave this a 1 star earlier and want to revise my experience... I was immediately contacted by their support team who walked me through a step by step process to get it working. I realize I had the wrong expectation. I wanted phone mirroring, which is not what this is. This app allows casting apps or web based sites to cast via WiFi to your smart TV/Roku like device. Still somewhat complicated, but they were very accommodating.",
      "The free version has worked great for my dlna streaming. I definitely will be supporting the developer in purchasing the premium version. I've tried my factory version, several options available through the app store and even a few apk options not available here. Finally tried this one on accident and it has worked for every format I've tried. I haven't even had to change my phone's battery optimization settings. My search is finally over. The ads aren't an issue at all.",
      "**Issue appears to just be me, Devs are really helpful in trying to figure out why it's happening. Thank you** I love this app but recently I keep encountering video server errors with some websites that tend to have a lot of popups (some that are infested with them are fine, oddly enough). Though I disabled all adblocking options, cleared the cache and it still happens. Doesn't happen on browsers like Chrome and Rocketshield's Adblocker Browser. One example is 9anime.to, please fix this",
      "Great app! Works better than expected! Also 'seems' to use less wifi signal than PS4 for watching youtube and internet videos. Before using this app, my ps4 was VERY laggy to the point it was unwatchable. Now the signal goes through my phone straight to my tv. Im so happy I found an app thats works as it should! A great purchase! Definite keeper!"

      "I like the constant updates. And they come just when I'm having problems. The products are operating good. The issue is when you bring in your second account and it is an account with a different telecom company, mine is outlook, seems like there must be a better way for the network to understand you're the same person. That is my wish list, everything Gboard, Gmail, Assistant, work great, the assistant recognizes one me and two accounts with no problem.",
      "Everything was working fine for years, until latest update. The problem now is that I can't open PDF files. It's freezing and get a black screen. 12-03-2020 I have uninstalled the latest update and everything works fine. Installed again the latest update and nothing is working. I can not access Drive files and can not open PDF files. Please fix it. Thanks",
      "It was a nice app but recently the synchronization has been an issue. Now I open it then it crashes and says \"Synchronization error\". I have updated and still the same. I can not click on the link to access the link you sent me. Please sort this out urgently and I will change the rate to 5. Answer my comments with why this is happening so all people can see. Not privately. Still the same problem & now I open a new account & there no folders. When I try to delete an acc, says I need my admin....",
      "App was good at one time. It seems like the last year have been nothing but problems. It seems like the more you use it the glitchier it becomes. When using it in the first few minutes it might be fine then after a little while I will get duplicates of the same video which aren't really duplicates at all and if you delete them thinking it's a duplicate your actually deleting something else and it's probably something you really want to keep. Thank goodness the trash has never let me down.",
      "I love using Google drive to store a lot of PDFs and different files to access whenever I need them. Now there is a version management, that uploads a new version of a PDF whenever I just want to look up a page for one minute in Adobe Acrobat, which prevents me from opening a file for a couple of minutes and it KEEPS BREAKING THINGS! I have a dozen or so PDFs where I have to delete all the useless and corrupted versions (on PC, doesn't work on mobile) to even be able to open them again. Pls fix!"

      "I loved the game and then multiplayer happened. There are serious issues with the multiplayer mode. I dont know if there are hacks going on or not, but I have hit others over and over again with shells and other items, and while in frenzy, and the other racers just keep on going. Meanwhile, I get hit once, and I'm knocked out. It's happening almost every single race. Also, I've come in first place, yet when the results come in, I'm in 2nd, 3rd, etc... Fix these issues.",
      "A few days ago, I was able to start racing in the Ludwig cup in the Baby Rosalina tour. Ever since, the app only loads up the first two races in the cup, so I'm completely unable to even see the last race and the bonus, seeming as if they don't exist. If I reset the app, I will lose all of my progress, so there's nothing I can do. I tried to send this to customer support within the app and got told to \"try again later\". How am I supposed to play the game when the races don't load up???",
      "This game was awesome when I first got it. I even bought the monthly subscription. An update came and all of a sudden you have to be a professional gamer to win at 150cc and above, or the new multiplayer option. Some days even 100cc is frustrating as hell. It makes you want to throw your phone at the wall when every 10 seconds you get hit by something and crash. I wish I could go back to before the update. I would restart my subscription if that happened.",
      "Was fun until they added multiplayer. I've been having fun with the game for a while but I started doing multiplayer races and it's stupid. Every round I've played has to be full of hackers or something. I'll use an item on someone. It registers as a hit but they dont spin out. Just keep driving. And one time I played a match and someone was somehow just spamming bombs THE ENTIRE TIME. Can you please make a way to report players who are cheating.",
      "Won't start. Loads to 15% then error 806-9090. Cleared cache reinstalled, same thing. Will change review if fixed later. For now I'm going to go be sad because I was looking forward to some Mario Kart. Update 3/17/20:. Was able to install and having a great time with it. Steering is not the same as it used to be, but it's fun once you get used to it."

      "A very feature rich player. It has everything one may look for in a video player. However, there's one thing I didn't like is that the UI and purple accent everywhere. Please make UI more visually appealing with options to customise and a library system for video player which shows files with meta data and tags like Netflix. I know that is way over the top one actually look for, but this would make it the best and only player with such features.",
      "This is just ok..video settings by this app is amazing& appreciable👏 but we have to adjust settings for every time in some aspects... Lot of improvements needed.. \"remember settings\" feature should be included..and manual brightness without depending on system brightness should also be included.. If so.. It will deserve better ratings..",
      "New version is really bad. Please go back to previous version. I can't move forward more than 24 seconds when I swipe right. When the play bar is on I can't move forward or backward at all. \"All video\" page is a disaster since the clips that I download in Whatsapp or Telegram are shown in there. Exiting the video is so much harder now. KMPlayer is still the best on any platform so fix these problems please!",
      "Love everything about KMplayer! Although, I did discover a minor issue. Player would not play a couple of my AVI movie files. It did play my other AVI files. Also would not play a DIVX movie file. Not a big deal I use another player for those files. Other than that, you guys did a FANTASTIC job with this video player! Thank you!!!!",
      "I've found and used so many video player apps but this player make me so amazing. Adding substitle (especially ass file) into a video made me crazy when I used the old apps but this app can do that easily and quickly with a lot of features and I like that. Everything is good until now."

      "Currently there is a bug where the app will crash if you try and sign in to your cable provider, which is obviously a big problem. Some other minor issues are a UI which is poorly optimized for anything outside of 16:9 and a lack of an option to pay to remove ads, and you've got yourself a bit of a stinker honestly. This would normally deserve 3 stars but the bug is worth docking an extra one since that's major functionality.",
      "This app is amazing, like if you dont have a tv provider sure it might suck, but if you do have a tv provider then you get to unlock all episodes of whatever show is on cartoon network. If you dont speak english there is a way you can put in your language. 5 star!",
      "HORRIBLE! ABSOLUTE TRASH! only gives you like 2 episodes for each show. The ones that ARE unlocked are in the middle of the season! When I try to log in, the app crashes! Tried to log into it on my Roku tv, but after I completed the online activation, it still didn't log in! DONT INSTALL THIS APP! IT IS AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF STORAGE!",
      "There are pros and cons. pros: the shows are pretty fun and cool. you can't always watch them on other apps. cons: it usually malfunctions and it's REALLY frustrating. And it takes such a long time to log in! and it's confusing and annoying.",
      "The reason I'm so upset with the carts of Nick word app is because what if you do not have a TV provider, it doesn't give you an option to say, you know English or anything. That is my problem. They could probably do that if they say the app is for free"

      "This app is sooooooo bad! It doesn't even let you start the program without paying. And it's 90 bucks a month. That is so UNREASONABLE and STUPID. I would never pay that much for a game. Plus I wouldn't even know if what I was paying for because they don't let you see the program before you have to pay. NO WAY I'm DELETING this RIGHT NOW. BYE BYE. If I could rate 0 stars I would.",
      "The tiles don't respond well, which makes the game incredibly hard (It was already had without that problem). Plus could you explain me why you have to pay to play national anthems, unless it's the Russian or American one??? I'm French and English, I was so pissed to see I have to pay almost 80 bucks for my two NATIONAL ANTHEMS? The idea was great, but these problems makes it the worst music game ever. Uninstalled in less than 20 minutes.",
      "As a music lover and a person who plays rhythm games like Guitar Hero and the like, learn from the guys whose formula works. Your game is enjoyable, yes. But the way you've built the system for this game is just going to throw a player's timing off. Either you play a clicker for a player to sync the timing with for the notes, or play the accompaniment to the notes so that a player has something to base their timing on and not just the keys hitting the line. Each player will have a version of a song's speed they may play the notes in their head with, so your formula will not work. You need to provide a basis for the player. A clicker or accompaniment to the notes. And forget about pausing at the notes if a player misses it. That throws off timing as well. If the player misses it, so be it. A player will try again to get the note's timing correct. That's what a rhythm game is.",
      "Terrible game in most aspects. It doesn't even start before showing you an option to purchase, with the button already set to \"buy\", trying to get you in an expensive as hell subscription of something you didn't even try. It doesn't have an exit for this semi-scam, so eother you accept, spend 5 minutes trying to enter, or restart the app. The game looks ok, but the tiles are terrible. For a musical game, the indication marks are HORRIBLY out of sync. Not recommending this one AT ALL."

      "This is how you make a game that I will actually keep on my phone. No intrusive, strange permissions. No \"BUY NOW\" in my face all the time. The actual game is even fun and addictive. I would play more, but energy tickets are a bit of a *bleh* thing to deal with. Still, I can accept that, being as I did not have to sit through a single ad that I did not initiate (I have watched the ads for tickets when I chose to do so). VERY NICE!!! I probably won't mind spending $$$ here if this keeps up! :)",
      "Very fun and addicting game. Lots of other challenges besides just getting bingos. I like that it doesn't cost alot of coins for the boosters. I would've gave it 5 stars but it won't let me enter my player name or my email address. I'd like to be able to change my player name but when I push \"ok\" or \"done\", it just takes me back to the \"watch ads\" screen. It's very fustrating..",
      "This is my favorite Bingo game out there. Its fair to us, giving us coins to by boosters, tickets to play, chests to open with everything we need inside. It has no limitations. Thanks to the developers who made it possible, I appreciate what you have created. I play it constantly. Also love the avatars that we earn and daubers which we earn also, and all of the color changes for both. It makes us independent!",
      "My all-time favorite bingo game BUT I'm questioning the \"random\" odds. I have 2 completed sets of stamps waiting on 1 stamp to complete the set and earn the ticket rewards. I've been waiting WEEKS for one stamp. I actually quit playing for awhile out of frustration. I have given it another shot but still no luck. I have collected 932 stamps on this one series alone waiting on ONE STAMP. That's ridiculous in my opinion. How is that possible? Beyond frustrating! I may quit a second time for good.",
      "Its a good pass time but its so Difficult to get a bingo. Usually if 1 more number is needed to get a bingo and there are 14 to 15 more winners left, that number rarely gets called out. The stamps will all get completed but that 1 piece will frustrate you so much to complete the last stamp that you will keep on loosing tkts and you wont get it. My luck could be bad sometimes but not always. Its more annoying than entertaining. I am finally uninstalling."

      "The game is actually my favorite game. Normally this would get 5 stars and more if I could. But the customer service is what changed my mind. I play this game, a lot.... I mean A LOT and yes, I actually spend my real money on it. On Friday, I paid 3.99 for the coin bank and was charged and never get the coins. I reached out to customer service not once, not twice but 3 times and no response, not even an automated one. Yes I love the game but taking my money is a huge game changer.",
      "I think the game is just great, its fun to play with your friends in 2v2 or in a room. Its even a good way to make friends on the game and play with them. The only downside of the game is when someone plays a plus two, and you also have something to stack. It should be made to where you can choose to just draw two instead of playing something",
      "Money Trap... It is impossible to win grand prix... You just can't win... And you have to pay 10 diamonds for entrance fee. And guess what, after couple of games you have to pay real money to get more diamonds. I literally tried at least 30 times but not won a single grand prix! There are bots and algorithms in game to just keep you losing...",
      "Game itself is fine, but don't like the way the coins function works. I feel like you should have the option to Free Play where you don't earn or use coins, so it's just for fun. Honestly it kind of rubs me the wrong way how the only way to play a match is basically gambling, especially if you end up having to spend real money to replenish coins.",
      "It's my favourite game, but i'm having a problem that had happened to me 5 times in 2 days. It's the question when they drop +4 and the question was: does the player have a blue card? And i said no. Then when it came his time to play he dropped the only card he had yellow. Game is bugy fix your game! Right now it's the badest game i've played."
