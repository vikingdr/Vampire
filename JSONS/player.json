      "this used to be the best video player on android. It still is but the ads haunt me now. I understand that showing ads is primary source of income for the developers but your ads are too agressive. please try to improve on this segment. Also update the pro version with additional features like regular one. Its just too outdated that it makes no sense buying the pro version.",
      "While playing games the application is freezing and leads to loss the game where in online or in offline. Please fix this issue. And other thing while playing games there is a 2nd chance for playing the game after watching ads but now it isn't available and unable to beat the score and it been difficult to play...,..... Sometimes I think to quit from games. Please don't make and encourage this type of fricky experiments",
      "App is fully scrap, worthless, fully garbage, always showing ads, irrelevant content to users as the users are not interested in those scrap. Every time tapping to new contant it show the ads, once displayed it takes lot of time to restart the content and very frequent ads. MX player will you state that what is the upper extent of spaming, as you are crossing the limit. In now a days very more apps are available and you are behaving like the dominating one in terms of ads content. Garbage App",
      "Good Player but too many ad. I normally watch \"Crime Satark\". Before ad and after ad you get buffering. Many a times after the ad the serial don't start at all. If I exit from the app & try to reconnect again I get same ad and then after buffering. Due to which compulsorily you can't watch the serial as it don't start at all.",
      "Have been using this for years and is a excellent app that plays most video formats and files. I will now be deleting it and trying to find a alternative as all I want is a player that is lightweight and plays LOCAL videos. I do not want notifications of online videos or push feeds, there are plenty of other apps / players for that. It is evolving...into making more money. Shame."

Definitely recommend this to anyone & can't wait to see what else you do with it. Great work, Thank you!!!",

When connected to a Bluetooth headset (Sennheiser HD 4.40BT) I find some latency between the audio and video in this app. Things work perfectly in YouTube and MXPlayer so I don't think it's a hardware problem. Would be great if that could be fixed.",
      "I have been using it for a couple of years its the best both Vedeo and music player.One day when i tried to a make a music play list it suddenly dinied me access and stopped functioning i tried to clear data and force to stop openned the app same issue ,,i just could not rate 5starts unless the problem is fixed...am waiting for your update and big time i uninstalled it several times the app is showing me same promblem of closing itself when i Make a playlist.,...i dont knw why ?!!",

Yes, it doesn't matter what video you are watching it occurs constantly. Everything you said I type it, I even restarted my phone from factory and, still had issues with it,",
      "I love this app so much that I kept it for 9 months now, can I recommend some changes to the home for some more exciting designs or textures. Still the best video player app I have ever used.. If your asking me for a better video player app, I totally recommend this app for you!"

      "The new updates are terrible. They make the product almost completely unusable compared to previous versions. It should not take 10 seconds or more to load a playlist, and I don't care how many tracks there are on the playlist. Playlists linger after I have tried to delete them. The only thing the updates have fixed is blank playlists showing up. That's still simply not good enough if the trade off is an app that lags so much you're considering using the crappy pre-installed app. Nonsense.",
      "Dysfunctional, Frustrating! Lame Settings. Paused video disonnects casting and begins playing on my tablet at a random time or another video! Timeline repeatedly vanishes and makes resuming video at select points frustrating and embarrassing (audiences). Highly over rated app. Does not play well on my Samsung tablet. Okay to watch a non-stop video but stop and go doesn't conform to a pleasant experience. Nothing like the computer version. Icon signifies that you should avoid this half baked app.",
      "I really love this app, I've been using it for a good 6 years now downloading it on every new phone I bought. Love the playback speed option, the ability to slow music tempo and keep the same tone of the song is a very nice feature, I just wish it kept the sound quality too. Other than that..its a very great app VLC",
      "Resize options are all the same aspect ratio, showing the same vertically stretched picture for lots of videos, except 3:4 which is not helping . Most 4K videos, mkv, gets stretched. HD movies also get stretched if I use another player, like YouYube, and then go back to VLC. Only way to fix it is to restart the box. That only fix HD though. Tried reinstalling, but no luck. It refuses to show black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Box is MINIX U1",
      "I love VLC. Had it for years on my PC. On the phone Ive stuck with it while it develops and improves. My only problems on the phone are two things. Firstly the auto volume reduction when it thinks the vol is too high. It would be great to disable this. Why ? Because I dont just feed it to headphones. I play back through a Hifi system and its annoying it randomly reduces the volume withiut warning. Two. The auto scrolling of file titles. Really, really annoying when they are long !!!!"

      "Itd be nice if it were possible to fast forward by pressing a button, not just skip to next song. You should also make it possible to add cover art for the album by searching for it within the player so you dont have to switch between the internet and the app. Same thing for the lyrics. Theres times when i go to edit the details of a song and after changing and saving them, the music player shows the song with the wrong information still.",
      "I downloaded this app as an alternative to my previous MP3 music player due to loss of privacy with the last App. However, this App works just as well, if not better as the last App, (Audify Music Player, for those wondering.) and I highly recommend the download! Navigating the App is simple, organizing songs is a breeze, functionality is great, all in all, a winner in my book.",
      "Adds... more bothersome than in my previous app which presumably spied on me. Taggs are not working, or rather it worked once until it gave up on me. Cant give more than 3 stars since i just downloaded it. Minus side also is that it doesnt recognize audio books (feature that i miss). Are there any positive things? At does seem to work. Themes and appearance looks better.",
      "Aside from a few bugs I really love this app! I found that when I go to my artists tab and sort by ascending, it only shows a few artists, although when I sort by descending it shows all of them, but I don't like sorting by descending :/ Still sorting by artist, the preview screen that shows all the artists also inaccurately displays how many songs or albums I have by the artist, and when I click on the artist, then it shows me a completely different amount, although at least it's accurate then.",
      "An amazing app no anoying ads, does everything it's supposed to, and background play. If I could rate more than 5 I would, this is a really good app. 👍 Edit: When trying to put lyrics in with copy and paste for a specific song it wouldn't work, and I know it's not because I copied and pasted it wouldn't work even when i spelled somthing random and tried to save it. Not a big issue but should be fixed soon for people who care about it."

I have continuous play on but it will only play 3-4 songs then close the app. I'm hoping there will be a fix soon or I will have to delete it. Update : It won't add tracks to my playlist! Sometimes the music stops between tracks until I unlock the screen.",

It never slowed down my device, neither did it fail to respond like the apps I was forced to uninstall did. The features of this app are really good, a number of options which I can 'manipulate' as per my wish.",
      "This works well so far, it comes complete with bass boost and equalizer (and they actually work). And for once I can edit my song's tags, it this is a amazing and efficient app. It's got customizable everything on it as well even the color! Keep up the good work and I love how if you do decide to buy this app its not over priced either just 2$ thanks again whoever developed this app.... had this app for six months now it still works great organizes my videos and my music awesomly!!!",
      "Excellent. It displays folders with music and can play it. You can rewind a song forward or back, a feature not every music player has, but this player has it. Other players are full of unnecessary features that are annoying, but this one is simpler and easier to use.",
      "This is the best, quickest, user friendly application I've come across in all my years of trying out hundreds. If you like your music then download and give this a go. I love the options, esp to record and drive mode. Good job guys."

      "This is a great app it plays and sounds great...the only problem I'm having is I made like 7 or 8 playlists and for some reason Everytime I turn off the app and don't use it for 24 hours or longer it erases my playlists..the album and name will still be there but when I click on it has 0 songs in all of them..is there something need to turn on\\off?..please help me figure this out it's very frustrating...lol..other than that I have no complaints it's an awesome app!!!! Thank you.",
      "The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it's useful for storing music. The only reasons I'm keeping it... it's a pre-install app in my phone and, it holds songs and original clips that I recorded and don't want to lose. Otherwise it would go straight in the trash. I don't like the layout and I absolutely HATE all of the ads that pop up everytime I open it to listen to music!",
      "I liked the app, easy to use. BUT i have a problem - some of my music folder's names are very long, and i can't see their full name. Can you please add this feature? I mean, that if a folder name is too long it would move / slide in a loop from left to right or right to left depending on the language used. Thank you.",
      "Honestly, in my own opinion, this music player is better than the one I had previously, the one I had previously repeated the same music until you opened the app and manually selected the song you wanted, but this music player is better than that...",
      "VERY GOOD. With this app I was able to set the levels in a way that I filtered out some very distracting sound artifacts from my noise canceling headphones. Not bad for a free app!"

      "A very feature rich player. It has everything one may look for in a video player. However, there's one thing I didn't like is that the UI and purple accent everywhere. Please make UI more visually appealing with options to customise and a library system for video player which shows files with meta data and tags like Netflix. I know that is way over the top one actually look for, but this would make it the best and only player with such features.",
      "This is just ok..video settings by this app is amazing& appreciable👏 but we have to adjust settings for every time in some aspects... Lot of improvements needed.. \"remember settings\" feature should be included..and manual brightness without depending on system brightness should also be included.. If so.. It will deserve better ratings..",
      "New version is really bad. Please go back to previous version. I can't move forward more than 24 seconds when I swipe right. When the play bar is on I can't move forward or backward at all. \"All video\" page is a disaster since the clips that I download in Whatsapp or Telegram are shown in there. Exiting the video is so much harder now. KMPlayer is still the best on any platform so fix these problems please!",
      "Love everything about KMplayer! Although, I did discover a minor issue. Player would not play a couple of my AVI movie files. It did play my other AVI files. Also would not play a DIVX movie file. Not a big deal I use another player for those files. Other than that, you guys did a FANTASTIC job with this video player! Thank you!!!!",
      "I've found and used so many video player apps but this player make me so amazing. Adding substitle (especially ass file) into a video made me crazy when I used the old apps but this app can do that easily and quickly with a lot of features and I like that. Everything is good until now."

      "I love this app very much.Video Player All Format (also known as XPlayer) is another good all-around media player for your Android needs, with broad format support, ultraHD and 4K playback ability and hardware and software decoding options. The app includes helpful extras like gesture controls, variable playback speed, and Chromecast support.",
      "Asked for help from the App developer on the 17th of February 2020 through the email address supplied here and today is the 5th of March and still no answer. Once you save your videos in the App there are no options to share the videos on social media. Also you cannot move your videos back to your normal photo gallery.",
      "issues 1)When you pause or exit the app, you come back to a frozen app that must restart 2)The sound will stop randomly 3) Can not exit without closing app, having to auto select popup is mondaine at times Benefits The interface is beautiful and it has everything you would want from an early high end DVD player. Skip. Jump to time. A-B loop. Chosing size format. Subtitles (must download but I use torrent so no biggy). Slide for brightness and volume. Please reply I want to give 5 ⭐ I adore it",

      "For this update: I guess this is where shovel-ware starts. It was nice, clean and fast player. With this update they are adding social integration. I guess i will stop updating this app and hope nothing breaks, because then i will have to look for alternatives. It was a good run while it lasted. Edit in response to the devs comment: I understand that its evolving, however powerful video player does not need those options. I still think this app is heading in a bad direction.",
      "It's a great app Does pretty much everything but prefer not to see ads in the way when stopping film with a double tap. (Theres always someone reading a text or letter in a movie essential to the plotline, but too small to read). The panning and zooming is another essential feature, but if you upgrade you have to uninstall and reinstall the pro version, then have to go through all the settings again to re set preferences, theres quite a few... this is the only negative, otherwise it's the best",
      "No way to adjust network cache. If your experiencing constant buffer or videos stopping completely switch to androids internal exo player or vlc with a high network buffer. My one star is because this is old news(YEARS)... And i forgot until i started traveling with weaker signal and slower internet than in the city, where the buffer plays a major role in smooth streaming experience.",
      "I want to draw an attention to the developers that they have not added video, music and other tabs in the pro player. We have paid for the pro player and yet we don't get all this things. However in the ad version which is free the users gets all the tabs of videos and all MX originals and other content. Can you tell me why is it that way. And if we are not going to get it in the pro version please refund the pro membership fee.",
      "Very powerful video playback apps😄👍 Use it for a long time! Supported it by purchasing premium version 🎁👍 Two suggestions: 1. Add more frequency controls to audio equalizer so user can change the loudness in narrower frequency range. Useful to enhance the frequency range of human voice without using complex algorithm like center channel extractor. 2. Read from Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox without or with minimal local caching."

      "I've been using it since 5 years, I've recently changed my device and the playlists keep clearing whenever I make one! It takes time to add loads of songs in a playlists and it sucks to see all the songs get cleared from the playlists. Please check!",
      "I love the app but I give it four stars, it's just because of the ads! Y'all should really do something about the ads. All and all it's lit app🔥",
      "Too many ads & Search engine cant find a single song. Search option should be able to find all songs in storage",
      "On LG Stylo (cheapest phone I could get), I hate it, but love this app. EQ DOES work and player functions as advertised. This could be my first official app purchase. (Yes I'm cheap and will not \"buy\" an app unless I am 100% happy). Ads do not interfere with functionality.",
      "Simplicity and multifunctional. Does exactly as it promises. Not too many invasive adds which is a nice gesture. Will definitely go premium in due course. Very well organized and visible library at a glance Keep up the good work guys!!!"

      "Update: the developer has replied to me how to get those features back, so now i can only complain about unintuitive settings layout. So yeah, it is the best player out there. The features were: 1. In the artist page the albums slider is small and inconvenient. It was better when the whole page was an album listing. 2. On the album page there were buttons to play now and queue the whole album. Where have they gone now?",
      "This app need improvement to support auto dark and light theme like new OS updates! Also instead of extra button on the music playing notification bar it must have a real support for sound bar! Which music can easily bhee controlled by the bar from the notification panel without opening the app(specially for the paid version which j have o. My phone!!!). I hope you will modify that software soon. 🙂🙂🙂👍",
      "I voted this three stars previously do to a bug and an issue I had thought was a bug. Within three days the developer responded, informing me that they are aware of the issue I had raised and the root cause of it. Track information can be changed by tapping the item. I believed this was a big, the developer informed me how to use the function properly. Keep in mind this is a free app, yet impeccable support.",
      "Plays most files types. Doesn't do custom smart playlist. It does come with a few smart playlists but only one of them is useful to me and that one isn't exactly how I want it. Navigating through folders is just bad. My main music is in a folder called My Music but I can't navigate to it. The app only lets me go to the Music folder. However, I still have access to the music in My Music by navigating by artist or album. Others apps don't have this problem. The sound is pretty good. In response to the dev. A more useful smart playlist would be one I could customize. Like for MM my one smart playlist is limited by play count 0, duration > 30 seconds, duration < 30 minutes, doesn't have christmas in title, genre, or album name, and physical location of the music. I have other smart playlist but that is my bread and butter. Your never played smartlist is good but is limited to what a few other players can do like mediamonkey, rocket player and gonemad",
      "3 stars because: 1) When I try to upload album cover images, it uploads sideways; 2) When I try to edit track info, it fails the first time, I have to close the app and reopen by clicking the file in my \"Downloads\" folder. Even then, sometimes, it won't let me update the \"Genre\" without failing. I have AT LEAST 3-5 genre-less songs. My OCD hates this. Please fix this with an update. Otherwise, I look for a new player & I've been loyal to y'all for so long."

The downside is that it can't read subtitles embedded in the MKV, however you can manually download subtitles from the Net.. The other downside is that it still can't play 4K HDR vividly, 4K HDR movies have somewhat muted colors.. However non-HDR movies plays with vivid colors.. Thumbs Up !",

      "I have been using Vidmate for a few years now, but i am about to uninstall both Vidmate and play it. Why can't i play videos with my built in video player like i used to, instead you force users to download your video player full of ads and videos that won't play in any other player. I am even removing these things from my phone immediately Play it: uninstalled 😁 Vidmate: uninstalled 😁",
      "This is forced me to install. I have just downloaded some HD quality videos but those are not running in the MX Player. There said have to need \"Play iT\" to run properly. This is cheating at all. Hate it most 😣😠😡🤬",
      "Amazing app #### All the apps I have been using this one has overtaken them all...very amazing 1.able to convert video into audio instantly, 2 able to go back to video again. 3.its user friendly and flexible....",
      "It will be better if the app developer should add it a time remaining function and screen auto rotation mode. Which works irrelevantly. On my phone. Better luck with next upcoming update of application.",
      "Sound clarify is satisfying without turn on the built in equalizer...yet kindly improve on video clarity...For there are video players with poor sound quality yet there video viewing makes me feel like I'm watching video from an actual dvd player. Hoping for an upgrade on video clarity for this app..."

      "This app's functionality is honestly incredible. It makes listening to music so much easier. It performs every activity required of a musical app, and that too for free. I wasn't pestered to give this report, I just was blown away and felt it would be really unfair if I failed to give a befitting review. This is the best there is! PS: I'd really appreciate if there was a feature to search and download songs in audio format as one can on Audiomack. It's only available on YouTube.",
      "I was really enjoying this app, but my android phone just went through an OS update. Now, after working on them for years, my playlists are GUTTED. Some playlists with 50 - 100 songs now have ONLY 15. Some playlists are COMPLETELY EMPTY. Happy to change to 5 stars if support can restore them. If I have to start over on my playlists, why should it be with this app?",
      "I've used this app for several years and loved it..... until today. I had saved about 800 songs over the past couple of years. I recently updated it and found that SOMEHOW during the update process it ELIMINATED at least 80% - 90% of my entire collection. Reckon I'll look for another player that doesn't destroy/delete my collections. Am I upset? H**L YES!!! ZERO STARS",
      "I have been using this for a long time and it's awesome. However, I have to take a star for now. There are times where some songs from a playlist just disappear and I have to add them again. Quite frustrating. Also at the moment, the change album is quite broken due to Android 10 update. Hopefully, you guys can fix this as soon as possible as I do love this app.",
      "New user here. Haven't had any issues so far. Easy to use. I can listen to music of all formats. App automatically detects downloaded songs. I can listen to it with or without wifi/on or offline. That is a huge plus while traveling. Another great feature is that I can listen to my music while my screen is locked. Sound quality is very good as well. I love this app thus far! Please DO NOT mess with this format."

      "its a fine music app, i just wish there were some adjustments that could be made. for one, the orange color primarily used is ghastly and honestly painful on phones that use primarily dark mode. it would be nice to be able to change this color, or at least have a darkmode friendly setting. its also unfortunate that you are unable to choose song by letter, as you can in so many other apps. otherwise, it works as intended",
      "I like this app very much. It has a sleep timer that I use when I go to sleep and it helps me through the night when it stops. The shuffle algorithm goes through all the songs instead of select ones and I really appreciate that. I would rate it 5 stars if it allowed me to change the album covers, but other than that, this app is great!",
      "I like this music player app! I've tried over 20 players and this one is easy to use. I can easily access songs on my phone to make my playlist with this app, very little to no searching to find the songs I want! (I have over 5,000 songs on my phone, so having them arranged the way this app categorizes them makes it much easier for me!) Thank you for this app! One of the best free music apps I've tried!",
      "I give 4 for the so far performance for me is very nice. The UI is simple easy to use unlike the other mp3 apps were complex and annoying to use. This one is not hassle shifting from artist to album to songs to folder is readily on the screen so quick. I will give 5 soon if performance is constant. Ladies n gentlemen out there I recommend this app just what I have enumerated, experience it for utself, anyway it's easy to uninstall.",
      "I love this app! It is convinience to use and it really exceeds my expectation. What I love about this is there is no advertisements and there is an option what's to show and hide as well and folder scanning. Really love it!!! 5 stars Thumbs up to developer of this app!!"

      "It's a great app, however it needs some improvements; the fact that IF you want to add a song into a Playlist, then you only can add a song 1 at 1 at the time, instead of just having the option to add multiple/all at the same time, which personally really does annoy me to be honest, since I want to make a Playlist full of rap, but I can't because it are 114 raps that I got downloaded, so I can't just do 1 at 1, that should take me literally hours to add them all to that specific playlist...",
      "I am unsure if this is able to work offline. I am looking for easy downloads as well as ability to play files offline. I'd also like to better be able to collect different generals of my music into seperate folders or files. So I don't accidentally play my heavy metal during church service...or strange instances such as that. This app has great sound!!",
      "If you report a bug, you get endless message like that. \"Any more comments just reply to this email and we will try our best to help you!\". And they do nothing. Never answer the email. Full of bugs and terrible support.",

      "This is the best music app you can get for free. It has: a 10 band graphic EQ, preamp. -10db to + 10 db. The preamp comes BEFORE THE EQ and not after like in iTunes, another bass tone control and Varible replay gain. You have the option of using a 32 bit, 192 khz engine which means if you have high definition files you can play them without a sample rate reduction or Truncating the last 8 or 16 bits. - Gapless playback. AND THE 10 BAND EQ IS STILL FREE!",
      "Well done Team Jet! Love this app (and I've bought most of the front runners). Above all, the sound quality is superb, very well balanced. Picks out the finer high-end details in tracks as well as offering plenty of solid low end to pack a punch. With a sublime and highly customisable user interface, this really stacks up to be one of if not the best premium audiophile-grade music player!!",
      "plays .aiff files, that's good. has ads and the close icon is tricky to hit at times, too bad we can't swipe an ad away. edit: forgot to mention the first EQ at the top of the system tray is great. especially in the car's sound system, just be mindful not to blow your speakers out.",
      "Deleting and finding new and much better app. Went downhill... had this player for 10 years, and now can't listen to music, as it shuts off-probably due to ads when locked. Very disappointed. Have to search for new player. Won't waste money buying this, especially if it didn't fix this issue."

      "Showbox is gone, at least for now. Showbox's issues have NOTHING to do with Lime Player. I've seen a few negative reviews for Lime Player blaming the Showbox situation on them and it's unjustified. It wouldn't matter what video player you used, Showbox is not going to work. Aside from being a little ad-happy, I've had no issues with Lime Player.",
      "You need to fix this app, this is getting so ridiculous. I can't even watch one movie without it randomly stopping and saying \"Sorry, we can't play this video\"!!!!!! I'm a serious Showbox user and you are making it very difficult to use their app without screwing up. I've been having issues with your app for a very long time and nothing changes, it's so frustrating!!!!",
      "This app is terrible. I literally only have it for Showbox and half of the shows/movies don't play with. And it's the only player that Showbox uses!! I just keep getting \"sorry, can't play this video(\". Showbox was way better before they were forced to use this trash. Edit: Now it won't load anything on there. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times and it still won't work. I know it's not my phone because I have the Razer phone 2 and it has better specs than most Android phones.",
      "This is the worst . First I am forced to download lime player just so I can use Showbox which stops playing every 2 minutes . I uninstalled and reinstalled to see if that would help , but no it didn't fix anything . I have sent multiple feedback and have not heard back for anyone , then I go into it's settings and find my camera videos on there . There is no need for my personal camera videos to be on there .Which I did not give any permission to. I'm seriously disappointed with this app",
      "I'm not sure about the problem everyone else is having, but mine works perfectly. I went into the settings and selected the Chromecast for streaming. I was apprehensive after reading some of the other reviews, but I've had no problems with Lime player at all. In fact, I like using lime player more than I did the way it was before. You can now pause the movie and start playing again without it restarting. Also, the phone's screen doesn't have to stay on while the movie is playing now."

      "This is easily the best music player app I've found so far. It looks slick, the UI is exactly what I wanted, the lyric display works perfectly without being difficult to get working, the tag editor is simple and useful and the covers appear in beautiful high res. I can't recommend this app enough, if you're like me and you're tired of the garbage music player on your phone this is your best bet. I rarely say this but I'm honestly considering buying the paid version as well.",
      "Since I've downloaded it, it's been great. Only thing is it'll sometimes separate songs from the same album, making a duplicate of an album that was just created despite info (artist, title, etc) all being the exact same, meaning there's no reason for it to create a duplicate album. Very irritating new bug (as of 2/24/20) that also abruptly and randomly stops the music and restarts it from the beginning when I open the app.",
      "I cannot create or update playlists externally (iTunes) and then reload them onto my phone. I think that the latest Pulsar update (January 9, 2020) may have replaced the use of \"relative location\" of files on a playlist with \"absolute location.\" Now, every time that I reload an updated playlist (m3u file), Pulsar shows 0 songs in that playlist. Mirroring my folder hierarchy on my phone is not an option because I have the same song on multiple playlists (but in only one folder). When will this be fixed?",
      "Good App.. EXCEPT.. It's great when I'm actually on the app page, I can access the controls, but if I leave something playing, to do something else, then the music continues, but then there is no indication of the controls, no bar with the play /stop button, nothing in the notification bar. If I need to stop it quickly (phone call etc) I have to go back to the main page and look for the app icon to re-open it, to stop the music playing That cant be right. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.",
      "Almost perfect. It's stylish, featureful, and the ability to blacklist certian folders was a \"must have\" for me. However, I have one gripe that I would love to see remidied. When looking at the track list, you can't see the album art. Just a play button. This really slows down the experience. When someone is about to select a song, their finger covers to song title, so being able to see the album art, to ensure they select the right song is really convient."

      "The best at all amongst all other players that are available on the Google play store in terms of performance, UI, them, visualizer, customizing options, beautiful animations, very elegant,  It feels so much better, But one only thing that I didn't love is that it can't change and song or album info although the option of change tags is available but It doesn't work, it seems working on it self I mean u can see the changes only in powerramp but u can't see that in other apps Which's not good",
      "Please add the A-B repeat option. That's the only thing that this app needs. I cannot explain the how good is this app in words because there are so many of them. The first app on Google Play which I bought. Because this app just suite my usage and option I am looking for and the price is also too reasonable and low.",
      "INCONSISTENT. They're constantly changing the settings (for the worse). Has way TOO MANY options, & most don't work properly. Paid for this years ago, & used to love it. Has gotten progressively worse, & I'm FED UP with having to reconfigure the player every time, to simply play my f%@#!n music. UPDATE 3/7/20: Now that I left a bad review, player mysteriously deleted 1/2 of my 4500 mp3s before I shut my phone off to stop it. Thank God I have them backed up on my computer. F.U. PowerAmp !!!",
      "The OG...been using power amp since the 90's, still great! Bought the app for my first smart phone and have been getting massive amounts of use from it since, feels kinda cheap on my end honestly, I spent $4 like 15 years ago and this is still my favorite music app and it will be yours too once you get used to it, very powerful player with huge amounts of options and deep control. Huge fan of the app and the company, you won't regret use this and like me you'll end up buying it eventually!",
      "Before the forced Android 10 update from AT&T this app worked fine on my Note 9. Now, however, every time I plug my phone into a TV (using a HDMI connection) the player just starts playing automatically at full volume. It is totally annoying. I have the poweramp paid version. Also I have the poweramp widget on my home screen. After you fix this, I will change my review from 3 to 5 stars."

      "Constantly hijacks my BT on connection even with the proper settings. The play once feature needs to be on the play screen instead of buried in settings. See jetaudio for reference. UI looks very cartoonish. Again, reference jetaudio for comparison. Only two things going for it right now. CC support and Playlist support with Android 10. Response: none of my other audio apps have this issue. So regardless of what my car is doing, your app alone is broken. Pulsar, jetaudio, pandora...no issues.",
      "I've been using this app for 3 years and it remains to be the best music player in my opinion. However, the only issue is that for the last month the app will no longer download any missing artwork. And this is for popular music whose artwork would be easy to find. I have a subscription as well so any help with that would be much appreciated.",
      "I had a problem with double listing of playlists (which ended up being my fault). I received an unbelievable customer care response. Not only this player is fantastic...it also works perfectly with isyncher which allows seemless integration with iTunes to Android. Highly recommended !!!!",
      "Suuuuper Angry! 😡 When I played a song it showed a random picture from my phone in the background. Went to settings and selected that I wanted the picture file to be the one that corresponds to the mp3 file. Didn't change. Deleted that picture from my phone still didn't change. I selected \"IN THE APP\" to \"Reset Database\" to which it does warn that you will lose all playlists and song information. But it doesn't just delete from app it deleted from my entire phone!! ALL SONGS GONE FROM MY PHONE!",
      "By far the best music player for Android, and a note to any iTunes user; This is the only music player that can sort by 'album artist' and 'artist' in 2 seperate zones. Gets updates aswell which is good for any paid app."

      "Overall, does the job. A few tweaks would be nice. I'm not exactly as agile as a cat, but when the song changes with each step I take, the 'change song by shaking phone' function might be a wee bit sensitive. I'm scared to try it while driving, with all the potholes. And there's no way to change the mustard yellow colour, which is unfortunate. For basic functions, though, a solid music player.",
      "It would be nice if I actually could experience the app before it asks me to give a rating. I have no idea whether or not I like it yet. I literally opened the app, clicked on playlist, then tried to click back page to return to all music; then came the ask to give you a 5-star. Therefore i am asking you, how about writing an algorithm that allows a person at least 5 minutes to give 5 stars? This action may actually get you a proper review.",
      "It's a good app with sleep timer, playlists, smart share and other great features. I rated it four stars because of its limited song sorting and categorizing abilities. For example, there is no way to sort songs by genre, sub-genre, or nearly any of the ways that you can do so in iTunes or some of the better music players.",
      "I searched forever to find my old app it used to let me edit song details when it would download showing artist as song title or had numbers that shouldn't be there then it updated and quit editing and all older edits went back . I found this one and it was easier to fix the details it didnt let me accidentally change the song each time and just easier. So far I love it thanks.",
      "As soon as I opened the app I started having problems with it automatically picking songs and playing them when I didn't want it to. And then when I exited out of the app, it wouldn't let me close it or stop the music. Uninstalled after having it 5 min"

      "I absolutely love this app, definitely recommend! The widget works great, no glitches or issues. Honestly this music player has so many features I can't name them all. The main reason I am so pleased with it is because I spent a solid hour downloading multiple different music player apps (Samsung music, Free Music Player, Stellio Music Player, PI MusicPlayer, etc) but none of these could locate the songs I had stored on my SD card.. Except this one! Thank you so much for such a great app.",
      "You won't believe, but it is true that I haven't used any other music player since 2017. Best thing is that the developers are not greedy, so there is no ads. Even it is a small sized app but it doesn't lack any feature that a music player should have. I can't explain how much I love this app. Just more than what I expected. Not paid apps are able to do this. I am proud to be an Indian 😘😘😘😘❣️❣️",
      "My search for a music player has come to an end! I am a very suspicious person, so i don't like apps that request for features they traditionally wouldn't need (calculator app requesting for location info, music player requesting for internet access, etc). I don't don't really have need for the extra perks that comes with. This player simply plays your music. Period! I love a minimalist look. No fancy themes, picture backgrounds and stuff. I love some color though. Life is colorful 😊 This app is pure and simple. No one loves apps that take forever to load. That's why we are always updating our gadgets to the latest, fastest, and most efficient ones. Since this player does not have all the extra features that most music players have, of all music player apps I've tried, this one loads the fastest, by a big margin. A plus if you have less than 2GB RAM (have used it on a 1GB phone and it was flawless). Most of all, the things i can do with this app in terms of organizing the music on my phone is simply UNBELIEVABLE. Even if it failed in every area as I've explained, with what i can do... I would still persevere having it. I can move music to different folders, remember last played position for any track (just what i need for my 2+ hr reggae mixes), and the list goes on and on. If you are like me, try it. You just might like it. If you like fancy themes, this may not be for you.",
      "App is great... truly grateful. Alright...so I've changed my handset, after installation of application I'm not able to change the album art. For eg:- if I want to keep some random image for the song being played... it's not working. It gives me option to select the image from the gallery but after selection it goes back to normal musicolet logo. Need some solution on this... kindly revert.",
      "After Android 10 update in my Realme device, i am unable to play music smoothly and sometimes volume remains high all the time which cannot be adjusted. Please fix this issue soon. I am using this app for more than a year and truly impressed by the features it provides, especially the equalizer which can be tuned according to our needs."

      "I've been searching for a decent music playing app for Android and have failed miserably until now. This app is great—beautiful interface, organizes well, allows you to change metadata, and lots and lots of customization options. The best thing is that it actually reads the cover art for each song correctly, as I've had apps in the past that confuse album art of same-name albums by different artists or artists with multiple albums. The only thing I wish it had was a \"list view\" for albums and artists or a way to click and drag the scroll bar. It can take a while to scroll to a particular artist without these features. But overall, I love it!",
      "It's a great music player, but I've run into a really weird problem with it when using Bluetooth to connect to my car's media player. If I use Stellio to play media the connection is extremely unstable. If a song is playing I can't connect reliably at all. The song might play for seconds at a time, then the connection is lost, it reconnects, only to be lost again moments later. Edit: Translate Song Metadata is already activated. So this is unfortunately not the solution.",
      "This music player has so much potential and it's really good. The thing it needs is an option to disable/enable some of the side options like genres, artists, folders, albums, etc since I don't use some of them. Also while in the playlists option, there needs to be a way to sort the playlists in alphabetical order and there should be a list view option in playlist instead of the grid view that it shows. Other then that, this is one of the best music players in the play store hands down.",
      "Okay, awesome player! Covers do download but this is the only issue can't stand from this player. They take forever and ever, to just get the covers downloaded. I have a 400 gb micro sd card. Again I have 22,000+ songs with full albums of all discographies of artists but still other players do not take this long for covers, and other players have option to use already in file covers too. So this could be why it takes so long because of the no option for preferred covers from file instead. I guess I will have to every once in a while leave the connection on to finish downloading covers. What hassle but oh well. This is on a 75 Mbps connection too.",
      "It is my favorite player app, but since a few updates There is a problem, which is that when you enter the app after a few minutes, a notification appears saying that you have to update the theme (Jfrost) to continue using it. I already have it updated and it is annoying that every time i entered the app that notification still appears. Edit: thanks for the Tip, I tried and it didn't work. however I tried uninstalling and installing and it worked. thanks!"

      "Best music player ever, cool design, great sound & awesome features. Registered with a monthly subscription from the first 2 minutes of usage. You can delete files from within the app, music loads fast, browsing and sorting is intuitive. The only negative thing I found: it looses star ratings after you move the rated files around, so it must have its own database for storing the ratings instead of appending them to the file. All in all great app.",
      "Well it's a great app and everything else but it needs to be updated for the new Android updates and it should read all the music to your phone because I have a 256gb SD card and dont read helf the music from micro sd at all that issue needs fixed",
      "It would be an awesome app and get 5 stars from me if the equalizer worked like it should. From when I first installed the app equalizer worked fine until 2nd song started and then it started sounding like equalizer off but says its on. After trying to make adjustments to no avail, I had to exit out of app and then open again...equalizer will work through maybe a couple songs and then just turn off or stop working. Fix this please cuz it's a great music player...and too many ads also. Thanks.",
      "Overall a good app. However when used in parallel with Runtastic app, the player often stops playing music after the Runtastic gives audio comments. And there is no obvious pattern when it happens: we are talking about Runtastic comments that come after every kilometer of running is completed - sometime the player stops after 5km, sometimes after 7-8km, and almost always it stops at 12km and continues to do so every following kilometer. Very unpleasant and distracts from sport as the music has to be restarted so often. Same on Android 4 or 5 and 9.",
      "I was looking for a music player app that would work on a android tablet that could simulate a car stereo interface. NRG is the closest that I have found so far. My only wish is that I could have the option, in landscape mode,of just seeing the current song playing. I am still planning on purchasing this app because the buttons are large and the ease of the ability to change playlist while driving."

I subscribed to TDS Host which is a streamlined network of many channels which I really like. It has been a number of days and cannot watch anything, The channel list appears, but url is not. I contacted the TDS HOST people and they say everything is good on their side . My tv is also in good shape. Any thoughts?",
      "Good app but lost two stars for two very important issues. The first is, there is no exit/and button. Have to go to main screen on phone. Please include an exit/end button on next update. This has been an issue for several people. Second issue in no support for fire devices. I have several fire cubes I would like to run this on, but can not get the paid version to work. I paid, but since fire uses the Amazon account, can not get ad free ( no Amazon version of app).",
      "Definitely one of the best. On my Nvidia Shield (Tube) is does crash and fail to open again regularly. I have to clear all data to get it to reopen. Also you can't copy and paste into the URL boxes for playlist and guide PLEASE ENABLE THIS! you can currently only paste into the description box but the shield app doesn't recognise the URL box as a text box! Combined with the frequent crashing this makes re adding the URLs very painful.",
      "Used this app for a few years faultlesly and its been my go to app i really like it, seems to be issue tho with the new 4k firestick and channels with a higher bit rate on this app tho, glitchy and crashes it, i have informed app developer and hopefully he can fix this",
      "Good player. But interface is different from others. Use on Sony Bravia. Wish list: Buttun SELECT do pause. Button BACK do back to tv guide and stop video. Please change it's more intuitive. Perfect for 4k videos"

      "Pretty good high quality digital audio player app for what it is. UI is a little dated, but it's features and easy to use access far outweigh the flaws. Overall really great app. Update: They have updated the UI, making it look fresh and clean, and there are even more features such as customization. I'm moving my rating from 4* to 5*.",
      "This is a FANTASTIC app! Sounds way better than a standalone mp3 player and with many, many more options, FOR FREE. I just spent close to an hour working through the equalizers, options, and getting everything dialed in on my AudioTechnica headphones and the sound quality is unbelievable! I will never buy a standalone mp3 player ever again. I would gladly pay money for this app. You won't be disappointed.",
      "The AIMP player produces very good, nice and natural sounds it's very near to the hi-res sound. After searching and trying hundreds of music player, I've found that the AIMP player is way way better than any other music player apps. Perhaps it's the best music player you can have for free. Keep the good work, and many thanks to the developer team because its still free and no ads at all. Thank you very much. Maybe I would buy the pro version with a lot of features packed there.",
      "Absolutely great, love it However, since the last update I can't export playlists to my SD card anymore.. I get a popup saying \"Java.IO.FileNotFoundException\" edit: It does have storage permissions and I manually gave it permission to the root of the card but i get a toast message afterwards: java.io.FileNotFoundException: EACCES (Permission denied) Android Version: 10 Security Patch Level: Jan 1, 2020 Google Play System Update: 2020-02-01",
      "sorting musics could be a bit better, like auto detecting song , albums ,etc .... other than that IT IS THE STRONGEST MUSIC PLAYER FOR ANDROID . I mean for real it is. it has a clean theme , the strongest equalizer and so on... It's been a long time that I'm using AIMP on my laptop , now my mobile's default music player is AIMP as well 😘👌🏻"

      "I've used this app for years now and never saw a reason to bother with another one. But now I need to switch to another option. I use music on my phone to deal with sensory issues. Unfortunately, Google has decided to start sneaking Tracks It Thinks I Might Like (I think) on my playlists every here and there. At first, I could delete them and found an option to tell it to stop downloading them. But now, it streams them instead, and I can't just get rid of them with the 'delete' button anymore. This is extremely disrupting and, in areas of higher stress/sensory input, downright distressing. I need to switch to another music player because and only because I can't find an \"off setting\" for its new \"add random music you don't own to your Playing Now\" habit. If they decide to fix this and I find out that they fixed it, I really wouldn't mind going back to it. But for now, it's a no-go for me.",
      "Has a lot of problems really. It crashes, it always restarts the songs everytime I play them. I can't find most of the artists I listen. I mean Bethel Music is a really popular group but they don't have most of their content. Scrolling problem, not enough distance between the 3 dots and the scroll line. I'm really dissatisfied. Please fix it.",
      "Can you please fix the scroll problem? There is very little space between the scroll bar and the three dots symbol for each song. This is incredibly frustrating when you are trying to add multiple songs to a playlist. If you tap a couple of millimeters to the right, the scroll button gets activated and takes you to a random portion of the song list. I can't believe Google hasn't fixed this yet.",
      "Weird beeping has started to play every time a button is pressed or the song auto plays to the next in a play list SO ANNOYING, can't seem to find a fix for this. It is random, sometimes it's there and other times it doesn't do it. Have sent feedback from the app but that goes no where. I'm going to download all my songs and use the dafault Samsung music app.",
      "Best music player before I began to use a samsung. Even now, play music is yet one of the top music apps; if not among the top 3. However, we can add the search feature to the app, so one could search, stream and download any music. This would perfect play music and increase the rate of downloads. Already, it's been from Google LLC, but adding the feature suggested would make this app top 3. Another feature we can add is the dark mode. Thanks and well done Google LLC. Nick, Nigeria."

Immediately removed from my systems...",
      "This is the best video player but lacks some basic features such as 1. Search option to search for media in local folders(it is essential) 2. Background playback, 3. Folder sorting in two major divisions(internal and external storage) and then under them their subfolders. Please make these improvements.",
      "The ability to show subtitles on Chromecast looks promising, but how do I download subtitles with this App? VLC, MX player and others have easy ways of downloading subtitles, but they cannot cast the subtitles. This App claims it can cast subtitles but has no ability to download subtitles? How odd!",
      "It works great, no issues. I like that I can be on video call and watch videos at the same time",
      "Perfect video player, it. The attributes are just a amazing. For example, While watching a video, you could actually view the list of videos you have already watched, without going off from the current video... Also, you can hide personal videos in a secret folder. In addition to this, the video quality, as well as sound quality is commendable as well. Really cool app ."

      "Absolutely brilliant!! I started using Nova Player as Archos stopped working on my Nvidia Shield TV. It's so easy to use and you have the ability to change the poster art and thumbnails. I have it connected to my Western Digital PR2100 and it has scraped all my movies. The 'use other player' option is good, as I use Kodi in conjunction with it and I'm very pleased with the playback quality. It also has regular updates too, so I highly recommend this app.",
      "Actually surprised by how good this app is on my Nvidia shield. Not a big fan of Kodi so a media player that scrapes titles for tv and movies is a big plus. Like the ability to download subtitles quickly as well. One minor negative is that there's only one other aspect ratio on the app and it distorts when in full screen because of the A.I upscaling feature on the shield. Not the only app that has this problem. Still, it's an excellent app that should be the default on the shield. Two Thumbs up!",
      "Seems to be working for Android TV 9. I see an option for playlists, but I don't see how to make one for the videos I keep on an external USB drive. The only options I see are sync with trakt account which I don't have or want or a rather cryptic note to create it by adding new items from video info. No idea what is meant by that, can't find how to do that.",
      "This is a great app which offers customization options. It has a great interface though I prefer a dark gray or black background instead of blue. Also, I am doing zooper widget templates and it would be best if the app has shortcuts which i can use in zooper. For instance when i click a specific widget icon it will directly go to the specific playlist or video. It has no shortcuts which I think will be a great addition to this app.",
      "This video player is absolutely phenomenal.I haven't yet tried regretting going premium with this app. One thing, every update just make the app more delightful using it . One suggestion though, can you make the background dynamic?. Where the backdrop changes colour as to what you currently selecting on screen. That would make your app even more complete"

      "Edit 3/4/20: I thought it was only fair to amend my review. For a week after the update it did not work. Then suddenly it started working. I made no changes to my device, did not even restart it. Don't know if tbe author did a quick fix or what, but it does not crash anymore trying to read files. [Old review] Great update guys! BSPlayer has been working fine for years, but now if I try to play my mp3 files on my SD card it freezes and dies. I dont have time for this.",
      "Very-very poor recent update. It has great problem with smooth playback. Video is not playing smooth, freezes each 2-3 seconds. Please send previous version until you fix this. Otherwise, I will uninstall your app after more than 3 years of using it Device - Xiaomi Mi6 (glabal)",
      "I'm very disappointed with the ui changes the feature to bring up fine controls for brightness and sound is gone, now only useless ui swiping. The symbol vanished from my apps page, ad desktop. Can only run thru playstore Please either undo this release, put out a classic version in the playstore with original gui and fix the app symbol. I suspect you upgraded to support some of the newer android versions and messed up backward compatability. Very bad.",
      "Completely destroyed my use of this app. New \"features\" terrible, navigation totally shot,now doesn't play significant number of videos. Lost all my played marks so have lost my place with all videos and now I can't see which I have watched. I want to revert to previous version",
      "was a great player in the past, now completely unreliable!!! Wow another 2 fixes for what worked great, now it won't play any videos at all, maybe you need to buy the pro version for the optional feature of playing videos now, yeah good work again 😡🙄😒"

      "I would give 5 but recently it started playing different songs than what it said. I figured it was my phone so I tested it when I later got a new one (for different reasons) and the same thing happens. It says x song but I'm hearing y song. It wouldn't be a problem if it was just when I'm scuffling ALL of my songs but it happens when I'm listening to one of my playlists. Itll play songs that aren't even on the playlist. Please fix this, its very frustrating",
      "A great app for playing your music. The interface is costumizable and many skin options to choose from. You can edit song tags, playlist and add album covers. The colors match the album cover which is a nice visual. The free version has pop up ads and the EQ is not that perfect, but overall is way better than Google Play. Highly recommend.",
      "I find this to be a great music player. I wanted a music player that would recognize folders because of how I sort my music . The previous app I was using developed a bug that would automatically play the last song from my phone when I got in my car weather her I called it up or not. I still really like this music player, but I don't like the adds that interrupt everything. I decided to spend the 6.99 ONE-TIME purchase to remove adds. My subscription went through as .99/monthly. This is the choice that I didn't want. I don't know how to change this. They just forced me into the more expensive plan. NOT COOL!",
      "This is the best media player I've used by far. No gripes whatsoever, keep up the good work! Edit: VERY unfortunate that I have to re-rate this app so low... It seems they started focusing more on full screen, spammy ads than the actual experience of the user. It lags horribly now and will even completely hang up mid-song forcing you to restart your phone before it will play again (that or do a hard restart of the app which is a long process when you have the widget install on your homepage).",
      "This is a fantastic music player . . . when you buy it. The ads are super-intrusive if you don't. Have fun waiting five seconds for the playable ads to disappear every single time you want to switch songs. Docked it a point for that. Still rated it a four though because what is there is great. Making playlists and editing tags are easy to do and you can customize how it looks using either the basic colors the app offers or even using pictures from your phone. It's a good."

      "The app delivers an absolute brilliant sound quality! I use it in combination with an external USB DAC and compared to other music players the equalizer and gapless playback works flawless. What I really would like to have it's that once you listen to a song and step back to the albums/artists there is no way to switch back to the currently playing track unless you're back at the home screen. Also it would be nice to use the app in landscape mode.",
      "Best audio player in terms of playback quality. I enjoy it so much I paid to unlocked all features. If you have a OnePlus 3 like me, using this app you can play to usb earphones/devices if you go into settings and enable OTG. Why did I reserve one star? 1) It lacks playback for FTP server. 2) even after buying the hf activate key, sometimes the player won't recognize the key",
      "This player sounds good and sweet.. I don't think this process bit perfect. The sweetness must be coming from the signal processing. Important thing that I think really need to be added is the capability to read and play CUE file. Oh.. If it could play DSD ISO and .ape files, those are good bonus too..",
      "It's good but not great. Sometimes it won't find my new music that is added. It never backs up playlist properly, and they need to add a sleep timer.",
      "Amazing, it drives my Xduoo link on my Note 10+ I can play my files on DSD direct transfer without a problem, the only wish is the custom EQ shall be modified by values instead of a finger, it moves the frequencies."

Other than that, if we can either get new themes or personalize our own, I'd be ecstatic. - (added) seems to be another bug where it randomly turns on Shuffle when I just want to go through my albums normally. Could you get rid of that blue shuffle button on the album page?",

And, when tapping to share on Messaging, it takes you there, but with NO mp3 in tow.) You can EDIT. **But, whilst you can cut the length of an mp3, there's sadly NO Fade-In/Fade-Out.😒 (ONLY BETWEEN SONGS, as BASIC music player.) WOULD'VE been my all-in-one music app, otherwise. Now, have to keep searching for THAT GEM.🤔 (Used to have, but lost it when I changed phones.) Many, many ADS. -"

      "The app is good but there is a huge problem, recently added songs to my device is not recognized by the app, hence is super annoying and no matter what matter I do, the problem is not corrected. This problem occurred in the recent update, never had this issue before, would give a 4 or 5 stars if not for this problem. The recently added songs are on my device(SAMSUNG A30) but is not recognized by the app itself, PLEASE FIX.",
      "What is it that I have to do to be able to click on the first song in an album, and then have it play the whole album in the right order? What is the arrows circling with an A in the center icon for? It only shuffles the currently playing album, whether I have shuffle on or not. This app didn't used to do that, so what happened? You consider \"Next song is not played in some models\" (in [16.2.21.6] fixes) to be an improvement? It seems like all kinds of weird random stuff is not working properly with this app, going off the other reviews. What happened to the quality we used to get with Samsung?",
      "Not good, the music suddenly just stops. I had a Samsung galaxy S5 and the music would play for a while then just stop, so I had to press the play button again, it happened very often, I assumed it was because I had an older model, I've just upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S10, I've downloaded this app and it does the same thing again, plays for 5 mins and then just stops, please tell me why Samsung?",
      "Up until yesterday, I've loved the seamless way Samsung Music manages music, especially playlists . However, after the most recent Android system upgrade, my playlists have been stripped of all their tracks.  The songs are still there, visible on my SD card,  but the most important part of the equation (the playlists) have disappeared. When will this problem be fixed? I'd be happy to give this app 5 stars once it resolves this issue",
      "Good app, nice UI interface for on-phone music but inflexible when it comes to selecting which music to include in your collection. It will select all music file types on your phone (including call recordings, ringtones, etc) and include them in your library with no capability of excluding tracks/folders. it's all or nothing. It's a shame since otherwise this is a very good interface for playing music. It will also link to Spotify (but you can't log into it) but no other streaming services."

      "This is a beautiful app. Sends music, plays via folder, has nice themes etc. I only have two problems with it for now: 1. The search function Instead of giving me the results of the song or artist that I am searching for, it gives me all the songs and then at the bottom of all my songs it gives me the results. I think that's a bug. Please fix this. 2. The widgets When I add it's widgets they don't show the play/pause, prev and next buttons. Please fix this too. Thanks, Regards Ludwe",
      "Great music player if you've sorted all your music files into folders. UI is clean, Themes are custom and able to be changed. Home menu can be easily customized to reduce clutter. Screen off mode can help save battery when you play music and leave the screen off. Pro mode is completely optional, and you don't have to get rid of any ads--because there are none I've ever bumped into.",
      "Great app, looks stunning with plenty customization options and, unlike some other music players I've tried, doesn't change the album track order. My only gripe is that, when you disabled automatic download of the album covers, the album section doesn't display any covers even if all the tracks from that album have an album cover. Singular tracks still display the cover. It's somewhat of a minor gripe. The rest od the app is awesome.",
      "Installed it today, but it looks pretty good so I'll give 5 stars for now. There's an issue and a suggestion tho. The issue is that I can't download artwork, it says that it failed. The suggestion is that the albums should be ordered by year, not alphabetically.",
      "So far; So good! All other music players I downloaded would play music with an echo - ish playback sound and it was very frustrating to listen to. This music player tho does not have that echo - ish sound. Keep up the good work. If I can think of any suggestions on how to make the app better, I will submit my feedback, Developers!"

I use to play a video while treadmill excersise and wish to change speed with one or two finger. This app support speed adjust but need to click 3 times. I use it for an hour and wish to give more feedback. Anyway, it is best. Thank you.",
      "Best video player I've used so far. Basic function all meet the needs, very rare the player can increase to 4x playback speed but audio still can play stably. The only thing is popup player function too less compare to others like foating app. Hope popup video can resize, able to select video in other folder instead of only current playlist, and more function to use in future let me uninstall floating app.",

It seems that I'm stuck with the ads...seems that they don't want my money! So, only 4 stars now. Fix this for the full 5 stars! Problem fixed!",
      "I'm an old user of this app. Since 2016! Whenever I change my phone I always remember to download this app. I always wish to have a better version of this app. But recently I'm using a Samsung phone and I'm having some issues like it's automatically disable the bass whenever I change the volume. Now I have to hear the entire song with same volume to continue bass mode on or hear the song with bass by continously turn it (Bass) on whenever I change the volume. So what should I do now? Help me!",
      "Tried lots of music apps. This is one of my favourites . Most other app are a variation of the same thing, this has a different layout, the colour and look can be customized by the user. Variable crossfade, graphic equaliser and a nice big volume control knob which a lot don't have. Displays Album art, track and artist info NO INTRUSIVE ADDS.",
      "Decent app...but a few significant probs for me. When on the playing track screen and I navigate to library, it doesn't start at the artist or album I'm currently listening to; it defaults to the top of whatever is in my library. Also the track being played doesn't interface correctly through bluetooth to my vehicle screen via \"Ford Pass App\" connectivity.",
      "I have had this app for as long as I can remember, and I'm sorry to say that I may be removing it. The app plays music quieter than the mp3 file is even when the volume is at max and the extra volume control is at max. I had this at a five star rating before I ran into this glitch."

      "Disclaimer: I love this app. I've been using it for 2 years and have had amazing experiences. Some things I think this app could possibly work on: 1. Sometimes after I've added a song to a playlist or my favorites, then I rename it, the song disappears from these places and it's only shown in its origin folder. 2. This is just a suggestion but I would love to be able to add a song to queue, and to be able to see the queue somewhere (maybe somewhere in the now playing screen).",
      "I was expecting this app as scam, but when i tried it, i dont have flexible (programmable) folder player better than this APP. How i wish you add A-B reapeat, then i will stop using any music player app. Thank you very much, but please let the app be free forever :)",
      "This is everything I wanted in a player. I needed a player that would not go to sleep, would play all of the files in my my folders in sequence and would play all of my folders in sequence and their files on sequence. This is very important for listening to audio books. The player remembers where it left off on the previous play session. I love it!",
      "An excellent free sound file player. The adverts are not obtrusive. It allows you to group music files in to play-lists. I like that it remembers where you were, in playing a music file, when you close it down, and that it continues playing, when you put it in the back-ground. The controls are bold and easy-to-use. A highly recommended app.",
      "There's apparently no way to do something as simple as deleting a playlist, even when the audio source files have been deleted. (Edit: The developer responded telling me to do something I tried many times, so I'm gonna assume it's just my old phone and change my rating to 4 stars. I appreciate devs taking the time.) (2nd edit: Been using the app for a long time now and whatever bugs may have been there have been worked out and the app functions great! 5★)"

Album Artist - I would like the ability to sort my music collection by Album Artist in addition to or instead of simply Artist. 2. Gapless playback. 3. Folder hierarchy - All the folders are lumped into one big long list. Annoying if you sort by Genre/Album Artist/Year-Album as I do. 4. Ad-removal - the option to pay to remove ads.",
      "ONLY 1 FLAW! Pay to remove the adds please. I LOVE the player it's easy to use and the most important thing is you can build PLAYLIST very easily. I am not a streaming music person and I own my music so I want A music player to at least let you easily make playlists and this one does it. Love the retro cassette players and cassette selection. Reminds me of the days I had made my own cassette mixes. I would give it 5 if you can remove the annoying add at the top by paying a few bucks.",
      "Excellent, really love this player. I also love actual cassette players and own a few. Great app for plugging into the amp at home and playing you faves while relaxing watching it play, and also great for surprising people down the pub when you show them it playing.😄💖",

      "Good. Complete menu. But seem not compatible with realme xt. When setting equalizer, for virtualization, sound error happened. Else is, when touch bass then sound louder it self. But if we already sett all the things, playlist, equalizer, etc then only touch play then... Good enough",
      "After using another music player app for years and years, and trying 100s of other apps that works the way I like to use it, looks like I found this app which can replace my current app. I like all the features implemented: one of the most I like is lyrics. If i don't have it, I can search online and get it. Another one is sleep timer - I like to sleep with music in my ears and this works perfectly fine. Stopping after few minutes. Here are some of the recommendations to improve this app: Hash player accepts the signals like play, pause, next, prev from my Bluetooth headphones, but it doesn't work with car's Bluetooth When playing folder wise, I can play specific folder and it's sub folders. But, it actually shuffles the order of songs. It would be nice to have option to keep in order by folders, such as all music files of folder 1, folder 2, folder 3 and so on. Obviously with shuffle, which is currently existing. Also,it would be nice to have option to delete music file from storage, directly from the playlist. So, if song is too old or someone got bored of that song can directly delete from the playlist and doesn't have to go to file explorer and find that song and delete.",
      "Using 2-18-20 update? Does exactly what i need to learn languages. BUT, the elapsed time and total time fonts must be MUCH larger. Also, i would like to see the scrolling file name use a larger font. The blue box above the timeline with the music note is useless for me. Perhaps you could replace the blue box with a larger scrolling bar that goes across the entire width of the screen. 🙌. 2-28-20 This app just gets better as i learn to use it",
      "Fantastic. This app is really great. First of all, it is moving to listen and enjoy every single song in my playlist. Next part is fit to song's lyrics. The last but not least, it has sleeptime, because I have problem about sleeping at night, so I need music to lure me and not waste my phone's battery too much such as googleplay music. That's all I like about this app. By the way, I think you guys should make some theme for this one because it's quite simple, I like somethings being colorful.",
      "I love this app . Last night i installed this app and the good thing is it doesn't contain ads . The best part i find out in this music player is sleep timer and ringtone cutter . We can cut any part of song and set them as ringtone . This app has much more valuable features ...😍 Conclusion is that I'm happy with this app"

      "I'm updating my review because the advice the developer gave me corrected 1 of my problems. Sadly, other problems persist. For example, when you put an artist with a large music catalog in your library, the app takes literally 10-12 seconds to load that artist's albums when you click on their name. And that's every time you click on them; not just the 1st time the app scans the files. Again, the app is gorgeous, but there's always a problem that makes me not want to use it. It's just too slow.",
      "I have been using this app for years now. Recommended to several people. But it has been a nuisance lately. It does not detect new music I have downloaded even though they are .mp3 format. I've scanned the folders in which the music is present. It says 'cant open file' when I click on file through folders. The app crashes every time I open details of such files. It plays well nice in other default players with no issues. Will probably switch to a different player even though I don't want to.",
      "UPDATE (3/3/2020): After the developer informed me of the issue with Android 10 concerning music players and music files stored on SD cards, I've updated my rating from 3 to 5 stars. While I still can't favorite any tracks, I found a way of working around the problem with the other playlists. I create the playlists in the stock LG music player app, which shows up in the Retro Music Player app (I have yet to try transferring my music files from SD card to the phone's internal storage). And the developer's suggestion that I use Google Photos to upload a photo for the avi instead of my phone's gallery also worked. Meanwhile, the app functions seamlessly on my tablet, which is running Android 7. PREVIOUS (3/2/2020): Retro Music Player is definitely one of the better music players out there. I love the level of customization afforded to users. However, I've noticed a new bug where everytime I try to favorite a track by tapping on the heart icon, the app crashes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didn't help. And, of lesser concern, is the inability to add a photo for the avi. The upload page loads forever and won't let me back out of it. I have to close the app and then wait a few seconds.",
      "Lost all my playlists :( Overall this app is pretty good and has a nice interface but one morning I woke up to find all my playlists were gone. My music is still there and yes I can still remake the playlists but it is quite tedious and I am worried it will happen again so will not be using the app in future.",
      "I'm not able to play sonngs from the songs tab. So i always go to album and start playing them. Or restart the app. Hope tgis can be resolved. I love your app. Using it since almost a year. Its a gift in this world of ad driven apps. Thank you. You've made my music experience pleasant."

I tried separate media control apps, but they don't work well with non-rooted phones.  Thanks, d."

      "Best look that I have ever seen, and I tried many. Easy to share music. In short, it does what most players do but looks better. However, I cannot seem to delete a single song from a playlist. All that I see is an option to delete an entire playlist, which is annoying. Therefore, making playlists is a nightmare if you forgot that a song was already there. It adds duplicates! Additionally, it does not automatically add art, and freezes constantly. This should be fixed as soon as possible.",
      "Not perfect with the configuring of music files, so ask away on the subreddit, but it's really sleek for it's price (free or $2), sleeker than Spotify. Use Automatag, the app, for extra help with tagging things. We've come a long way in Mobile music player user interfaces since the first mp3 players and iPods, and this one is my favorite so far."

Like the spinning record with the album art in the middle and the turntable arm (would be even nicer if the turntable arm moved from beginning to end as the song progressed. Would like if we could add a background of our own vs. having to just pick a color. Regardless though, a nice music app with other features not mentioned in my review.",
      "I like this app. But the only thing that I really wish it had was an easier, faster way to add songs to a playlist. Like, you open the playlist and then there's an option to add songs or something that will take you to all the songs you have downloaded and then you can just touch them to add them to the playlist. That would be really really nice and convenient.",
      "So far my experience has been 3.5 stars. My only issue is sometimes my songs or playlist just disappear. That can be annoying.",
      "Beautiful and lovely sound. But, it didn't take in all my music. I will still give it 5*. Pls, check it and find out why.",
      "Amazing app. Wouldn't have recommended it a year or two ago but now its perfect."

      "the decoding isnt fast enough. I really like the small window settings on the right. you can tap anywhere on the screen and accidentally hit the volume, skip ahead and brightness. those needs some more tunning. also need a side menu to save where u stopped rather than resetting back to the top. I have a s9 so I know how a video should look like when i play them. big thing is the decoding speed. also please add a button that will allow you to make the video to fit the screen size we watch on..",

      "Best floating app ever , the developer must be a real genius , I've tried so many apps in that type and wasn't realy happy with none of them , i always watch videos while doing other things on my tablet so finding this app really helped me to do some few works simultaneously cause it has all the options you need. Big thanks",
      "... and after testing about a 100 video players during the last 100 days, i finally got you Lua Player! the best since the good ol' VLC! 😉A KJ's buddy! 6 galleries of simultaneous videos at click to play are handed down flawlessly! 😍 It's now a \"must not forget to be installed member\" of all my Android gadgets collection. 101 🌟s and salute goes to the genius developer. Meticulously done and highly recommended, Cheers! 🍻👍😁👍",
      "I have been using it maybe a month now and have had no issues. I download movies/music & can play both with Lua. I can turn my screen off, it will still play. It auto pauses when you watch a YT video or a video in browser, then resumes as soon as the video stops. Which I like, I don't have to go back and press play. The picture in picture or the hovering screen is perfectly dimensioned and not too small.. You have to go into settings to turn the option to continue where you left off. Great apa!"

      "This is such a wonderful app!! My previous phone (LG V20) had all the equalizers you have here in it's default music app. One issue I've found is that the audio quality's much better when any song's playing in the background while I'm playing a game than when the song's in the background of any other non-game. Is this happening only with my phone? I've checked all battery and performance related settings and it's still the same. Give me an answer and I'll give ya the 5 stars you truly deserve",
      "I think this app is GREAT. Great job to the ones who made this app. I had an earphone with disgusting bass and all. Then I found this app, it's a big help to my earphone and the music it plays. Thank you soo much for this app. I'm only 15 but if I was a adult I would pay you so much money for this. Thank youuu.😂😊😊",
      "I appreciate the 3D Surround experience and the customizable EQ with a graphic effect in this app. But I have some concerns which are constantly disturbing me to enjoy this app. 1. The app closes the moment the phone screen sleeps. Really annoying. 2. To add songs to a playlist why not have a select tab to select whatever songs/folder to be added / deleted from the playlist tan go one by one. 3. There is no cross fade to enjoy back to back play. I am on full subs. Other apps work in sleep mode.",
      "P1500 for a lifetime license? you probably did not know root users can have much better sound experience than this thru viper4android.. and on playerstore only xplayer 3d can emulate that capability same clarity, 3d sound and good bass without root at half of your \"lifetime\" price.. i don't even feel the 3d virtual sound about this app and controls are very limited.",
      "Won't find local music in folders that the likes of PowerAmp and Omnia have no issues with, and there's no way to point the app to local music folders either. With much better options available this seems like a pointless app. In this case, MP3 and WMA audio files in a folder called \"Music\" with multiple sub-folders on an external SD card is completely ignored by Boom. The media is seen fine by PowerAmp, Omnia, VLC, GoneMad, Pi and is found by AZ Media Scanner."

I think it's about time I start looking for another music player app.👎",

I have an older version on a different device (version 3.2.1) and that has the music player controls widgit. This latest version only has an equalizer widgit. Would love to be able to switch between tracks from my home screen again on my new device. Please add the music player controls widgit back!!! So sad to see you are not adding it back in.",
      "It's rare for me to rate apps, but now I think it's necessary because am using this app for how many years already and it didn't fail me so far here's my suggestion if you'd like to care haha😁 first, i hope we can put a live wallpaper on the background. Second, i wish we can modify the text all around like change it fonts, colors etc. And lastly, it will be more great if you notice me😁",

Secondly last week the most watched sport site Max sports channels are not working. Seems the developers created it and let it go without support. I even tried to contact them but no response.",
      "Total waste of money! I have been paying for this app for a while, but when I want to watch mostly football always get this error: \"Error occurred when trying to play the media file. null\"",
      "The service is totally ruined. When switching channels there is a big delay. After 3-4 switchings the application completely stops working. What is going on. The support team doesn't respond at all. If this does not change and will opt out !!! No feedback at all. Is this good customer support?",
      "The app keeps breaking even when I'm on monthly subscription and pay regularly. Something has to be done, is just horrible to watch games or a movies. Come on guys, do something about it or i will just cancel my subscription.",
      "I am using the paid version and It was good, but I don't know what they did with this app. It started to switch very slow between channels (the delay is too long) and it crashes very often."

      "I'm not a huge fan of the surface interface, at least let us theme the text color so it's less in your face. But I only bought this app to play music while I'm on a call and it looks like it works great at task! If there were a way to login to streaming music services like Amazon through the app so we can stream while on a call, this app would be 👌🏼",
      "Like that it has a L-R balance which few have. Can't play the audio part of an Mp4 music video. The home screen list of folders is useless to me. Like many others it can't find my music for me but like that there is a file mgr type folder browse. The player functions are excellent but finding the main screen of the song playing is quirky. Suggest the author look at Bits Mp3 Player for a simpler way to navigate to places.",
      "Had this for years. Best sound control from any other player. The theft protection check is a bit much. I've gotten on flights and it's useless. I have to make sure it's active before boarding. Hope he thinks of another way. Many users seem to have problems but I've been good on my note 8. It sounds awesome at home with a Bluetooth link and my home audio system.",
      "This player deserves 5 stars, but the following issues are really bothering me, plus my mail to their help center is still un answered, for 3 weeks. The issues are 1. Cannot arrange the library in last modified mode, after scanning all the albums /artists gets shuffled, thus very difficult to pin point the lastest albums added, this issue happens in all modes, like artists. 2. Albums with multiple, collaborations, gets hayware and becomes individual albums or artists, this is highly irritating.",
      "The player and its library capabilities are nice. Love that I'm not marketed to and notified of things constantly. This is mostly why I picked this player (No marketing and ads). However, 2 annoyances are: 1) the music doesn't stop if you close the app. Especially annoying when it starts on it's own for whatever reason and you have to go search for the app on your phone then hit pause. 2) the app navigation is quirky. Not very fluid."
