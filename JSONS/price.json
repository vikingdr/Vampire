      "Pretty useful for keeping track of the best price for a given product. The quick comparison feature is useful too. Biggest flaw is that you can't edit the prices if the store changes it.",

      "Hands done the best comparison website available. It used to be 91 mobiles but smart prix has put in a lot of work and have improved their search interface and filters. Very easy to narrow down based on your requirements. Awesome work guys 👌👍 small suggestion, under laptops can you also include a search filter to filter models by graphics card. If I type the model name in the search box I don't get any relevant results",
      "This app is awsome but only theres is one issue ...i.e after scrolling much down if when we select a deal and go back then it comes back to 1st deal ...it becomes very hectic to again scroll and go back to again the same position",

I pick out the products I want to buy on the Price Tracker app and then I wait to be notified of a lower price by the app. I have used the app for a year now.

      "This app doesn't work at all. Devs have botched their job to the core. You will receive thousands of notification when prices don't change at all, simply because Amazon resets prices. And you won't receive notifications for real price changes cause their bot will set its base price to the new one, so it won't understand there is a change. GET AWAY FROM THIS APP.",

      "Filters not working on Android 9 unless I open in browser. the option is displayed but it draws up a blank window after displaying an ad. It also definitely NEEDS TO default to the price of goods that have succesfully sold. 80% of the listings are 400% higher than the actual value. Funkos currently listed for 25-30 bucks but when checking in browser and filtering to only display sold items reveals they successfully sell for five or six dollars.",
      "Used to be an OK app, but now shows too many long commercial ads a user is forced to watch. NO GOOD if you are out \"in the field\" trying to look up items quickly. Being forced to watch a 10 second or more ad after scanning every third or so barcode is very counter-productive to professional eBay sellers such as myself. Deleted this app to look for another scanner without these delays.",
      "Works well with a lot of advertising but it's a free app and it doesn't have a lot of bugs.",
      "Very helpful to get a guide on pricing. Thanks!",
      "Good app but the ebay tab should filter to items sold, not to what sellers are asking for a product. That gives a better idea of what items are actually worth."

      "Being a part of a family business in the HVAC industry with fuel delivery as one of our main focuses, this app is an invaluable source for where crude is trending and for relevant articles on oil. Love the app. Using it every day and throughout the day. If you are involved in anything related to oil, you need this app.",
      "Seems good. Would like the Indices layout to be a little more . . . Normal. Big tall squares with nothing but some small font in the middle. Thats weird. Using a Galaxy S8+. Seems like I have to do a couple extra taps to show Brent Crude. Its an oil price app not an oil news app. The price should be the default first thing to show up. But it isnt. Am I the only one that has left a rating? Double weird.",
      "Decent app to get reasonably current oil prices. It runs well with no big issues. Lack of dashboard control means I have to do extra tapping to get access to the relevant data and can't bury the stuff I don't care about. Lack of widget support greatly reduces the usefulness of this app for me. I would also like to be able to launch articles to my preferred browser.",
      "Gave it 4 stars initially, felt that was not fair, came back and gave it 5 because the app is really quite brilliant. The reason I gave it a '4' initially was because I'd prefer to see no advertising even if I had to pay for the privilege. I don't see an option to do so, but I guess the developer has a reason to structure it this way. And, I'll admit that the advertising is relatively discreet. So, there you go. 👍",
      "Very helpful. Spot prices for major trading index plus ability to add specific markets of interest, i.e. East Texas Sweet, Natural Gas . Access to relevant articles in the app saves search time. Alerts customizable for prices or percentage change: excellent feature!"

Every seller can ask for an individual price for any item. But if you don't know the value for that item, you also have no idea if you would pay too much for it! So it's crucial for you to know the average value, not the average asked price.\r\nThere's where the Auction Price Finder comes in handy. The price checker app calculates the average value for your item based on the last sales - not on the currently asked prices. In that way, you get a price which is closer to the real value of the item. This average price can now help you to decide if something is sold at a bargain price, or if the asked price is way too high.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHow to check a price\r\n\r\nThe usage of the price finder is pretty simple. \r\nJust open the search form, enter the name of your item (or use the barcode scanner), select your country and tab GO. The auction price finder then checks the last sold items on ebay and calculates the average price for you. \r\n\r\nThe price check is for both, sold auctions and sold Buy It Now - items. \r\n\r\nThe calculated prices are shown on the result page. You may then scroll down, to take a closer look on the search result details. There you'll see a summary of the prices, which were used for the calculation of the average value. \r\nThe \"price range for Auctions\" shows all used prices of the sold auction items, and the \"price range for BuyItNow\" shows all found prices of the sold Buy It Now – items (ordered from lowest to highest price).\r\nThe price ranges also display the calculated average prices. So you can quickly see, how many items have been sold for a price near the average price.\r\nBelow the price ranges you see a third graph. This is the summary of how much sold items where used for the calculation. Please notice that your search results are more accurate, the more items were included in the calculation of the average selling price.\r\n\r\nIf you swipe once to the right, you'll see the found categories for your search request. You can tap on one of them, to search further in the selected category. \r\nThe next two pages showing the items which were used for the price calculation (Auctions and BuyItNow). You can tap on one item, to open it on ebay and take a closer look at the details. \r\n\r\nThe last page shows all the excluded items. These are the ones, which were too cheap or too expensive. You can also tap on one of them, to open them on ebay.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFurther functions of the price finder:\r\n\r\n- select the maximum results per request (25, 50, 100 or 200)\r\n- use a price range for your request\r\n- exclude shippingfees\r\n\r\n---- new functions added by updates ----\r\n\r\nversion 2.1:\r\n- exclude words from search\r\n- open active auctions\r\n--> Now where you know the value of your item, you know how much you can spend on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nversion 1.7:\r\n- barcode scanner \r\n--> Perfect to check the price for games, cds, books and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nversion 1.4:\r\n- optional search in active BuyItNow items\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can select between the following countries:\r\n\r\n- Germany\r\n- United States\r\n- Canada\r\n- UK\r\n- Australia\r\n- Austria\r\n- Belgium\r\n- France\r\n- Italy\r\n- Netherlands\r\n- Spain\r\n- Switzerland\r\n- Ireland\r\n- Malaysia\r\n- Philippines\r\n- Poland\r\n- Singapore\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease notice that the application is a private project, which is in no way related to eBay Inc. in any manner.",

      "I don't get the point of this app. I tried to use it for price comparison to build a shopping list but that wasn't feasible. You can't limit your search to stores within a certain distance so you have to search each product to see if it's available at your favorite stores. You can't compare prices based on nutrition so there's no way of comparing based on the true value of the products. It's faster and easier for me to look up the prices and labels online and compare on my own.",
      "This app is a brilliant concept. I feel like I'm always wondering if I'm getting the best deal at a particular grocery store or if the store I'm going to will carry the item that I need to purchase. There are a few flaws, 1. Since its user data driven local stores don't always have prices in the app and aren't represented. 2. Some produce comes up separated by different quantities. sweet potatoes can come up as each, per pound, per 3-lb bag. I wish this was consolidated and convertible.",
      "This is a complete waste of time, there are so many glitches. It won't save any filters that you apply. They're too many options for each food item.",
      "*Will not let me view Entire List and I am on my way to the store!* Needs improvement! I like this app when comparing exact brand item between stores when I am brand specific but PLEASE make it so one can compare prices across all store for non-brand specifics especially when stores have their own brand names. For example: 2% Milk, Grade A Medium Eggs, Orange Juice. I want rock bottom prices on every item. Also, when I click on Fav Stores, just include pricing for my fav stores. Thanks!",
      "Ehhh..... app not saving changes when I select no substitutions. Made list with multiple items and when comparing price items on list dissapeared...frustrating"

      "I've used a few scanners to determine what to price an item for on eBay. This app is really nice as it works very quickly and takes shipping costs into account. It also looks at sold items, so you know what an item is going for, what it costs to ship, and if it has sold recently. There are a few more items that would be great to have in a scanner like this - I would pay for those features. When selling an item on eBay, eBay collects between 10 and 12% depending on item. PayPal takes 30 cents per transaction. PayPal also takes 2.9% per transaction. It would be great if you could go into settings and configure those options so you'd have a much closer idea of what your potential profit could be. Right now, I'd need to use the app to see what an item goes for, then subtract 15% or so for eBay and PayPal costs, then subtract item cost to get an idea of what profit would be. It would be slick if the app just took that 15% and 30 cents out up front.",
      "Takes a bit of trial and error to figure out the specifics of finding the info you want but it will quickly give you a approximate guide to a price of what your searching. In the end though it still comes down to its worth what someone will pay. If the app gave info on where you would sell an item for the price given then that would be great, if the app acted as a go between for seller and buyer (for a small fee of course) that would make it outstanding.",
      "Im not a fan of the app yes it functions and you can type in a description but the problem is you dont know if it is correct because there is no picture to identify that it is the right item. Multiple catergories come up as well again making it hard to determine what category it would belong to as sellers may list the same item in one category and another seller might list it in a different one. Im just unable to use it.",
      "This app is without a doubt the best app I've ever downloaded...simple to use..very fast and accurate...before u post for sale on Ebay or any other sales apps ...do yourself a huge favor and price ur item on here...let's you know how much , when, how many others ,best time of the monthe to sell for max money...going yard saleing... dont leave home without it...best easiest EVER",
      "It has alot of very useful info. I'm still figuring it out but I can see I will be relying on its accuracy. Thanks great app! I just wanted to mention I wish it was a tiny bit more illiterate user friendly. For such as myself 🤔"

      "App works well for me, and I like the lay-out, so 5 stars for that. But the quotes are delayed by like a 1/2 hour. This limits its effectiveness greatly. Its fine for the casual market watcher with no skin in the game, but for investors who need live quotes, it's not much good. Get it together, Kitco. Make it live. 1 star for actual accuracy. Average 3 stars in total.",
      "It is a very good app. I really like it. Sometimes it's a little bit slow to open a page. A suggestion... to add the subtitle option for news in video for some people with hearing impairment. Thank you",
      "Nice app. The widget size is too big, though. 2x3 is too large for more than 2 widgets on my home screen. Will continue to use it, but please consider changing that.",

Also there is a refresh button it says reset at the top you have to actually take a look at the app not just write a review. Since downloading this app I have saved over $25 definitely give the app five stars.",

I don't mind buying an unlock key, but subscribing to edit the date is ridiculous. You can't add multiple brands for the same product, which is essential for comparing prices. You have to start typing in a store name before the list shows up. It should just be a drop down menu. I didn't use it much, so I'm probably missing things. But a subscription cost for such a basic app is a complete deal breaker. Obviously the market for this is people who are trying to save money...",

People may say “That’s not gold - it’s yellow!” They ain’t wrong. <br><br>Send tips, bugs, ironic things, or suggested color palettes to android@goodrx.com.",

      "What a wonderful app!! So happy with the prices. More than half the price of my insurance. I'm on Medicare and could not afford my prescriptions. I either had to do without or cut dose in half. It is so nice to have an alternative to the insurance and prescription drug companies that gouge prices just to line their pockets! Hopefully your app will cause some heartache to those theives who have been putting it to the little guy for decades. I recommend this app to everyone I know. Thank you again",
      "Very helpful for saving money. Make sure you check with individual pharmacies before transferring your prescription. For instance, Fred Meyer will only let you fill ONE prescription. And once you've chosen that particular prescription, you cannot add another prescription to their \"profile\" at Fred Meyer. Even if you don't ever need refills again. Personally, I don't think they are living up to their arrangement with Good Rx, and should not be allowed to participate. But the app is TERRIFIC!",
      "This app saved me more than half off of my first prescription. I would recommend this app to anyone that wants to save money on prescriptions. It is easy to use. I simply show the coupon from my phone to the pharmacist and that is it. Simple. I was a little worried that pharmacies would frown upon receiving a coupon and the added work to process. However, it appears to be seemless for them to enter as well and quick.",
      "Great Application. Allows you to find stores near you with prices similar to having insurance. I couldn't believe the great prices and this is just with the GOOD RX App. You save even more for a current price of $5.99 a month with over a Thousand participating Pharmacies like Costco, CVS and more. Unfortunately Walgreens, Walmart and Sam's aren't on the Gold List but are on Standard Good RX card. Right now I just use the free version but soon will probably opt in on the RX Gold.",
      "This is probably the easiest app I have ever used!!! They have saved my husband and i so much money. I stopped my prescription coverage thru medicare because they doubled. I take 3 pills a month and didnt need it. Then my husband had a hear attack. Goodrx saved us about $125 on all four of his subscriptions. 😊"

The app can tell you the prices in many different currencies, incl. Of course US dollar, Euros, Pounds Sterling and many others. Prices are updated frequently so you'll always get the very latest price. The app is easy to use and has other features such as gold/silver price charts from previous hours, days, weeks, months etc. 5/5",
      "It stopped working. The price hasnt updated since 10/2 and today is 10/7. When it worked I loved the widget. Hopefully if it starts working again I'll be able to update my review.",
      "Simple and great reliable app! Very easy to use interface. It does what it's supposed to do and always has the current prices for you.",

Would be 5 stars if you could sync prices with a certain exchange as i have to open coinbase to double check as it never quite matches but as mentioned does the job. Thanks for the response Dev, I get that and appreciate any future updates.",

    "title":"Forex Price Alerts",
    "description":"A Forex trading tool that generates alerts when a pre-defined Forex price level is reached.\r\n\r\nIdeal for technical traders waiting for key price levels to be reached.\r\n\r\nForex price alert triggers can be set on the bid or ask price. Uses Google's messaging service. The App doesn't need to be running in order to receive an alert. \r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* REAL TIME STREAMING DATA - Uses a dedicated, reliable real-time Forex price feed.\r\n* BID AND ASK TRIGGERS - Set a price trigger on either the Bid or Ask price.\r\n* TOUCH-PAD ENTRY - Quickly set / Adjust price levels using swipe gestures.\r\n* SORTING - Sort by trigger distance, symbol, or manually sort pending alerts\r\n* SUPPORT FOR OREO's (8.0+) ADVANCED NOTIFICATION FEATURES \r\n\r\n\r\nPremium version:\r\n\r\n* UNLIMITED ALERTS\r\n* 30+ FOREX PAIRS - Including Metals and USD Index.\r\n* CUSTOM TEXT MESSAGE - Describe what the alert means.\r\n* LONG DURATION ALERTS SOUNDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ's\r\n\r\nQUESTION: What's the difference between the Free and Premium version?\r\n\r\nANSWER: The Free version has less Forex pairs, and has a limited total number of pending alerts. However the Free version has no Ads, and uses the same real-time price feed and other features. The free version is fine if you mostly trade major Forex pairs and only require a few pending alerts at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Can I make the alert sound a custom ringtone?\r\n\r\nANSWER: Yes, but only for Android 8.0 (Oreo) and above. Earlier versions of Android don't support ringtone tone sounds for notifications.\r\n\r\nTo add a custom ringtone notification sound, you'll first need to add your custom ringtone file to the downloads/notifications folder. Then go to the App's Settings / Sounds and select your custom ringtone from the list. Custom ringtones provide a way to create longer duration alert sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Is the Forex price data real-time or delayed?\r\n\r\nANSWER: The Forex quotes are real-time, for both the free and premium versions. \r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Does the App need to be running to receive an alert?\r\n\r\nANSWER: No. The App uses Google's messaging service. Our server continually checks your alerts and will send a notification message to your device if the trigger condition is reached.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: I set an alert, but didn't receive a message when it was triggered.\r\n\r\nANSWER: There could be several reasons. Firstly, go to Android settings, and make sure that notifications are enabled for the App. Also make sure your device is not in a silent mode, and the volume isn't muted.\r\n\r\nMessages are sent from Google's messaging server. If your device has poor signal quality, or the network connection between Google's servers and your device is disrupted for some reason, there's a chance the message won't be received.\r\n\r\nSo to ensure reliability, make sure your device has a stable internet connection, and is using a good quality ISP.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Does the App run in split screen mode\r\n\r\nANSWER: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems, please contact us at support, and we'll help you out. To contact us, go to the App's menu and click \"Contact Support\"",

Doesnt have any intrustive ads. Cant even recsll seeing any. One improvement I'd love to see is the categories turned into buttons or sim. Instead of having switch between core ones or scroll all discounts, it would be great if I could just deselect alcohol, pet supplies etc to only see the products of use to me."

      "What a wonderful app!! So happy with the prices. More than half the price of my insurance. I'm on Medicare and could not afford my prescriptions. I either had to do without or cut dose in half. It is so nice to have an alternative to the insurance and prescription drug companies that gouge prices just to line their pockets! Hopefully your app will cause some heartache to those theives who have been putting it to the little guy for decades. I recommend this app to everyone I know. Thank you again",
      "Very helpful for saving money. Make sure you check with individual pharmacies before transferring your prescription. For instance, Fred Meyer will only let you fill ONE prescription. And once you've chosen that particular prescription, you cannot add another prescription to their \"profile\" at Fred Meyer. Even if you don't ever need refills again. Personally, I don't think they are living up to their arrangement with Good Rx, and should not be allowed to participate. But the app is TERRIFIC!",
      "This app saved me more than half off of my first prescription. I would recommend this app to anyone that wants to save money on prescriptions. It is easy to use. I simply show the coupon from my phone to the pharmacist and that is it. Simple. I was a little worried that pharmacies would frown upon receiving a coupon and the added work to process. However, it appears to be seemless for them to enter as well and quick.",
      "Great Application. Allows you to find stores near you with prices similar to having insurance. I couldn't believe the great prices and this is just with the GOOD RX App. You save even more for a current price of $5.99 a month with over a Thousand participating Pharmacies like Costco, CVS and more. Unfortunately Walgreens, Walmart and Sam's aren't on the Gold List but are on Standard Good RX card. Right now I just use the free version but soon will probably opt in on the RX Gold.",
      "This is probably the easiest app I have ever used!!! They have saved my husband and i so much money. I stopped my prescription coverage thru medicare because they doubled. I take 3 pills a month and didnt need it. Then my husband had a hear attack. Goodrx saved us about $125 on all four of his subscriptions. 😊"

      "App and service don't offer a robust enough search engine. Simple keyword searches many times return all kinds of items not related to your search. No way to filter or be more specific. For example, search for Old Raby. It's an old hunt club. Searching for this returns everything from Rabies to Rabbis. In any other search engine, one could tighten this up by adding quotes around the search terms, but this search engine doesn't do that. It just returns the same results.",
      "Typing into the search line is hopeless. The app randomly tells me I can't see the price because I don't have a subscription even though I'm logged in with a subscription. You need to do more beta testing before releasing an app that could potentially frustrate thousands of users. Worthpoint, if you know what is good for your business, put 10 people on fixing it today and you could be releasing a usable app within a week.",

It throws away your search. I guess if you want greysheet data you may be forced to use print - in the internet age.",

      "Don't download unless you want to wait weeks for a payment. They should have never changed it to card number. It takes well over a week now when the old way was just a day or two. It's better to just use the discount from gas station cards now. It's a shame because this has potential. Edit: Why do u say contact ur email when u don't respond? I made this purchase March 5. Contacted March 16. Just to get a email on March 21 saying to provide proof of purchase. Obviously card check in doesn't work",
      "I like the app. I can't wait till I can use it at some grocery stores and restaurants in my area! Update, I've been using the app for several months now and I have actually gotten a fair amount of money back. But I have also encountered a lot of errors or glitches which have caused me to not get credit for MANY purchases. I tried sending a message today. We'll see how that goes. And the recent switch to the pre registered or check in system lends more confusion to me than service. Almost great.",
      "so far this app is great made almost $30 in less than a month. I have not cashed it out yet so I don't know how smooth that part is but I'm extremely happy to be getting paid for something I do every day. \"Update\" Well apparently if you change cards through your bank or use your a friend's/family members card. I was up to $340 and I'm locked out indefinitely. Just try not to make too much money and you guys should be fine.",
      "Used to be perfect until a couple days ago. Now all of a sudden when I try to upload my receipt, whether I take a picture of it or upload it from galley, the app crashes. It used to work perfectly fine up until for me, March 14th and now I can't even upload my receipt. Please fix this immediately so I can start saving again!",
      "This app works like advertised. After you claim your offer, you pay full price at the pump and then get a reward once you upload your receipt. They are working on no longer needing to upload your receipt, just check in and use a past card. It all depends on where you live, but where I live, there are a good number of gas stations that are competitively (within 1 -2 cents) of the stations around them. Highly recommend."

Please update this for all catagorys according to the official website of UK ebay and then your app will be the only app on Google play store that is correct as all the other apps are wrong too. When is your next update it has been over 1 year? Did you stop updating the app?",
      "Idea is not new but kudos for making an app. However the design of the app defeats the purpose - speed. You just need to have 4 boxes that will be used for input or output of information depending on which of the 3 boxes are filled in. All the other stuff should be in settings or below if you like. I have made in excel and loading it on the phone and using takes way less time than this app. Make the extra expenses optionally as %. You also need add local taxes - shipping & puchase price.",
