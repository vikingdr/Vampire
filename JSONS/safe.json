When I transferred my money from account to account I don't know if it is my phone, but it will \"load my new account balance.\" And load and load, where I have to close out and log in again.",
      "(3/12/20)So last month the app wouldnt stop crashing. Now for 2 day the login features arent working. I can't log in at all. I log in at the website no problem so all my login info is corect. Plus, my finger print hasn't changed either.",
      "Not only its so easy an simple its so convinient . Perfact app for keeping track of your spending. But most of all the people at the branch are wonderful and always ready to help you. Safe Credit is the best, always reconmending to my friends and family.",
      "Picture feature is cumbersome but app great otherwise. Cannot zoom in to confirm picture, , could use easier interface to manually capture. 1/24/2020 still cumbersome with no zoom to verify clarity of picture. Multiple attempts required due to system not recognizing amount of payee. Same check format as all previous deposits. 2/11/20. After multiple deposits, process still very repetitive to confirm picture.",

      "Awesome, I've had zero issues because I can read pretty well and all of the features/drawbacks are pretty well explained and fairly obvious. Haven't lost any photos and the cloud service has brought me through multiple phones. Would definitely recommend. I've had the premium sube for a few years now. $25 a year isn't much to support something you like.",
      "READ BEFORE YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!! Pictures I had saved, even from years ago on separate devices all got deleted. I know they synced because they had been saved for years most of them. There's nothing left now. Have spoken to Developers and Customer service. Told them the issue well over five times and have still been waiting hours for a response back. I suggest using a different app and boycotting this app before they lose all your pictures and play dumb afterwards.",
      "It never fails me but at times it clutters the files. When I access the individual files they don't follow the preview arrangement and others seem unnecessarily repeated! The database could be corrupting the arrangement or something like that. Otherwise, it's the best of it's kind. No competition.",
      "The app doesn't reveal any content in it as you open it and it hides all the saved pictures. Nothing is shown at all. Keeping on opening it and closing it back and forth for hours but didn't work. - EDIT - Just editted my review from 2 stars to 4 stars after the problem or the glitch resolved. I may not be too bitchy about it, just hoping not to lose my pics on this app.",
      "Do NOT download; boycot this app and any other app from this developer. They subscribe you to premium trial without your knowledge, when the trial period runs out, they hold your photos hostage in an effort to try to make you pay for the app. I had to delete an album with 3 photo that the app rendered inactive so I could not export them. The app gave me a pop-up telling to upgrade to premium else I will lose 4 fotos. I am NOT kidding you. Andmore frustration the app put you through try to expor"

But I installed it again and try to put my password . My all data were recovered . Thank you very much. Really useful and trusted app.",
      "Lots of potential. Calculator is clunky, vault is good, but ads are invasive. $15 for a lifetime premium is a pretty hefty asking price for an app that can't generate video thumbnails or play video files natively. Probably one of the better options on the play store, but the price VS product will leave me looking elsewhere.",

      "Amazing app to hide \"revealing\" pictures or videos, really does work just like a calculator and unless you know the codes then you could never get in or even begin to realize its hiding something, been on my phone for like 2yrs and my old lady still hasn't found anything 😂😂"

I have to click on that, then it asks which browser I want to open it with and whether that's a one-time use or every time. Then it goes to the sign-in page. I thought it would go away after the first or second use, but it hasn't and I can't find a way to go straight to the app without that garbage every time. It's annoying and I hate it.",

I need to see my accounts every day and it has been 3 days now with out it. Should have made sure everything was set up on this new app for your customers before deactivating the other mobile app. Very disappointed!! Dont even deserve one star!!",
      "Very poor execution. Lost all transfers and family account viewing. What was wrong with the old system? If you were going to update you should have had all the same features as the old system, and made sure they weren't removed so your customers wouldnt have to go back and make sure things were back in place as far as their transfers. Way to go backwards...",

Also, upon entering site I was able to activate fingerprint recognition. 2nd edit: have been advised that multiple accounts are no longer able to be managed by mobile app. This is a downgrade from the previous app, a much appreciated service lost. My star rating reflects my disappointment in SAFE's \"Forward Vision\" upgrade.",

      "Real time location is not real time. Have to leave app then return in order to see current location. Doesn't move with the phone you're tracking. Sprint Family Locator was so much better than this app. Not happy at all especially for what it's costing me a month for two phones. Please go back to Sprint Family Locator!!!! Sincerely, Unhappy User",
      "Love the app, like the new improvements. Is there a trick on turning OFF the ringing when you are trying to locate the phone. It goes off forever....more than the 2 mins and doesnt give me the option to stop it anymore. I have to manually turn off the volume and restart the phone.",
      "Regularly can not find my daughter's apple iPhone. She insists she is not turning off GPS, and it rarely locates her phone. My son has an Android... never has a problem. Have issue with my wife's iPhone (same model) as well, but not as many, so makes it difficult to troubleshoot. Usually trying to see what her ETA is for school events when trying to locate her... hopefully we never rely on it in an emergency. If it doesn't consistently and reliably locate devices, what's the point?",
      "This thing sucks so bad! I have to keep re-regestering my devices. It fails to locate most of the time, even if the devices are side by side. Family locator was %100 better, and they did away with it. This is no where near worth the $10 per month fee! I'm sick of it!",
      "The app has improved significantly over the last year. I like the real time location feature especially. I'm still not sure why we need two modes of seeing people across the bottom vs one with more functionality. Also, the app stays on my notifications drop down all the time now with some sort of battery saving mode warning and won't let me dismiss it."

      "With app working in Android OS 10, good news. The cameras still have issues with slow reaction time, deceivingly low battery life, and failures to catch and record activities that are too fast or happen again right after recording (ex: a man stands still for 5 sec before next move). Seriously, once you briefly appear and wait out of sight for a few seconds and then come back , the camera wont event record any of it.",
      "The app is fine. Dont care too much for the \"Improved\" modes. In terms of performance. The camera is always offline when I want to look at it. Takes an age to load. Don't try to use it if you want to see anything in real time. I have the motion sensor set up to the highest setting and if you walk past even slowly, it won't kick in until after you are past it. Is a pretty expensive dummy camera.",
      "Concept is good and it works but I get a notification late sometimes and then when I go into the app it hangs on the title page for about 10 seconds. That needs to go and I'll re review the app. This is not a free app remember. I paid for it with the hardware. I don't need your branding on my phone when there is someone at my front door.",
      "Device is reported as offline more often than not. It has a full battery (plugged in to solar panel) and has good Wi-Fi signal. Unsure if it is due to being offline our because the motion detection is unreliable but the camera misses a lot of people using the gate it is aimed at.",
      "Believe all of the other negative reviews, this is the worst app I have ever used. On top of the app being horrible, the tech support is almost non existent... by almost I mean they answered the phone in Pakistan and asked me a few very simple questions, that led to the conclusion it is my router's fault even though the signal is better now than the 2 days it worked properly...2 whole days.

      "It was only a few days ago I complained this app locked up. Even when I turned off my internet access, waited, then reingaged again. I loaded the app and it worked for two (2) days and locked up again. Prior to the past month (like for 2 years), this app was never failing. I'm giving it one more chance then it's over. Like I said before \"Why it stops working and locks up ... your guess is as good as mine.\"",
      "This app isn't worth the time to install. Naturally it's going to shut off when leaving the router, but when returning, same router, it won't restart automatically or manually. Had to uninstall then install, then it will work until I leave again , then the process starts over. Did this 5 times in 3 hours. They think I'm going to pay monthly for this? Don't think so until it gets fixed.",
      "Not working properly for me. I don't use public WiFi often, but had to manually turn it on when I did. For me this is a minor annoyance, but what really bothers me is that it doesn't shut off when connected to trusted networks. As one would expect, the bandwidth is negatively affected when it's active (and some apps won't work at all), so I have to manually go in and shut it down. Not just turn off the protection, but shut it down in the app's settings. A VPN app needs to work properly.",
      "50/50 chances at best. Most of the time it will not turn on no matter how many times I reinstall it, airplane mode, restart phone, etc. It worked great at home. While traveling, it will not work anywhere in Taiwan and Vietnam. \"IF\" it does turn green for once, it turns off through the night, leaving your phone doing stuff unsecure on internet. I spent 4 hours on the phone with tech support before we left trying to get iPhone X app to work. No go! IT IS NOT RELIABLE !!! WHO KNOWS IF IT IS SECURE",
      "Same issue as the previous comment. It used to work, but now it does not. If you want to hypnotize yourself waiting for the app to activate, then I would give this broken app 5 stars. Only way I can get it to work is to delete it and re-install it, every time I want the feature for a secure Wi-Fi."

      "Excellent app and prompt and professional backup service. Have been using this app for many years and has worked perfectly. Recently I lost my database as I was running an old version on my Samsung Galaxy phone and Samsung did a system upgrade which somehow made the database inaccessible. I wrote to Robert and within minutes he answered me and helped me get my database back simply by updating my version. Highly recommend this app.",
      "Just excellent...I have been shopping for a solid password application, settled on this one and so glad I did. You will find others, but the price is crazy. Notice they don't show price up front, with many a recurring monthly charge..$$$... Here they are upfront, it's a very nominal fee for loads of options, and I have been very pleased with layout. I like the fact I'm not storing my info in someone's cloud. Very easy to work within app and I highly recommend!",
      "This app is exactly what I want. Simple, and easy to use compared to others, not a lot of complicated settings to wade through, private to my device and so far it always works. I do my own device \"SYNCHRONIZATION\" by manually backing up my database to the cloud where it is accessible and downloadable from my other devices. I have tried others and sometimes try others but I keep coming back to Password Safe. It may not be everyones solution but it is perfect for me.",
      "Excellent password manager that is build with real security in mind! You can easily tell the author really thought the entire app through. My only request - please keep digging around Android and other vendors' specific security features (e.g. Knox), and make this app even more secure. To me this password manager is nearly perfect. Maybe it misses occasional bounty hunts, so that external pentesters could audit the app better.",
      "This is the ultimate secure app in that it doesn't sync with any online platforms so there's no chance of it being hacked, but that's also why it's a bit inconvenient because you can only access it from your phone (or wherever it's downloaded). I love it though because it's extremely useful for my baby brain (postpartum). Highly recommended!!"

      "Refreshingly different from other apps. I wanted somewhere safe for making simple notes and life goals etc. This does that without complicating things. The app is pin protected and I can have different colour notes with the option of secure online access. I've used Evernote before but this app is much better. Thank you for providing the important things without gimmicks. Would recommend.",
      "Amazing app, easy to use and fully customizable. The password protection is princess. Maybe if the future they'll add the option in setting to auto lock notes on exit, right now you have to remember to do it manually. But that isn't a big deal for me. Moreover it's free and ad free, so thank you developer for making this app and sharing it with everyone with no strings attached.",
      "The only problem I have with this app is I cannot attach pictures to the notes. Sometimes I will screen shot information that I need but can't put it in a note for later and future use. I will be uninstalling this app as soon as I find a notes app that will allow me to lock my notes (which this one does) and attach pictures.",
      "Good potentials. In setting there should be an option to auto lock note on exit. As the app is lock note, is it appropriate to have the option to leave it unlocked. I'm short, encryption and auto lock should be by default. To speed process, finger print access to app can be employed. A 2nd finger encryption can be used to lock and unlock notes . Good luck.",
      "Great, but I am concerned about the security level of the App-locking PIN; why only numbers? A string of numbers on their own makes a very weak password. Yes, you can add a strong password/passphrase to each note, but what about the titles/names you give to each note?... these get revealed by only typing in a sequence of numbers to open the app. There should, at least, be an 'option' in the settings to allow the user to choose a simple PIN or a more secure password/passphrase. Safe and secure?"

I just downloaded this a week ago and realized after moving 25 pics to it that now my camera folder in Google photos is missing hundreds or thousands of photos. I even paid for the or version. Disgusted.",
      "pictures are automatically shuffled, so to speak, when you import more than one at a time. this does not work well for me when i have a gallery of 150 images i need to keep in exact order. albums are impossible to delete also. i hope these oversights are fixed soon as this is actually the best vault app i can find",
      "Great app security wise, but there are three main frustrating parts to this; 1. Sometimes it doesn't load in media correctly or can't load it at all 2. Some pictures can't be zoomed in at all 3. Sometimes video playback closes after a few seconds",
      "Do not waste money on the pro version, it does not work. The ios version works well, but wireless sync option doesn't work with the Android version (Android 10), you drag files over and they refuse to be uploaded."

I don't want to get rid of this game, please fix these issues. Update- Since it still hasn't been fixed, or even acknowledged, I've dropped my rating. If something doesn't happen soon I'll be uninstalling. Problem happened when you changed the game. Doesn't level up or get cash. Could you fix this soon?",
      "Guys if you are reading this great game, awesome time killer. However with the reset it gave me a legendary gun, and kept all my cash on level 1. What I enjoyed most about the older version is the grind of trying to find a better weapon. Guess I'll have to wait and see when I get back up to lvl 2520. 5 stars for the original just not sure about the new one yet.",
      "Hey guys, this new update is confusing, I am at lv 646, well around that area now I'm back to lv 1? Like comeon guys I have to kill and upgrade all over again? It kinda annoying the first time, the 2nd time is just plane dumb....Also is there a way that u guys can make upgrading ezier like if I can just hold down the upgrade it will automatically do the job for me rather than clicking it 1 by 1",
      "Updated for me on 2/27/20. Started me back on level 1, but gave me a great weapon to get caught back up. Also gave me all the money I needed to get my skill set back to where I was. Edit- Got back to where I was and gaining levels again, but won't give me any more money. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars again.",
      "Waste of time! The newest update completely ruins the game. There is absolutely no challenge in being forced to replay from the start and no chance to progress player level or skills! What a slap in the face to loyal players!"

This app needs more user friendly parental control including control of the kids devices volume. This app has many features however you need to find time look through everything. Make it user friendly, identifiable tabs on quick glance and key options up front. Give me the option to duplicate profile setting for kids",
      "Stupid app! My 5 year old child deleted the app accidentally when she was deleting another! It also took ages for my children to receive texts and allowed to be playing on their device's again. Super Slow! Do not install! I would rate this zero if I had the chance but the lowest is one! I would rate it a 5 if YOU FIX THESE PROBLEMS!!!!",
      "Kids easily bypass. Just yesterday found go incognito on web browser, search app click install without having to go to Google play store. I locked Google play store to prevent new apps. Also Samsung S7 multiscreen allows child to bypasses security completely. Probably assumes only one screen is open and only locks 1 of the multi screens. Assume macafee cant see other screen. An easy complete bypass. Even with the latest updates. Also kids just reply using notification screen to bypass app locks",
      "It was great at first. It doesn't have all capabilities with an iPhone which wasn't to big of a deal with us. I tried to get this on my daughter's computer which it said that it could but we never got it done. After the trial period I tried to set up paying month by month payments. They took my money but I cannot access the app!!! I have emailed with no response. I guess that is $8 I will never see again."

      "It is turning on automatically without my permission. The setting is \"When I turn the protection on\"",
      "From my disappointing experience with McAfee Safe Connect this app is a total waste of money. A definite Don't Buy. Works on my Moto G6 Android phone but simply refuses to start on my new HP laptop running Windows 10. The exact same problem faced by a poster below who has been waiting since February 1 for a fix from support. I've filed a complaint but 8 days on zero progress.So can't use my laptop. As a journalist I need a safe connection but this product doesn't provide it. Money back please! UPDATE: Problem fixed by remote access engineer. The following day I was back to square one, again with no protection. Disappointing as the engineer was most helpful and gave me a short extension to my one-year contract in lieu of nearly a month without protection .But all the goodwill in the world is little use if the product has a problem on Windows 10."

      "More reliable than Google maps. It's installed on all our family phones. Love the fact that you can watch someone as they move to their destination. Google maps just sporadically jumps from one location to the other. With this app you can see your loved one move along their destination. Great little app though the \"I love you\" remark you can send is a little cheesy.",
      "The app works well to a point, set was very easy. But once up and going it will tell you someone has left a location they haven't left and you can still see on the map they are there. Example mom has left home but mom is at home asleep...lol may need to get this portion of the app looked at and working properly before it confuses elderly people.",
      "I Really Like this App More than i Thought Because It is Way Better than I thought . Also I Just wanted to Update that your App is Amazingly Helpful for me to help my Fiancee Locate his phone because he has forgotten were he has put his phone down at . But I ALSO wanted to Ask You now my Safe 360 App has No Issues However My Fiancee's App Keeps sending me Several MESSAGES saying that my Fiancee Hasn't been heard from . What can I do to fix this????",
      "Loved this app and then my husband had to reset his phone and the tracker asks him to type in a code and we never get the code. Trying to find a app similar to this but no luck right now. We contacted support about the code issue and they said there working on it. Well it's been 18 plus days now. Sucks a good app now I cant use.",
      "This was great at first. But lately, for some reason, when I exit the app, my location stops updating. This happens even if the app is actually running in the background. I hope you guys can fix this."

      "Personally, I've loved brave and have been a staunch supporter for quite some time now, however, this is the third time I've uninstalled and redownloaded in an attempt to fix random bugs. Previously, it refused to load most webpages. Now, it refused to download PDFs. Further, if the devs see this and can please bring back the old view for the tabs list, it would be much appreciated. I really do want to continue supporting BAT and changing the ad experience, but I can't do that if I can't use it",
      "First of all thanks to the brave team for creating such a nice app. Have been using the app for quite some time now and it hasn't disappointed me much. I would like to suggest a few addables; 1. Please enable night mode 2. Add backward/forward arrow buttons next to each other (without having to tap three dots). 3. Add grid view while selecting tabs. Please add them if it's within your business compliance. Thanks.",
      "The 'find on page' option is annoying. When you search for something, it scrolls to it, it doesn't directly go to it. This can get extremely time consuming if your webpage is really long and you're searching for a lot of things. Please try to give an option to turn off the scroll. EDIT: I have been using this browser for a while but I'm highly concerned and disappointed at the number of ads. I downloaded this browser for the promise of no ads. I'm gonna try to look for a new browser.",
      "I love this browser but there's a problem, I'm not sure if it's a device specific problem or not. It does however only occur on my Android device, the PC version is flawless. The trouble is; whenever I open Brave on my Android for the first time in a while, the browser starts hanging up. It continues to lock up and hang in 2 to 5 second intervals for several minutes at random. Eventually the hanging will come mostly to a stop and everything will start working as expected. Any fix for this?",
      "The latest update broke some functionalities. Some videos on mobile Facebook site will start playing then stop by itself. You can't even seek to play them again. Restart doesn't help. Doesn't happen with other browser. The tap and hold gesture on Facebook mobile site doesn't work sometimes and you need to restart the browser for it to work. Background video playback will stop working and you've got to disable and enable it again to work. I believe bugs were inevitable with these rushed updates."

      "Great app. Actually best boda app in Uganda so far. Only issue is that despite having the safe boda wallet many boda riders refuse to accept credit especially at night making the wallet ineffective. Otherwise, it's a very good app. 👌",
      "I really love Safeboda, it is affordable and very convenient. However, I have two issues that need to be addressed. One is that, the app sometimes just hangs or stops working for no reason. I am not sure if it is a bug but it is very frustrating when you want to order a ride and the Safeboda app is not working. I've had the same issue also when my trip has ended, and my rider cannot end the trip to get my fare fee and instead have to negotiate the fare amount with him.",
      "It's not accurate with it search engine. Eg it can match you with a rider 1km away when other riders are nearer and idle looking for customers. It's always on and offline never stable. When I buy credit it takes quite long to update my account. This app is a monopoly in Uganda otherwise with competition it would be out.",
      "Very amazing app and very helpful. It has helped me out in times of need. The only problem is when you get a boda guy who doesn't know where you're going... And you cant explain to him either. And he doesn't know exactly how to read the map.... 😪"

      "This app is awsome, I am still learning how to use it but so far its amazing. I just purchased the premium which I am super happy about. This app is so nice because it let is you take control of your child is phone at any given time. So for example if she has not finished up her chores I can block her phone so she cant do anything with the phone till she is done. It is so worth it.",
      "Excellent! Overall, this is one of the best apps I have found for the purposes of managing my child is activity on his mobile devices. The time blocking function is good.The most recent update made these easier to enter, which was nice. I love that I am able to protect and keep track of my daughter. She cant delete the app.",
      "Excellent work. Very helpful in keeping track of where my child is when I cannot be there. Also if I felt as though my child was dishonest I could also go back and read her texts to the person. Lastly it makes bedtimes less of a struggle because I can just shut my childs device off at a certain time and have it activated in the morning! GREAT PARENTING TOOL!",
      "This app is a joke. I paid for the upgraded version(which was almost a $100 a year). After numerous attempts to contact customer service about an issue, I still get no responce. I can't see all of the texts that are coming in on my kid's phone. I have troubleshooted the problem, but I can't fix it because my daughter's phone does not have the option they're providing. And apps are working even though it clearly states they are \"always blocked.\" Find another app to use!",
      "I tested 10 parental control apps, and this one is clearly the best one, both from the point of view of UI and features. It also allows you to set Review of newly downloaded apps before opening, which is one of the most important steps to make your kids safe from trash, and which is a feature I didn not find in any of the competitor apps."

      "Good app for keeping browser locked and away from kids getting into it. The problem is the auto download feature, which is more of a curse than a blessing because it pops up constantly. There's no point in downloading anyway because this app will not save directly to sd card. If they made a way to disable auto download I would give this app 5 stars.",
      "A great app. Although it has a slide show mode for images it would be nice to get continuous play for video files in a folder. Maybe in a future update? Also \"automatic\" downloads are annoying because the placement of the download dialog. Maybe put it at the top or bottom of the screen so you can see something before you decide to download it, or maybe the option to initiate download with a button? Just my suggestions.",
      "I was using this app and one day my phone was got repaired and when i got it corre ted the appa was not there and when i switched on the app was not there and when i reinstalled all the photos that i stored was not recovered. It should be like google drive coz where ever we open thw files remain safe.",

      "I WAS perfectly content with this app. But my phone decided to reset itself. Now I downloaded it again and have lost all my stuff. I have reached out twice to these people with no response. Be careful using this app because if something screwy goes on you will lose all your stuff. uninstall 😑"

Anyways overall it's a ok security and antivirus app, but I'd be more likely to start using this app again. If the free version also came with internet and Wi-Fi protection.",
      "Paid for premium $2.99/mo. for a year. It never worked. I didn't get premium service. When I got a new phone, I tried to add it..ATT had a service contract with Lookout. Followed instructions on adding the phone... nope... But I did get billed another 29.99 for the yearly subscription. Cancelled it completely. And at earliest convenience, ATT allows the service to be removed. That will be getting done. If customer service isn't a priority, then neither is my money. Somebody else will take it.",

We have tested it thoroughly and found it to be effective and well worth the small premium free per month. The world of security is changing as the threats are changing and Lookout manages those expectations well. This is a well trusted solution for our end clients.",
      "*Update* Worse than before, lookout responded to my review with deception. I have verified, and my observations are accurate. False advertising! 1)No free trial for premium. App def does demand for CC info and immediate payment if u try premium features. If you submit CC info u wil be charged! 2)There is no uninstall prevention and no device admin option from within the app settings as is declared in the gplay description and on the lookout site. 3)Locating device in real time DOES NOT WORK!"

If the issue was fixed I would rate it higher.",

All of the distracting links that used to pull me away from the main thread, gone! 😀 I'm keeping this app, even if it doesn't stop all the nudity! Awesome app, and it's free! They do ask for donations, however. I'll give them some money when I can; it's worth it. 😺",
      "Hello maker , thank you for this app. But Ive found 2 weaknesses of this app. 1. If Someone has to use Xender, then this app's VPN will be off. Then only the sharing anc begin. It's a way to de activate the app without cracking the pin code.. plz fix this. 2.If someone has to use another VPN app then as different servers are selected in the other app, the Safe Surfer Deactivates automatically... Again it has to put it on manually. Crossing the PIN code barrier that I've set up in SafeSurfer.",
      "I love the app, but even if you enable the pin for it the app can still be deleted. It needs to be set if you try to delete the app you need to enter the pin.",
      "Their is Loop holes for this app. The pin protect is good, but can be better by not allowing the user to not unstall the app so easily. There should be a pin protection on the unstallation part too. Please put a pin protection on the part where users can't unstall it."

      "Hasn't recorded a trip since 3/2. I've uninstalled, reinstalled several times. It connects to the beacon, and the next screen is the odometer. I enter it, hit OK, and it goes right back to asking me to enter the odometer. I've restarted the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled again, and it won't work. Too much time wasted on this thing. I do not recommend.",
      "I thought the app would be great to shave money off my insurance as I only drive to and from work. I just don't see how this will work when not all my trips get recorded, or it only records a mile of a 18-mile trip. This app is very faulty and, now I'm not able to use the app at all. The beacon refuses to pair accurately with the app. I am on the 3rd beacon in as many weeks. This is ridiculous. I really despise Drive Safe and Save. This app has been extremely annoying and severely unreliable.",
      "The way that this app registers phone usage is fundamentally flawed, and the devs will just copy and paste a generic response to every review that is pointing out this issue. The detection of being \"movement and screen on\" captures false positives for a plethora of different situations. It's silly to implement a half-baked feature like this. I get dinged for every trip when using my phone once I've PARKED AT MY DESTINATION. It's silly that your algorithm doesn't remove these.",
      "This app is like a virus it sucks the life out of your phone. Is constantly trying to connect to your phone. Brings your rating down when you answer the phone on bluetooth. Shows erratic driving while in construction zones. Said I was speeding I am about ready to say the hell with my discount and send it back. I turn the bluetooth off and the app keeps telling me it cant record my trip when I am sitting at home. The damn thing beeps all damn night. I uninstalled and reinstalled several times.",
      "This app was good, and I got almost a 30% discount for the current 6 months of my policy, but it feels like lately the sensitivity has been turned way up. I was always been 96% and 99% for the first 6 months I had the app, and now I am sitting at 91%, and it feels like I'm getting points taken off on like half my trips. I used to be able to go a week or more and 20+ trips without losing any points."

Several times I tried to move the photos 2 the original directory that was supposed to be UNLOCKED but the images cannot be found!And when I uninstalled the app it deleted the photos permanently, not even disk drill could find the missing photos using deep scan!!! Even if you get access to apps such as the phone gallery or a social app they still can't see the photos even though you have to use the unlock code.",

      "Wow so far this is the best photo lock app I have ever seen. every thing of it is perfect but there's only one problem which is if you lost your phone you will lose everything saved inside. So I wish there should bee a linch up to google so that they can be a backup after u lost your phone thanks.",

You can have peace of mind knowing all your private photos are concealed and any app you may need protected is safe.

Had I been able to do screenshots this wouldn't have happened. :UPDATE: Developer replied to my review within 15 mins. It IS possible to do a screenshot if you disable the password. 5 STARS!!",

Edit 2020-02-09: My old phone broke & I restored my notes from the cloud. But my manual sort order (reverse alpha) was lost. So now my newest notes are at the bottom of about 200 notes & the app won't sort in reverse order! I emailed Support, but they said that's the way it is. So I'm reducing my rating until they fix it!

    "title":"Safe Camera - Photo Encryption",
    "description":"SafeCamera is a camera application that uses the military grade encryption (AES 256) to encrypt your photos on the fly to ensure they are secure, are safely stored and hidden against third party invaders, even if you lose your device and it gets in hands of professional hackers. Securely hide your photos, so that no one except you can access them. SafeCamera has it's own camera module that ensures 100% secure storage of the photos.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\nTake photos that will be instantly on the fly encrypted and thus never be visible to any application or person until you open it with SafeCamera providing your master password.\r\nGallery to browse your encrypted photos\r\nCamera with flash and timer for taking self shots\r\nImport existing photos/files to SafeCamera encrypting also filenames and delete original files\r\nShare encrypted photos ether encrypted with same password, other password or decrypted\r\nImport encrypted files from other SafeCamera instance\r\nEncryption with state of the art algorithms and implementation schemes that are proven to be 100% secure by governmental and military organizations.\r\n\r\nWe have thought of everything! Did you know that once any info is written into the memory and then deleted or even overwritten with another file, it is still possible to restore it? SafeCamera never writes your unencrypted photos into your phone’s SD card. The photo is encrypted on the fly right after it is taken and only then is written to your SD card.\r\n\r\nDo you have files that you would like to keep safe? Just import them into Safe Camera’s domain and they will be safe. Although SafeCamera is mainly for handling photos, you can also import and keep safely any other file types.\r\n\r\nWant to share an encrypted photo with someone?

    "descriptionHTML":"SafeCamera is a camera application that uses the military grade encryption (AES 256) to encrypt your photos on the fly to ensure they are secure, are safely stored and hidden against third party invaders, even if you lose your device and it gets in hands of professional hackers. Securely hide your photos, so that no one except you can access them. SafeCamera has it&#39;s own camera module that ensures 100% secure storage of the photos.<br><br>Key features:<br>Take photos that will be instantly on the fly encrypted and thus never be visible to any application or person until you open it with SafeCamera providing your master password.<br>Gallery to browse your encrypted photos<br>Camera with flash and timer for taking self shots<br>Import existing photos/files to SafeCamera encrypting also filenames and delete original files<br>Share encrypted photos ether encrypted with same password, other password or decrypted<br>Import encrypted files from other SafeCamera instance<br>Encryption with state of the art algorithms and implementation schemes that are proven to be 100% secure by governmental and military organizations.<br><br>We have thought of everything! Did you know that once any info is written into the memory and then deleted or even overwritten with another file, it is still possible to restore it? SafeCamera never writes your unencrypted photos into your phone’s SD card. The photo is encrypted on the fly right after it is taken and only then is written to your SD card.<br><br>Do you have files that you would like to keep safe? Just import them into Safe Camera’s domain and they will be safe.

      "My reply after Dev reply: Android 10 introduced secure camera framework to transfer camera captured data directly without writing to storage. I've looked at the new app. But I'm not a fan of privacy apps with network permissions. Complete offline solution is one of the MAIN reason I've chosen this app. @Alex: Now that Android 10 supports Secure camera framework, can you implement it to support Pixel camera? I'll be the first buyer 😁 also last updated in 2016. does that mean, there no bugs?",
      "Deceptive. I wanted an encryption app to safeguard medical records on my phone. It claims no ads. When you get past the permissions screen and set up a password, you're suddenly told it's a trial version and will contain ads.",
      "Brilliant. Forgot I had purchased the \"pro\" version of this until I looked under the purchases section of the appstore. Glad I did, as its brilliant and also found out there is a desktop version too - top work!",
      "Actual encryption rather than just a hidden folder. 4 Stars as it offers a feature which doesn't always delete originals when transferring yet takes ages to supposedly wipe files from the phone. (A simple delete can still be done manually.) Would love a better slide show option. e.g. auto slide show of images with an option for how many seconds between sliding.",
      "I used to love this app. Like really love it. But since a few Android updates back I only get \"Import failed! Either incorrect password has been entered or the file is corrupt\" error when trying to open a shared file and \"Unable to share\" error when I want to share a file."

And when I searched out the apl in Google Play to see if it needa updating (as it alwats has been the case when it's not working), it is now nowhere to be found. What's going on? And btw, if this gets fixed, could also please fix its other problem which is that it stops working whenever a new update is available? Thanks.",

Yes it is a good blocker but theres a way around that and then when you exit the screen, all the history and data is deleted. Pointless. We need a safe browser without any loopholes. Had this app for a while feeling secure until i realized there was a way around the block. How is there not one single browser out there that is completely free of any and all porn and smut? ....

      "I need SplashID to not sync as soon as I authenticate into it. I need it to sync in the background. Logging in on a bad internet connection makes the sync a terrible experience. Change this behavior. Furthermore, I'm fed up with seeing the \"Please purchase the subscription\" prompt, being I've already purchased a subscription. It fails often and I'm totally fed-up with not getting to my passwords in a timely manner. I have to wait for your stupid prompts to disappear before I can interact with what I've paid for. I contacted support about my problems and they say that it's Google's problem. Nikolai from support said, \"Since the Google Play Store apparently failed to subscribe you, please note I have fixed your license on our side for 30 days, so your apps work for now.\" This is the second time they've done this, so they didn't fix it the first time. My subscription renewed last December so why am I seeing this problem almost 3 months later? Why do I have to keep submitting proof of payment? Why can't they find my subscription and just FIX IT? This software is buggy, but it typically works.",
      "This app is a great tool. But I can't use the number keys at the all. My spashid has a number in it and for the life of me I don't know how to get a number to output. And for whatever reason it lost some of my records.. It might be a problem synch'ing with the Windows 10.x,which runs on the tablet. I uninstalled it then installed it to see if it was during an upgrade.",
      "Most pathetic piece of software. Purchased this piece of junk and the windows app keeps crashing, the android app doesn't sync properly and records keep getting incorrectly overwritten!",
      "Great app for securely storing all sorts of personal information. Would get 5* if it used my device fingerprint sensor instead of just a password.",

Today I logged in looking for some old military photos and it has a different name and EVERY photo I had was gone. Do not download this app. You will regret it in the long run. 0/10 EDIT: 10/2019 The app had an update and now I can view approximately 1/4th of my photos, but the others show a combination lock photo. I assume they are unreadable or compromised. Highly dissatisfied but glad to have some pic",
      "It works pretty well (or at least the older version did...). I was able to recover the files I lost when the app updated by uninstalling it and installing an older version of the app (downloaded v2.0.4 from APKpure). When I opened the app (older version) there was a 'Lost and Found' folder. All I had to do was unhide it. Rating 3/5 because that was a serious mistake by the developers...",
      "have been using this app for years on multiple devices. i just lost hundreds of photos and videos thanks to the app updating itself without me requesting it. this is a tragedy that I had to go through for no apparent reason since there is nothing wrong with the old version. I'd highly recommend anyone that is using this app to backup their files and switch to a different app. the developer should be held accountable for all the users of this app to loose irreplaceable memories without a warning",
      "The application used to be one of the best but after the recent upgrade to Android 8.1 it became the worst. All my hidden photos and videos disappeared. I sent 3 emails enquiring on how to retrieve them but they didn't even respond. to those who lost their photos and videos due to the recent update i have found a solution. there is a site called Aptoide which has the old version of photosafe 2.0.4 .. download the old version and you will be able to retrieve lost photos and videos",
      "DO NOT UPDATE! Used this app for years, brilliant and simple bit of kit, until.... The update, all existing files lost. Nobody answering emails or questions, managed to do a Google search and download an older version (2.0.4) from an 'unsecured source' and got my lost files back. But disgusted that the developers have left so many people in the lurch and not responded to any questions for weeks now, terrible service. Will be uninstalling once I get my files transferred."

      "Great security at reasonable prices. Plus it has a neat little widget to keep all those necessary tools to keep you safe and informed close at hand! I've heard that it causes a lot of phones to run hot, or use a lot of memory.. I've not had that problem personally. However I've got a newer phone with a lot of RAM and a large drive. Soo, no overheating here. It runs smooth, keeps me safe, and freed up a TON of garbage. Afterwards my phone just seemed like it was fresh from the box again. Happy!",
      "Like the ease of use and having battery boost, memory clean etc in one app! But where is the Safe Connect VPN? I have VPN on my desktop, but can't locate on my phone....I purchased the McAfee Pro plan and have auto renew subscription. I purchased this plan because of the VPN. 3/19/20. Downloaded Safe Connect--Thank You! It does not play nice with my credit union app, Facebook or some of my store apps. I purchased McAfee with Safe Connect specifically for these apps. Still giving 4 stars.",
      "It was a little confusing at first learning the technique of getting coverage on all of my devices [ 3 ] and learning how it interacts with my devices .... but it is a great benefit to be able to have more than 1 device per subscription. Had some tech difference with online support that really got temper going ... never been so angry without someone whose native language is not English ... I could not understand him clearly and his tech knowledge was not the standard type but poor.",
      "I had downloaded mcAfee with my subscription in January.20 it disappeared completely yesterday from my phone still OK on computer. I reviewed my a/c it showed \"2\" phones and computer, I called service, notified long wait \"jason \" replied and said he must check my computer showed me warnings CLSID, then said I needed a better version \"$199-500 saw a company in California. Hung up immediately knew I was scammed. Cannot reach you today none of my numbers work and I am afraid now",
      "I actually Pay Money for McAfee & True Key to be on my Laptop & my Mobile. That's what makes it worse that in a Year, McAfee hasn't Fixed \"Stay Signed In For 7 Days\" in mobile settings. Actually, I've given up! Many problems with McAfee's Mobile app! NEVER AGAIN! BV 03/11/29: Thanks McAfee LLC Everybody I hope to update this review with 5 Stars shortly, it may have been a misunderstanding? BV On 03/11/20 McAfee wrote me & told me they're creating a ticket to look in to Year Old Problem. Nothing!"

      "I'm not happy with the app like as before. Previously, if I needed to minimize the app for a short time I could bring it back up without having to log back in. Now I have to use my pin or password each time I minimize the app. Why has this been changed? Has anyone else had this same experience? Maybe there could be a spot in settings where you still use the new update or, you can go back to the way it was. Anyone for this?",
      "Destroyed my phones framerate. Basically it works fine using it only as the login link for your pc but once I turned on the accessibility, and auto fill features my phones framerate plummeted. I didnt know what it was at first. Then I turned Norton back off and boom. I'm back to super smooth. My phone is a Samsung Note 10+ 5G 16gb ram. With no apps open, scrolling only homescreen and menu, so it isn't a hardware issue.",
      "I sent the information Norton requested and still constantly having to log in hasn't been fixed! My wife has the same problem though she doesn't use this app as much. I get kicked out ( after using my pin ) and have to log in with full credentials just minutes after opening the app. For some reason the app seems to delete my pin access after I turn my device back on. I turn my device off every night. Uninstall and reinstall didn't help.",
      "I like the app. The only thing I find annoying is that it is not possible to create your own folders for a specific set of passwords i.e. games, broadband, car, etc. This would make it easier to locate & store usernames & passwords. Other than that this app and it's functionality is great.",
      "Good for synchronization of passwords across devices, but the fonts used make it very confusing when you need to read a password to type it out elsewhere. Uppercase \"I\" and lower case \"l\" is particularly frustrsting, but O and 0 is also a hassle with more complex passwords."

      "I rated it low to get your attention for a question. Does moving pictures to the calculator gallery reduce their quality? I moved a bunch of higher quality images to it, and they seem to not be as high of a resolution anymore or something, even when i remove them from the app. Does your app reduce a photo's quality; if so,why and is there a way to prevent it. Also I encrypted pictures that are on my SD card but can still see them if i go to files on my phone, why? Not very pleased at the moment.",
      "I had over 500 pictures & 30 videos saved n this app. I used. Pattern password as well as a PIN & biotech fingerprint password 4 this app. I also had the app protected frm B N deleted w/o authorization 1st. Long story short, the app had a tab tht popped up tht wudnt go away UNLESS u reinstalled the app. Nw whn i hit the reinstall option, it deleted the app ( which is wasnt suppose2 tht easily) whn i reinstalled, i had 2 set up like i had a new account which caused me 2lose EVERYTHING.",
      "This app is really great and works well, but I wish it had a function to rearrange photos and videos in a custom order, instead of only being able to order them alphabetically or by date added.",
      "No ads, Really great but has one downside: It doesn't auto close, so if you have nudes or anything and forget to close the app, it still shows for a second when you got to close it.",
      "Dear developer, you're awesome and your app is the best (trust me i've tried them all) Most of them don't even encrypt the files, the ones that do will have a serious lack of customization options, generic app feeling, or security flaws that make encryption pointless. This one it goes as far as you can go with a hidden gallery, 1-star reviews are just from people that shouldn't be allowed to use a smartphone in the first place.

      "I've been a Password Safe Pro user for years; I love that I've been able set up the cards however I want. Then I tried Lockrz today, and I was completely bewildered by the interface. Nothing is labeled, and nothing is intuitive. I might be willing to struggle through the fog, but the belligerent attitude of the developer in the comments on here is pretty discouraging.",
      "UPDATE I have \"auto sort\" selected for both group and card contents and my list of websites still has the same intermittent issues with not being alphabetized when I log into the app. Very annoying.",
      "I love the app and have used it for years on several different Android phones. I just switched to a Google pixel 4 this weekend and have not been able to open the app yet. It crashes with every attempt, even after deleting and reinstalling. Please help!",
      "Goodbye to Password Safe service after many years use. The app was good and easy to use with Window version. However, it always had some issues of sync with clouds. When problems were occurred, developer responded quickly once I sent a request. Unfortunately, he seemed to have some arrogant attitudes towards his clients all the time, like many customers have pointed out here in comments. Don't feel comfortable to deal with this kind of customer service anymore. There are plenty Apps in the store, just as good or even better than this one. So long, Kuffs.  Wish you the best!",
      "Great App! I used to have notes all over. It's on my phone and desktop. Great support! Had a question on changing phones and it was answered quickly. Nice way to organize the passwords and allows me to store challenge questions as well. I also store the URL and other notes that helps use the app. It even allows me to set an alarm for when the password hasn't been changed in awhile. It is fully secure and encrypts backup file on Google Drive or Dropbox."

      "Had been using it to track my wife on her running route, with the added bonus of the SOS feature. Unlike the other people whining about paying, we didnt mind paying for the service... But in one of the last updates the app has become absolutely unusable. When it asks for voice permissions and you accept, the app continuously crashes. If you revoke the permission, it launches, but then tracking is all out of whack, sometime showing her in completely wrong neighborhoods, causing quite the scare.",
      "has been charging me for weeks even though I canceled my premium subscription, The FAQ link doesn't work so I do not know how to contact them or get this matter resolved",
      "Unhappy with the product. It worked well for 1.week but now is useless. Support page doesn't work either. If activated righy now, it shows the device location from days ago. Regrettably paid for a 12month subscription.",
      "It was great. I occasionally used it when traveling but now the marketing guys took over and they want $69 a year. Not worth it so I'll delete it. Wouldn't mind ads, but I'm not paying for an app that i occasionally use",
      "The app is not accepting my mobile number. It says enter a valid number. Although it has sent the code for validation!!!"

If this issue is correctly addressed then this app will be PERFECT.",

Ihave used this apps for few years. recently I change phone and this apps just keep closing on me and not allowing me to access my details. email and submitted log but no response. very unfortunate",
      "I've been using this app for years and am pleased with it, though it can be a bit slow to decrypt and erase. Unfortunately, as noted by others, it doesn't work with Android 9 Pie, and the developer doesn't reply to fault reports. It seems that this app is therefore effectively obsolete. A real shame...",
      "Note 9 user. Camera not working internally. Takes me back to pattern login. UPDATE *** Moved to Galaxy Note 10 Plus and the internal camera still doesn't work. This makes for such a hassle to add photos into safe. If the developer doesn't want to support this app he should update the outlook for Users who have been patiently waiting. At this point I think I will have to take the time to move all my data elsewhere. This is going to be an all day event. I would gladly PURCHASE an upgrade if it was available!",

I have no idea if WOT is aware of the issue but I won't increase my review until the problem is resolved. As it is now it suppresses democratic expression. Wikipedia does a good job with political content. I'd suggest looking at their approach.",
      "Seriously? In 2020 I can't block a malicious website. I can put it in the blacklist and the app puts a picture over it, but the website still loads. What good is that? Why can't we BLOCK WEBSITES? As in STOP particular urls from loading? This isn't safe browsing. My phone is still exposed to the malicious websites. Same thing for inappropriate adult websites. The little picture that pops up doesn't cover it. WHAT GOOD IS THAT?!",

      "This browser does exactly what it's supposed to, and is lightning fast. Since it is based on an already well established browser the interface is amazing and I honestly prefer it to chrome.",
      "This app works great, and it even blocks important but pesky apps that can be triggering. The support group is very helpful and goes the extra mile to make sure you are helped. It is also great to still have internet, but without pictures or videos.",
      "I've only had this app for a few days and I'm loving it! Does a great job of blocking all images/videos and locking down other apps as well. If you're looking for a blocker/filter, this is the one to get!",
      "This is a great app! Well worth it. Set up was easy and the benefits are huge. Blocks other web browsers and blocks incognito mode. I'm so glad I found this app. Love the features.",
      "I love this app but i'm from south africa and we use the currency of rands instead of dollars plus the banks we use is different from yours can u please make it simple for people who are from different countries to use and pay for your services without too much hassles best regards."
