      "Best free CRM app out there. The integration of all information into one place is a time saver for small businesses whose owners generally have to be secretary, salesperson, accountant in their off time while doing the work during the day. I recommend this app to anyone who needs to streamline their process.",
      "LOVE THE APp..Its very efficient with keeping up with customers and scheduling task... The only thing keeping it from being a 5star is not being able to view tasks itemized per day.. .. When you click task, all your task show up running together until there marked completed, without the option seeing task only for a certain day..... seems like a small fix ... if they did that, I would make it 5star.... still great app though and worth the purchase",
      "I have used many CRM tools for Marketing, sales, and advertising jobs. I can truly say that LEADer CRM is by far the most advanced, integrated, and versatile tool in my arsenal. The interface is simple enough for beginners to use, yet advanced enough for veteran CRM users. Thanks to LEADer, I have increased my productivity and efficiency more than Corporately purchased CRM apps. Customer support is on point, there is no reason to use anything else. I am even able to use it for my personal life!",
      "This app is awesome except you guys take way too long to make changes that you say that you're making like simply being able to add a picture, adding away to count up leads or tasks completed daily, weekly or monthly, or simply being able to go to someone's Facebook page or messenger right from the app. It's been at least 6 months since you said that you were going to add these features so it's frustrating that it takes so long!!! #STILL #WAITING",
      "Best CRM App to grow business now a days. This will help you to kill competition by giving quick answer to customers. I have used since long time no error no hassle. Good support team for all our needs. I like Lead Call plugin so much. App remind me that which call is important due to app call plugin functionality."

This app deserves it though and here's why; there are some specific features that if they worked would make this app awesome 1. You can send videos via email ( you actually can not, it will crash the app and loose the contents of the email. 2. You can scan and save drivers licenses ( no it crashes and you loose all customer info so make sure you write it down before you hit save! 3. There's more but they cut me short at 500 char",
      "Could definitely use improvement. Website works better on mobile just need drivers license scanner. And that is crashing now with Android 10. Crashes as soon as you hit save and I keep losing information that we get from customers. Please fix 🙏🏽",
      "Its pretty bad with android and not much better with apple. But I use android only now. It won't make calls through the app and everything you click on takes secends to react. Afyer a sale you cannot recall stock nimber or vin number through the app. You have to get on a cpi to find that info. Theres so many things missing on this app. I could go on and on. Its bearable but really because we don't have a choice.",

      "Update: app sucks. When not let me in and keeps giving me an error code. So tired of this inconsistency and being locked out. SNAP!! it locks you out of your messages and then asks you to register as if you don't have an account. I've only been using this for about six months and it's already happened three times. Can't reply to people's messages. Missed sales. very frustrating. Not sure why they aren't fixing this problem because according to other people it's been going on a long time",
      "No support on bugs at all. I do not get audio notifications for items I'm selling. example: a person messages me wanting to buy an item, I see it FOUR HOURS later. response .metrics/times are way up to an hour because of this bug. could have lost the sale and look like a clown for not responding when OFFERUP NEVER NOTIFIED ME. What's up guys? This sucks. Update: There literally is NO support. Just random comments trying to look like they are actively doing something. they definitely aren't",
      "The app works well for the most part and does have some consistently great deals. After their last update I had to reinstall the app in order to do a new post, which has me a bit concerned on their regression testing process. Just an annoyance, I would still recommend folks trying it out.",
      "Seems like it could have been a good marketplace with good deals but you can't actually buy anything. Sellers just never respond to even full price offers or worse accept then cancel the sale. Days or even weeks wasted. Unreliable or inactive sellers/listings need to be removed. Too frustrating as is, uninstalled.",
      "OfferUp used to be so good. Now it's riddled with bugs, scams, and overall just a terrible experience. For the past year I've been unable to post from mobile data and now I can't log in. No way to contact support, not that they do anything anyway. Time to ditch OfferUp and find a better app to sell on."

      "This app is great for browsing estate sales near you or far. It makes it easier for me to plan my trips as opposed to signing up to email lists. I will recommend that the app makes it new adjustments, such as allowing us to block certain sellers and rate them, simply because we as consumers need to alert the community of bad behavior from these sellers. If the app can do that. I'll give it a 5 star.",

      "This app is AWESOME!!! It's super easy to use and I found 5 different Estate sales on last sat that I would've never of found unless for this app. Its awesome for not wasting your time because most of the Yard sales and Estate sale listings have pics of there highlighted items for sale and if pics aren't available the sales have typed list of what they're selling. I love it.",
      "Besides the odd glitch that causes my phone to vibrate randomly for 60 seconds when I first open the app, it's now become very difficult to mark and manage my sales. Markers will share the same number or even erase themselves while I'm out traveling to them. I was using this pretty often but it's becoming too difficult to use these days (Moto Z)",
      "I use this app every weekend! I love the new option of navigating to either the pin location or the address, and the extra pin colors. It still needs a \"never again\" feature, for the repeater sales that are crappy.",
      "Love this app. We can see quickly where sales are, what's being sold and what the hours are.🥰",
      "Thief after 3 years is making me pay for the app every year. I paid when it was a one time fee. Now I feel ripped off to have to pay again. If I new you could change to yearly I never would have gotten. Now app is junk. Greedy!"

However still a better browsing experience than play store. Yes I found the filter on main tab which is pretty handy but it is far from ideal. Still a great app though.",
      "I would like to have the option to receive notifications only about true free apps and games, and filter them for the most stared ones as well as the option to sort the apps by stars and by original price in order to filter the junk, unuseful apps. Noticed that not all of the apps on Google's Play store are searchable. Also, an AMOLED theme can never harm an app. I will update the review as soon as these crutial features get their way to the app and when you reply to me so I notice.",

      "The app seems ok but it's a fundamentally dishonest company behind it. They refuse to disclose pricing on their website or even when requested. They contact you within an hour or two of installing it trying to bully. They are relying on hooking you in during the trial period then trying to gouge you, so don't fall for it.",
      "Amazing app! Solved all of my needs in the field, including efficiency in routing for drive time and even prospecting for new clients. Haven't experienced any bugs and when I did need help with some features on the app, I was able to call their customer support line and get someone on the phone immediately to assist!",
      "I truly love this app. I had a rough go in the beginning and immediately got a phone call trying to understand the issue. Their customer support is phenomenal. I truly feel like my needs are important to them. I cannot even begin to describe how awesome Michael is to deal with! He is a gem!!!",

This app is useless and only further perpetuates how disconnected top down management is from the day to day of front line operations and sales teams. Back to the lap top.",
      "Salesforce mobile app has no help support and cannot reset my password. If you use reset password option, it sends you an email link. Use the link and it takes you right back to same login screen with no option to create new password. Highly inconvenience. Guess I'll stick to laptop Salesforce.",

It doesn't use the normal Android calendar view to pick a date it just shows you the year, month, day num, and then let's you scroll through it. I never know what the date is for when I want something to be due, but I do know two Fridays from now etc."

When you enter the domain and click on the Login button, the app does absolutely nothing. No error message. It doesn't even appear to be checking the domain. It just sits there with the same message asking to type in the domain. Killing the app and starting from scratch yield the same results. Come on, guys! Think about the EUX! Show error messages!",

      "This app is terrible!!! The info appears differently for the info on the website, even after syncing, which takes an extremely long time, btw. Pictures uploaded in the app appear sideways or upside down on the website, in order to view the pictures uploaded through the app, without twisting your neck you, they have to be downloaded, which completely defeats the purpose of uploading the picture! I tried reaching out to customer support on the website but they were no help. FIX THE APP!!!!!!!!!!",
      "Can't login to the Android app using Google authentication. Keeps telling me that my organization requires SSO, and disallows username / password, which I already know. Reached out to support via the desktop web app, and they gave me a run-around for 30 minutes, and finally said they'd reach out to engineers. The web app is great, but I can't even use the Android app."

      "The old version is way better than the new version because the old app was simple and easy to follow and you can see everything on the page together. The new version has too much information that you don't need scattered in-between too many pop-ups and if you don't know to keep strolling down you will miss the other items the seller is selling and they loose out. Go back to the last version. This version doesn't make sense.",
      "Great app. The distance setting in the search filter was a little off. Like I tried putting in items up to 30 miles away but it had some stuff in there that was to me like 40-50 miles away. It seemed better when I narrowed it closer to my location though. That's the only issue I've experienced with it. The process to post what you want to sell is NOT overly complicated, it's simple to use, but it's kind odd looking for me though. But that's just my opinion there, everything else seems great.",
      "I've had great success with this app, my only complaint is regarding the ads. I do understand to keep this app 100% you need to show ads but I find them to be repetative, rather intrusive and very large. If you don't know to keep scrolling once you see a large ad then you will miss out on a lot things for sale.",
      "It's a great way to make extra money. It's fun to meet with all the interesting people however there are a few flaws to the game. For instance, it is a turn off when a person promises to purchase and they give a date and time then they never show up! Its It's frustrating, and a waste of time I wish that LETGO could implement some kind of consequence for the people that stand people doing things",
      "This is a platform that works and is built well. However the app still has many bugs. They're mostly annoying, some are a little inconvenient. None of them inhibit use of the platform though. They've got a ways to go, and are founded on solid ground. Personalized recommended searches must be based on nothing, because I get recommendations for electronics but all I search for a bit are clothes. Notifications to my phone duplicate themselves, lag, and are sometimes broken."

Every night Penny curates an achievable list of your important, time sensitive tasks and puts them on your Daily screen. When you're having your morning coffee (or manage to find 5 minutes in your busy daily routine) simply open Penny and power through the tasks you need to accomplish today to not only keep your business on track but help it grow. You'll never be overwhelmed again.\r\n\r\nBe more organized and less busy\r\n\r\nPenny will let you know the right time and information to connect with your customers, ensuring you're engaged with your customers and they're ordering regularly. Best of all, she'll do this automatically, while you sleep, so your orders and reminders will be there each and every day, allowing you to focus on customer relationships instead of organizing your time.\r\n\r\nWe call this the Customer Care Cycle, it's designed to include steps in the order process as well as touch points along the way. These steps include:\r\n\r\n“Check-in” -  scheduled a few days after your customer places their order\r\n“Connect” - added a few weeks after they received their products\r\n“Autoship Reminder” - appears 20 days before your customer is due to re-order\r\n“Reconnect” - reminds you to connect with customers who haven’t ordered in 4+ months \r\n\r\nKnow when to reachout and follow up\r\n\r\nPaper is meant for planes, not a prospect list.

      "there's no doubt that these folks want to help but I've had so many problems I wish I had never gotten involved with it. The biggest problems are around the user interface updating and viewing contacts in Android",
      "BUG: I cannot add users to any of the zones that I create. when I click on a name to add it does not respond and nothing is changed. Thank you for the update! Finally this app is usable on an android smartphone. Still room for performance improvement, but the ludicrous issues crippling the app seem to have been resolved. Recently realized there is a 'current location' button hidden in the map icon menu, thats an important function I didnt see before.",
      "Super buggy. Slow for what we do. I work in Solar and we need to see all our coworkers pins. They take forever to load on Samsung. Seems like it's friendlier to Apple Users. Was asked to do a 5 star review for a free shirt. Kinda hinky. I think it's better to earn reviews for having a great app. Hope they improve this and stop telling me I need to keep upgrading my phone to have it function smoother. When the newest Samsung devices have the same issues.",

      "App has potential but lack of customer support is impossible to work with. I have 7 mobile sales reps. Currently using invoiceASAP. I wanted to switch to InSitu Sales app because of several features that invoiceASAP doesn't offer. The good.. 1. Credit invoices will sync into Quickbooks 2. Sales reports on mobile device are great for commission paid sales reps. 3. Routing feature is good for keeping reps organized 4. Price levels for different customers The bad.. 1. Survey's do not work 2. Credit features is not user friendly 3. Payment applied in QuickBooks will not sync back to the app 4. You can not remove estimates or orders from dashboard. I think InSitu has a good product but poor execution. I purchased 2 keys for me and a rep to test before switching the other reps over. I was told I would receive a tech support call to set up my company and walk me through the different features. They cancelled on me the morning of. I emailed several times requesting another date and time. They never responded to my request. I attempted to set up the app myself over the course of a month. Then the syncing issues started. InSitu claims the iPhone 6 was the problem. Same iPhone that runs every other app with no issues. This was the end of road for me. If they could every get their $#!+ together it'd be a 5 star app.",

      "Taking advantage of Coronavirus to make money by featuring upcharged health products. The virus toll counter is also updated slowly, as there have been way more confirmed cases than it says. I used to like this app, but I never thought it would get this scummy.",
      "Ive always enjoyed this app but i dont think they push the sale of local items that much i think they are more concered with the auctions and the Dash section. Ive bought 2 items with both arriving broken and yes they refunded my money but wouldnt send another one to replace it nor any compensation for the trouble it caused me both times. It makes me think i shouldnt buy from dash anymore you cant contact the seller individually. I do like the point system though so 5 stars it is for now",
      "App has changed so much, it's just not the same. Pitiful views, no boost option except with coin rewards which are just a waste of time to complete, and why is this app using over 1G of my storage space? That's un heard of. The Dash feature needs to be monitored unless this is no longer a family friendly app, I mean items range from crotchless lingerie to bondage looking items and barely nude models showcasing these? Seriously guys, not family friendly at all",
      "find anything you need on this app at awesome prices!!! EDITED: I live in the United States but for some reason when I try to share the link to friends or share the app for them to download, it says \"sorry this is not available in your country\" ??? So exactly what countries actually get the rewards for sharing the app with their friends? I will change my review back to 5 stars when I get a good reason for this. Other than is issue, I have loved the app so please let me know why.",
      "Better than other apps, but still needs work. I miss the shipping feature since it helped me get some cool stuff not usually found local. That should still be up to the seller though. The coins feel gimmicky, and kinda more annoying than fun. Still need to not be able to rate literally anyone you have a conversation with ( black mirror anyone?) And as for \"removing inappropriate ratings\", still have it on there after 4 yrs, but removed their's."

      "Before you download this app be aware that the extent to which they will pass along, and the liberties they will take with your private info borders on incredible. READ THE T&A, PRIVACY POLICY. If that's not enough, the app size listed in the \"about\" readme is about 18mb. The actual size of the install is almost 100mb. Just so you know. I'm certain there are plenty of alternatives out there and - I'm outta here!",
      "I use this app for sharing/seeking recommendations and commenting on local issues. Also for advertising community events. The ambience of discussion is friendly and helpful. Occasional techy exchange of views, but the only aggressive 'troll' I have read seemed to get cut out fairly quickly. There is some monitoring , both automated (warning if you use a sweary word) and I think real time person monitoring. So it is a useful social media platform. Advertising keeps it going - not too intrusive.",
      "A great idea and easy to use but it's only as good as the people who use it. I hope that it will not become another medium for people to promote their business and selling stuff. There are apps for that and Facebook has plenty. I appeal to people to avoid this and use it for the things that connect us rather than as a monetizing tool!",
      "I find it helpful for getting people to do work around my house using other folks recommendations and I give mine too. The notifications about crime are also great and folks are aware of what's going on in their neighborhood. I appreciate the sheriff's dept alerts, too. Great all around app.",
      "I haven't had this app long, but it does provide helpful local information. It is rather confusing but that should get better with use. Especially now, people are posting good information related to coronavirus resources, help for those needing assistance, and even a central Mid-Hudson Valley group who's mission it is to connect people needing help with those who can offer it."

Absolutely causing issues for sales and buys. I was obsessed and impressed with the app for a very long while. I'm almost over it now with all the issues!",
      "I love this app for many reasons! 1) I can sell my unwanted items without leaving the house. 2) I can buy an item without having to wait in line at a store; too many times it took so long that I just put the item back and left. 3) Porch pick up (PPU) is great, especially if you have kids! 4) Last but not least, you get to meet great people and be part of a good community!",
      "I love this app, find it useful for finding great local deals! It would be better if the messages showed up right away instead of only when the page is physically refreshed or restarted, and if the search engine would have filters, search within price range etc. Still would reccomend to friends though.",
      "Nice to have a place to buy good used items. But it's very frustrating if you forget your password login. I did and clicked to send email to reset several times and didn't get email to reset. I finally figured out my password on my own. Now I have no notifications updating on the app. Nothing new showing in the last 24 hours?!",
      "I absolutely love love love this App. It's the best way to get rid of your unwanted clutter. It's all local and would recommend this app to everyone. Also if you are looking to purchase things, they have just about anything you can think of. And the people are very friendly."

      "This app is awesome. a little tricky figuring out how to add products at first. but once i figured that out its smooth sailing. watch the help videos before you uninstall this app thinking you cant add products. i almost did that. and almost left a bad review. but luckily i saw the link for the help videos. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",
      "A very useful app with one exception. It needs to be able to track assembly of product. You make a product that requires more than one part to make a new part from your stock of parts, there is no way to put them together as final part in inventory except to subtract from each sub part then add to final part number. This is time consuming. It would be great if the app could do this auto, like a sales order but instead of just taking parts out it could add the finished part to inventory.",
      "I used and liked this app. But now that I no longer use it, I cannot get them to stop charging me. They just keep taking payments and won't respond to me to remedy this.",
      "I see it's simple/minimalistic attributes. However, I still find it complex, for instance when creating an item it doesn't have the option for entering 'cost price' and 'selling price' instead it uses an 'average price' wc is a turn off for me,... Edit: one more star 🌟 for response I Edit 2: pls what is the difference BTW this app and the inventory plus app | Edit 3: pls can an option for returns and exchange be added to the app?",
      "Best one I have used, A++ to them on customer service! They helled me with a lot of modifications to my account. I only have one issue with it and that it takes the time from their servers and not from the local device so I have to to keep reminding myself to adjust the times. I can't wait to see what the next updat will bring."

      "It's great. It's the simplest way of keeping track of items you sell. I am a prepaid load retailer, and this app is so simple. I just put the product, put how much of the product they bought, their name and number is saved, and I can pull up their pending purchases. It's easy to mark when paid. No frills, just a few entries and you can easily track sales. Keep it up! Highly recommended! Hope you accept donations of lesser amount. I'd be happy to donate.",

I need a report that show me the products that I sold to a customer (reciveables & paid), quantity and amount for each product.. same thing for products.. i need to know who bought this product (rec & paid), quantity and amount. Finally, most customers pay their loans later on 2 or 3 payments so I should distribute the amount of the payment on each folio.. I need accounts for customers",

Secondly if we can know our profile on every sale's without opening reports for easy discounts for our customers. Thirdly I have been trying to share with another phone through backup and restore and is not responding well thanks",
      "Great app, I have just started with few days ago, but it seems like there is no options for me to control the total stock in values or currency not in the amount of the products, like I said may be I am here to find the option yet. But so far I confirm it , to have been a great app.",

      "I paid for this app and everytime i open i swear thier are only 15 apps all together that either free or discounted and there is way more app on sale on google play then what this app actually shows you. Appsales has a way better selection and they only charge $1.99 a year. I dont understand like why would they just post a couple random apps that they think should be on thier when everybody have different oppions and like it would worth the money if they grouped and filterd every discounted app.",
