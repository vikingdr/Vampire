The suggested minimum deposit is perfect. No social media and connection to actual bank, so that's good üëçüèº, I like to keep them separate from other apps and not integrated.",
      "This is the best money app I've found. It's super simple and easy to use. The layout isn't overly complicated and you can add widgets to your home screen. There's transaction history. The most important feature I've found is it tells you how much you need to put in daily/weekly/monthly to achieve your goal! 10/10 best savings tracker I've ever used.",
      "Brilliant App...This app has helped me greatly with my savings goals. The only thing that is not included is the currency of my country. I will be very pleased if you could include PAPUA NEW GUINEA currency in your next update...Thank you so much and well done developer...üëç",
      "This deserves more than 5 stars! This is simply the best. Simple UI, Easy to set up, themes, and most importantly no ADS or IAPs.",
      "Loving it so far. If you need an app that is non invasive and literally just shows you how far your savings progress is, this app is for you. I love how this app is soo simple & dosen't require you to log your income. You literally just tell the app how much you need to save , your deadline & how much you've saved so far. I don't need to worry about my data privacy because I don't have to tell the app much in the first place. I hope everything I'm currently getting stays free for life."

      "The balance updates are a day behind. That delay doesnt lend itself to the balance threshold feature. By the time digit realizes that my balance fell, j have already addressed it. For goals, it would be helpful to set a time frame to reach the goal. For example, if I am saving for a trip. I want to be able to tell digit that I want to save X amount in the next 6 months. Then digit can save more aggressively according to the goal and time frame set.",

I love that I don't really have to stress over finding extra money because this app does it for me. I really love how you can establish a savings priority making it possible to save for a rainy day and make an extra payment to your credit card.",
      "I have only joined Digit for about 4 days now. I assumed it saves money from your direct deposits on payday. I get paid weekly and Digit has already pulled from my account twice. Why?? I tried to explore the app for how it actually works, but it's not much help. I do appreciate the convienence of it saving automatically, just not back to back. Is there a schedule I can set or is this how it works? If not I might have to delete this app.",

House deposit, holiday) and keep track of what portion of my savings is going where. I prefer it to other apps of a similar nature because for me it is easier to keep track of, doesn't require my bank details and means I can keep all my savings in one bank account yet still have an idea of how much I have saved for each thing.",
      "Really great app to track your savings. It gives you estimates on when you'll reach your goal based on your saving activity. Great stats which are really detailed even for a non premium account. You also get reminder as push notifications if you spend a lot of time without adding any money to your piggy bank. Last but not least, the ads are not intrusive, unlike any other apps on the market. A tab is made with the option to view an ad if you want. Really LOVE this app and fully recommend.",
      "Love this simple app! It's exactly what I was looking for-just input the numbers & watch the bar grow! I had one before that only allowed 4 different goals & then wanted to charge me to have more than that - ridiculous! As far as I know, you can have as many different goals as you need in this one. Complete with reminders for deadlines & graphs to watch your savings over time! Thank you guys!",
      "VERY easy to use! Helps you set saving goals and celebrates when you reach them. Only problem is you can't record money without a goal (so there's no way to keep track of spending money).",

      "Great app! Quapital helps me save unconsciously by letting me set the terms on when to save and how much when I am paid. Without having it done in a way that I don't notice it, I wouldn't typically save very much or anything at all. The support team is also very helpful and quick to respond and resolve any issue or questions. Highly recommend!",
      "Great way to save, I've used for like 7 months and i love how it help in saving money. Then I decided to take break and later on I downloaded the app again I tried to link my bank account again and it kept telling me error. I was so disappointed.",
      "They say they won't charge after you've reached under $100 in your bank account. But they've continuously did it to me. And refuse to take responsibility for it. Maybe they need to upgrade whatever system they're using to check balance before transferring money because of the rules you have in place.",
      "This app has made saving possible for me! I don't even notice the money coming out and it stops if my funds are low. I greatly recommend this!",
      "NO human customer support, STUCK with NO money! - $5648 I CAN'T GET to becuase I'm getting a \"error contact customer support.\" - Send you to an AI messaging support app that is garbage at understanding what you need. - Can't add a different bank because I'm getting a connection error. -Any app dealing with your money should have 24/7 call support. - Charge you a fee for nothing at all. No free option any longer. Thanks for the extremely stressful 4 days, Qapital!"

      "So far this app is exactly what it said it would do. Pretty straight forward. Something this app doesn't have which could be helpful is to tell you how much money you need to complete your goal. Like $50 left of $100. Sometimes it's nice to have it all laid out in front of you. What you want/what you've earned/what's left",
      "It would be better if you could toggle the sounds and vibrations on the app and if you could choose different clothes for your piggy to differentiate between accounts. Also, it would be good to have a way to edit your history in case you mistype something. But even as it is it's a really cute and fun app",
      "Rating temporary as I have yet to use this app for an extended period of time. So far the app is wonderfully simple, easy to understand, and functioning. The little pig mascot actually has a surprisingly large effect of giving the app life, which helps convince myself to use this app.",
      "I didnt go on for like a few weeks and all my goals dissappeared? Not everyone saves daily or even weekly. I liked the format but I'm not gonna go on every few days to say I saved +$0, because you cant do that. And you cant have a $0 balance, or a negative balance either",
      "Works great, but I have a few questions: how to delete or change an amount saved after I saved. For example, if I saved $20 and wanted to change it to $25, how do I do that? Can I back date my start date and savings dates.. for example if i want to save wkly and wanted to start Sept 1 ans depoait wkly after that. Hoping someone might know how."

      "Quite good. Better than other apps. I like that I can add my own pictures to the goals helps keep me motivated. Would be nice if I could see overall statistics for all my goals like the total amount I need to save up for all my goals combined, weekly and monthly would be nice. But it's a good-ish app. Can be better though.",
      "I was trying to decide between this and a similar app. I get that this is a free, try-before-you-buy version but I was hit with two full video ads within three screens. That's overkill and doesn't really make want to sit through however many more just to feel the app out.",
      "If you implement the possibility to group or order by saving account I'll give you five stars, that's all I'm missing (even as a Pro only feature is fine, I already bought it). Everything else is great. EDIT: I noticed the sort order doesn't get saved and I have to sort every time. Slightly frustrating.",
      "Everythings pretty good except you cannot reorganise your goals except for alphabetically or due date. I would rate this 5 stars if you can reorganise goals by \"drag and move\" and not be limited to the two above options. Thanks"

      "I'm a very visual person when it comes to working towards my goals & this app has proven many times over to be my perfect motivator. I love seeing the percentage bar grow, even in the degree of the percent, because it reminds me the impact that even the smallest investment in a savings goal can make. To date, this app has played a substantial role in helping me save almost $11,000 towards various goals and you can bet that this app is going to be my #1 in helping me continue that streak.",
      "I used this app for savings, I put money away safely and separately. This help me keep track with my mutiple savings. I used this app on a daily basis. I thank you for creating one and very fast responses. I recommend it to anyone trying to keep track of their finances. Will be recommending suggestions very soon.",
      "5 stars! I love this all because it keeps all my money in one place (two places, technically). I can keep my savings all together and know when I'm done with my projects, which are moved to a separate place, away from the works-in-progress. Thank you!",
      "This app allows you to use change (cents) for accuracy, instead of rounding up to next dollar. I also like being able to use +/- so I can keep track of paying off debts.",
      "I think it's a great app ! Love how it shows me my money chart and shows me what ive been saving and how much i have left to go download this app if you're serious on saving money and having a chart off it !"

      "This app really does help save money! I log in each pay week and just add a little something. With preset options or the ability to customize the amount, it's easy to tap a couple buttons and know you've accomplished a goal! Negatives would be that it does kick you out and will occasionally crash. Otherwise I really enjoy it!",
      "Update 3/03/2020: I had to contact customer service several times to find out why my money from my closer account wasn't transferred. Also my paper check from an earlier withdrawal. After the 3rd time (yesterday) I got it today electronically.",
      "Only been using 2 days, but so far it I love it. Everything seams to work smoothly and I really get the feeling that it is a well run company/organization. For example, their membership is completely reasonable at $9.99/year! Also when signing up, there was given the option to auto-renew annually, but it is turned OFF by default. How many other subscription model companies show such obvious and meaningful care for their customers? This is so helpful for me to save money, I'm happy to pay $9.99.",
      "I deleted all my tip jars over a month ago and money is still being taken out of my account. I deleted my bank information on the app in addition to the tip jars, $5 was still taken out and now I can't log back in to withdraw the money üò† If you want money stolen, download the app.",
      "Nice. Takes awhile for the micro transactions to come through. Had problems logging in for a moment, but that cleared up once my internet connection was restored. Happy this is free. Overall pretty good app. So far; trusted. Edit: still a good app, keeping the 3 stars. But I am having 1 problem. 1 of my tip jars started acting up. I had to cancel the pending transfer for $1; I pressed withdraw, jar tipped upside down, & got stuck. Transfer went through, now idk where my money is. Please fix.."

      "This is a great app. You can link all of your credit cards, bank accounts, expenses and know how much you have. It takes some times to update after payments because it goes off of the financial institutions and their processing times. Once the payments are withdrawn. It updates your balances. This is how banks work. It's a great app and easy to use. You can set budgets for your expenses. I set budgets for fuel, fast food, coffee, cash, etc. The app recognizes your expenses and categories them.",
      "I'm changing my rating from 2 to 4 stars. The app has come a long way. The only thing that I'd like to see happen is the app being faster to recognize transactions in my checking account. Otherwise, great app with an awesome budget feature. You can really customize the budget and put transactions in whatever category you want or just go with the suggested category.",
      "Takes about two months to figure out the budgeting and how it aligns with your spending but since I've started using it in October I've been able to consistently save money and pay off credit cards. I have really enjoyed the bar charts to show when you are green, yellow, or red in terms of spending habits. I always used an excel sheet for budgeting but it is so nice to have an app auto update all expenses.",
      "I used Mint for a long time then it stopped syncing to my bank account in spite of numerous attempts to fix it. I'm sad that I will be looking for an alternative app if these problems continue much longer. Who has time to devote to figuring out the help system maze via Facebook or Twitter? Not me. I'm obviously not the only one experiencing this either.",
      "I like using the app so I can check my finances in real time. It works pretty well. Here are some things I'd like to be able to do. - rules carry-over from desktop version to app - ability to assign categories to pending transactions (otherwise, the app miscategorizes and we get a notification of over-spending) - modified: adding a new merchant is possible! Up'd my review to 4 stars."

      "Edited review - At one point I loved this app, then had some issues, but it was rectified. Now, I'm changing my review for the 3rd time. This app is NOT worth the headache and frustration. It's always the same coupon and the same glitches. I'd rather not get any money back then waste my life away trying to earn $1 back here and there.",
      "I initially gave 5 stars, but then I had to change it to 3 solely because it seems like the offered items are items I don't use. There used to be the \"For You\" selection that recommended items based on what you regularly buy or save, but lately my \"For You\" selection has been extremely off and the overall selection seems to have diminished. If I do redeem anything, it's for non-brand specific items. Then, when I do not redeem for a certain time, an amount is deducted from my overall savings.",
      "I like the savings with this app and learning about new products. I do geel it could be more user friendly and that at least you should always have credit for wntering a receipt. Also even if you can connect your card you should also be able to submit a receipt. I missed out on 3 deals from a new store because I did not know I needed to connect the card before I went. I spent all that time looking up deals and then did not get them.",
      "The recent update removed the QR code option, and the barcode scanner almost NEVER WORKS. Entering the 20 digit code manually is an unfriendly hassle of a user experience. I'm just about DONE with Ibotta now. It's used to be a good working, friendly, pleasant app. Now it's a hassle, and worst of all, it only finds me a mere FRACTION of the money it used to. Almost worthless now.",
      "Love it, so much it started my whole entire coupon in adventure. I am not very happy with the recent changes, it used to let you scan a receipt more than once for instance if you didn't get credited for an offer that is on your receipt oh, you could just scan it again remove the items you've already been credited for and received credit for the one that was meant unfortunately now it seems as if you can only skin at 1. So if anybody you know that's in charge read this please fix"

Just an idea . Good job yall",

      "I been using savingstar for years and I use to love it. But now, there are barely any new offers to redeem! Ever since beginning of January 2020, there hasn't been any offers. Good luck cashing out because you need at least $20 to cash out but at this rate, it'll take forever. So disappointing! And the last update for this app was on 12/9/19....what the heck? No new offers and no update for months? Strange!!",
      "Doesn't work... after scanning products, then scanning receipt it freezes at the receipt process. I have tried for 4 days at different times throughout day, home wifi/cell Verizon data plan but never works. If my receipt is longer than one click, it freezes and won't let you take any more photos of receipt. So then if you try to get out of receipt photo mode it completely takes you out and you have to start all over again...scan products again, etc. Very frustrating. Stick with Ibotta.",
      "App was great when there wasn't such a high redemption requirement ($5, I think it was), but now at $20 you'd be hard put to earn enough by the end of the decade, by which time SavingStar may be out of business. Offers are just too sparse (18 as of today, for example) to be of much good.",
      "It is a good app not much problem with it, but once you select you stores while you are setting up your acct. It would not let you add the stores again. Even though it gives you the option to add most stores to get your cash refund, you can't scan the receipt if you store wasn't selected at 1st.",
      "I'm so mad at this app. I'll get a notification that there are new offers, I'll try to save an offer, the app doesn't let me save it, so I close and reopen the app. The new offers are now GONE and nowhere to be found anywhere on my account. This app used to work great but this has been happening for the past 3 weeks, essentially making this app now useless."

      "Good app but wish there where more options for savings! New year decided to start doing 1p saving challenge and also the 52 weeks saving challenge which this app does well. If it had the option to have a 1p saving challenge like day 1 - 1p day 2, 2p, day 365 - ¬£3.65 example I would pay the ¬£1.79 a year fee but since it doesn't I'll cancel that in the next day or so during the free trial. I paid to remove the adds as they where anyoying me. Nice choice of stock photo. More options needed but good",
      "I can customize my currency, set my savings goals, and the frequency of my deposits. The app calculates how much I'll save at the end of the year and how much I'll need to be contributing. It sets up a reminder date to keep reminding me to save. The interface is user-friendly and easy to follow. I love it, 5 Stars üåü",
      "Simple yet an effective app. But can you add an option to have it like a countdown starting from 52 instead? I think sometimes it's better to start with larger amounts while we are full of enthusiasm at the beginning of saving. Thanks!",
      "It works great. Does everything I need. I would like if you uncheck a box on a week you saved it would ask if you really want to uncheck it. I like that I don't have to go in order of weeks I can save $5 one week and the next save $40. My pay fluctuates so if I have more that week I save more. I like that it lets you choose different amounts. It's a great app. Not overly fancy, but does what it needs to do. Has ads, but not a lot. I understand everyone's gotta make some money :)",
      "I paid to get rid of the advertisements, but then you still have to pay a little more to change your background wallpaper, that's pretty $hitty! Only complaint"

      "Updated my rating to 5* because I was able to find all my past records for EACH category under Statistics>Reports. A very useful app. I now know: 1. How much I spent paying debts. 2. How much money I have in Total. 3. My biggest expenses and 4. I don't need to remember when a payment was made because everything is recorded in real time and easily retrievable. I'll buy the paid version. Thanks to the developer.",
      "I was extremely excited that you could connect bank accounts and have them sync on their own when you purchase premium. The reason I'm giving a two star rating is I could only get 4 accounts connected and keep them connected. We bank with Capital One and I was able to get it connected and then it just wouldn't connect. Target, Kohls and a few others just won't connect. Get your syncing fixed and I might come back. Going to request a refund.",
      "Decent enough free version, though there are a few problems. The biggest one for me is that the \"balance forecast\" appears to be counting my planned payments as positives instead of negatives - i.e. my landlord is paying me rent instead of the other way around. As a result the numbers are so wrong that it's almost comical. I have to use an excel sheet for this instead. There are a couple of things I wish were added too, like being able to separate expenses per day by category in reports.",
      "This is clearly the result of a competent team which cared about user experience. One annoying thing is that I \"can't delete record in connected account\". I'm tracking a bank account and two credit cards. It calculates all of the expenses from the credit cards twice - once for each purchase on the credit card statement, and then the monthly billing of the bank account as well. There should be a simple way to exclude a transaction from the statistics.",
      "Looked very good structurally and I could see a great future. But you have to keep connecting to the banks. One of my banks it cant connect now. But competative software can. It also doesn't cover all the banks I use. A competative product does a lot more banks. I have reported all this to wallet but wishful promises are never delivered. And I have bought a lifetime subscription. Shame on me. I cannot see why it is the editors choice still."

      "Awesome deals...if you can get to them before their gone that is. Helped me with my 1st year baby stuff a ton!! Dont know much about couponing but they make it dummy proof with step my step instructions on every deal and links for everything you need. Love seeing what pops up everyday!! If your not like me and dont like to be bothered as much the notifications are super customizable for your preferences and are always asking to make sure they're set how you like. 5 out of 5 well done ladies",
      "I must say, this app has cleaned up very nicely. This app saves you money on products that people actually use. Unlike other apps that show you circulars to multiple stores. This app cut straight to the Chase and shows you where all the best deals are. I have multiple apps that display coupons but this one is by far the best, I've seen deals that were in other apps that this app displays plus more. In fact this app is so good I have deleted the other apps within this category. Great job",
      "Great layout, hundreds of stores to choose from and easy step by step guide to use paper coupons, digital coupons and sale prices all together to save up to 90% off the original price. This is the best couponing/sale site I've found. KCL helped me build a very large stockpile in less than 4 months. üòä",
      "Love the deals posted on this app, the coupon break down & steps are very easy to follow!! Its a must download app to have on your phone especially if you like to save money on your favorite ptoducts and check out the nonadvertisted hidden savings in all your local favorite stores n get in on the hott savings online!! You will be glad that you did!! Also check out the free items!",
      "I Love it! It Keeps you in the Know, Up to Date, has a Variety of everything. Another Fav of mine unlike other Apps, is when deal Expires, it Lets you know so you Dont Waste Your Time. Only Down Fall, is That I DONT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GO AN GET EVERY DEAL!!"

      "IMPORTANT READ!!! Before you go and sign up make sure this is what you want to do. I created an account on 3/18/20 and during the process when you give your debit/credit they say they will not charge you but they do indeed even if you don't link your bank account to your profile so be forewarned this company's app is very deceptive it will charge you for whatever subscription you choose. I explained this to customer service that the charge was not authorized but they did not care or refund me",
      "If you're a pro looking for a super streamlined investment app with all the bells and whistles, look elsewhere. Stash is a no-nonsense long haul investment tool with educational media for people who want to invest their money without having to invest their lives in chasing market statistics. I love their no-nonsense approach to simple investing, and I plan to stick with them for the long haul",
      "It is true giving it 3 stars for now only because I don't see how you can withdraw the funds from your investments into your bank card if needed especially in these times unlike your competitor app (Acorns) just went to check it out and you could withdraw from your invested funds into your bank account with them. Do you think that is a wise financial option for the app user there's an obvious wall there to get to my funds if need be help me understand what is this overlooked fact please",
      "Awesome app. Great for beginners wanting to learn about investing as well as seasoned vets. Their FB page group is one of the most respectful and helpful bunch of ppl I've met online thus far. The only reason I didn't rate five stars is there are still some small glitches myself and others are experiencing from time to time. So there is a little room for improvement, but these are minor compared to the extensive and expansive options this app offer's, along with a strong support FB group.",
      "DON'T GET STASH!! They locked my already-existing account months ago for no reason. Made me jump through hoops to unlock it (uploading docs). The upload page didn't work. Support is awful; once they hung up on me. I was told to email the docs. I did. Nothing. When I call, they say they need more docs or more time to review them. (Why?) I just sent my ss card and they're saying the res is bad, but higher res won't email. Excuses! I still have no access to my portfolio at all and no recourse."

      "A lot of changes need to be made, for example, when you're saving a card, the button should be deactivated till the whole process either fails or succeds, also after I saved 10k, I got an error message and then tried later, still got an error message, just to be debited twice even though I only planned to save 10k, I ended up adding 20k. You still need to test your app for different scenarios",
      "I'm really enjoying this app, it really makes me wanna keep saving and saving. I highly recommend it to anyone that struggles with saving. I also love the interest I get just for saving with them on a daily basis, better than keeping it in my bank account that they end up taking unnecessary maintenance fees. I'm saving till the end of 2022, so I haven't tried withdrawing yet, so I'll probably update on this in 2 years time. üòÉ",
      "The app is so easy to use and stress free... The only issue i have is the charges... If u want to buy a mutual fund there is a fee 1.5% charged on the amount u want to purchase and that looks small but it gets big when u are investing big... And also the charge for withdrawal... I really dont see the use in it.",
      "I love how interactive the app feels and the clean interface. Please, can you implement the function of multiple stash. I am sure a lot of people would love that idea. I wanted to save my friend's money in a separate stash but I could not do that. Thanks in advance.",
      "Cool app with a sleek interface and smooth operation. But I think the minimum maturity date for savings should be reduced from 3 months. What if I want to be accessing my savings on a monthly basis? I think having a month as the minimum maturity date for daily savings will be cool..."

      "So far, so good! I've received my advanced after being asked a bunch of questions including asking your SSN just letting you know. They do ask that you put back at least $1 for what they call a rainy day fund which is withdrawn from your account attached monthly as well. I have not however used the Gold feature of the app, which actually asks that you expend more money to interact with that and I don't need that feature anyway.",
      "I have been using this app for about a year before deciding to rate it, and it definitely deserves a great rating. Using the app you have your own savings account accessible from your phone. You can set up multiple folders and decide which you want your money to go into and how much you want. You can set up an automatic transfer where Albert will pull a small portion of funds from your checking account and put it into your Albert account. Those are just 2 perks to this app, check it out.",
      "It's been almost 2 weeks, and their apps' system has not updated my account to use instant. They keep saying \"wait 2-3 business days\". Whilst telling me that \" our system usually fix this error in the timeframelisted above. But this situation is going to take a week. This happened right after they approved me for $75. The system somehow works when they charged my card the monthly fee ü§îü§î . This app is doing some illegal stuff. And needs to be shut down. Until their system can work properly.",
      "Albert is very straightforward and easy to understand and use. They have a lot of cool features that you can take advantage of, and some that you normally would have to pay for at traditional banks to be able to utilize, but are free with Albert. Very convenient and a great job creating it. On another note: Finally a competitor to Dave. Don't get me wrong, they are both incredibly apps, my thoughts are that competition drives innovation which means more awesome features for the users to enjoy.",
      "I have had this app for a few months and I love it. It doesn't say it will advance me money I am not qualified for, like the other applications. It asks what my longterm goals are, it sets up a rainy day fund for me as requested, but they look at my paychecks and what bills are coming out and what I can spare and puts it in there for me which is nice. By far the best app of this nature I have used. Actually this is the first google app I think I have ever left a review for."

Too risky to put your money into an app that glitches so much!!! Now, I don't know if I'll ever get my money back and that's almost $100!!! Plus you never win anything on their games. They were fun to play at first but after having this app for years and not winning anything but 5 cents, I'm extremely disappointed...",
      "A literal waste of time & space! I will begin by saying that this app takes up 712.1 MB worth of space in my phone (& I clean out my cache regularly!)! If that alone isn't enough, I'll add the fact that you'd have better luck hitting up your local casino! The winnings are peanuts & primarily on the days of deposits. The aim here is to get you hooked on the \"gambling\" aspect of it hoping you'll deposit one after another. They make it sound SO MUCH better than is really the case!",
      "I was hopeful bc customer service seems to answer quickly but they never actually fix any issues, do NOT use your card to get any instant transfers bc they will take the instant transfer but then they will hold your money for 2-5 days , I cant ever link any bank, their system rejects it , this has also gone ignored along with a request to close my account entirely, huge disappointment",

      "Awesome app. Definitely helps that stupid loophole of \" to have good credit, you have to have credit already in order to build credit\". This app and many others alike help young people like me get started on building credit out of nothing. Very happy with it. The credit card though, is there anyway to increase the credit without paying off the balance just yet? The whole point is keep paying over the year or two to build said credit, but a higher credit limit would be nice.",
      "My score has gone up 90 points in the last 3-4 months with this. I love how simple it is and I've told so many people about it. I recommend this if you're looking for a low-cost payment to increase your credit. It's not so much about how much you pay, it's the history of on time payments that help. I chose to pay the lowest amount for 2 years, by the end I'll have 2 years of on time payments.",
      "This is the most amazing app ever for anyone who needs to build/rebuild their credit. I had filled ch. 7 bankruptcy and been discharged about a year ago now. Needless to say, my credit was looking rough. Now, after 2 months of payments, credit is up 136 points! I don't know how it works, but it works and that's all I care about. Amazing service being provided here with equal opportunities for all.",
      "Since I was already working on my credit prior to getting the CD (Dec 19) and CC (Feb 20) thru them, I can't say for sure which did what or anything at all but my credit has gone up at the minimum 50 points already! But the app is very useful and user friendly. Has an answer for pretty much everything I had a question regarding. I have the $150 12 month loan!",
      "My credit went up a couple points after opening account. The thing that i do not like is the daily withdrawls that come out if my account. It is only pennies daily but after a year this will add up. I am sure it is some kind of interest or fees. I will finish off the term of the loan and will most likely be done with it but anything can happen. I have only had this account for two months. So a little early to tell"

      "So far the worst of the cash back apps I've used. Selected rebates/cash back options disappear shortly after adding them to your list, half the time they don't honor the rebates. Actually filed a rebuttal on one claim they denied where the product was clearly on the receipt, even circled the item on the receipt, which showed up clear as day and was within their requirements for redemption, and they declined it a second time. Don't waste your time on this app. Would've given a 0 star if I could.",
      "Can't earn money on this app anymore. It used to be easier but now there seems to be less diversity on what rebates are offered. It's always the same products, which are things I've never heard of or things I don't buy. The stuff I use has been taken off the app. Wish they would add different product offers",
      "Had the app for 3 years and never earned a check because the items are always the same. Maxed out at $10.50 and then my balance magically fell to $2 Great if you use Atkins and a few other unheard of items but not so useful if you don't buy the few select items they offer. Good luck. I give up wasting memory for this app & checking in for savings on any item I may use. Have other apps with more variety suited to my needs.",
      "Not much choice on the app for about 1-2 years. When it just came out was way better. I barely can found some deals to use. Whenever I found something immidiematly gone. 0 remaining so I can't use it again. I hope they can pull in more products and quantities for users to really get this app useful.",
      "This app is very limited and does not have much to offer when you go to the store or to get gas it only makes you go to certain gas stations which is the worst wish they would update the app to get more items available out there that people buy this why I use Ibotta it has a lot to over when I go shopping"

The automation of this app is really helpful for me, I can look at my bank account and know that the money I need to save is gone.

I have been using this app for quite a while now but to use it now, I have to first get an ICICI account which is ridiculous. Thought of something above expectation bt this has gone below. Sad to say that I have to search for similar options.",
      "Sir old app was too good. As I can study these moves are just taken for profit issue. We were saving quicky and frequently on older version. I do not want to open an account in icici bank. I am very sad after seeing this big update. Plz do use older version of wizely.",
      "Used to be more accessible now it more restrictive to ICICI only ! No option provided for non ICICI user Went there with all right documentation including Aadhar , pan proof of address and account opening cheque was provided they didn't accept. What I learnt was that the website said 10,000 was the minium for opening a basic savings account but when I reached they said 20,000 even though there website ICICI says that you can start an account @ 10,000 Rupees I had 12000.",
      "Monthly back i used this app and it was good because i used for saving purpose. But now new updates came and only ICICI account holders can use. Help other account holders to use as well. I'm unable to login because i don't have ICICI bank account.",
      "Earlier Wizely can be used by everyone. After update Wizely can be used by ICICI customers only. What is the necessity of having Wizely if I have a savings bank account?. It is forced to open a bank account with ICICI. It is unacceptable. I've used this app for the past several months. But I am not satisfied with the update."

We will try our best to get the feature added for you.<br><br>New Feature by popular demand:-<br>You now have an option to save a set amount that you define over any of the payment frequencies.  I.e. Save $10 every week for 52 weeks.<br><br>We are constantly looking to improve this App for you! Please give us any constructive feedback and we will see what we can do :)<br>Enjoy your savings!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: This app is designed to make tracking your savings easier and DOES NOT have or request access to your banking/savings information.",

      "It takes a long time to earn rewards because maybe 40% of the receipts it has a problem reading and when you try to edit, there's no way to do so, so you lose those points. Good concept, just needs more work to make it easier and smoother to use . However, I did earn $5 from Amazon after just a couple mths of scanning receipts, so it's worth keeping, for now.",
      "I love this app. Have been using it for over a year. The only thing is the bug needs to be fixed that has occurred in the last month or so where it doesn't recognize the store, time, date & total on most of the receipts I submit regardless of where they are from and I have to manually enter this info. Gets aggrevating. Fix this issue and it's perfect !",
      "I see people complaining about how long it takes to earn points, but I haven't really noticed that. It's free money, so I'm really not going to complain about that. The problems I do have are related to the app itself. It crashes constantly. I have to restart at least twice per receipt. My second complaint is about ereceipts. I didn't really miss this feature until I got the email that it was available. I got super excited and tried to use it,only to read the fine print and see it was iOS only.",
      "Fix your system. Still not scanning receipts properly and giving you points for certain items you buy. Scanned 2 tickets on 1 March and each stated that it was missing store name, date, and amount. Each of these tickets had this information. I manually put in this information on one ticket and it gave me 25 points and not the extra points on certain items. This is an ongoing problem. Getting ready to pull the plug on this unreliable rewards system. Fix it.",
      "Pretty good app. I do notice some of my receipts need review that's ok. It needs to be clearly scanned so they can see the whole receipt. Store name, date and time are most import. You have 14 days to upload them. I hope to see myself actually get some free items or money off. Will come back when I get more points and give it a 5 star.(my receipts honestly were very clear once submitted you cant re-take or upload or fix maybe you can change that, I think that's a good idea to fix or change )"

      "Like the app but it gives me the blues when I was FORCED to set up my loyalty cards whether I wanted to or not. It didn't allow me to and it asked me for the phone number I used to sign up for my loyalty cards! I don't remember because that was so many years ago and I've switched phone numbers anyway",
      "The Camera is blurry in the app via my samsung galaxy s9+. It did the same when the phone belonged to my son. It has since been reset and reinstalled, but the blurriness persists. I have to upload copies of the receipt from the my phones image gallery, which seems to rotate the receipt sideways no matter how I orient the image in gallery. Please fix. Oh, the camera isn't blurry when I use in other apps or with the phones camera app.",
      "Printing from mobile is hit or miss. Sometimes the app recognizes my printer, most of the time not. It has become so incredibly frustrating that I'll likely delete the app. Customer service hasn't been a help, except in misunderstanding the issue or sending links to articles I've already read.",
      "Worst app ever. I've made shopping trips just to use their coupons - I properly submitted all 3 receipts and every time I get a rejected \"action needed\" notice, telling me to rescan my receipt. If I use the camera software that comes in the app, it's garbled and fuzzy. If I retake it, it gets rejected. I've purposely bought several things ONLY becauee they were on this app but never get the savings. I reached out to customer service 2 weeks ago but no one responds to help. Terrible app!",
      "Cool app. Works wonders if you actually remember to scan the receipt. Lol"

      "Like the app but it gives me the blues when I was FORCED to set up my loyalty cards whether I wanted to or not. It didn't allow me to and it asked me for the phone number I used to sign up for my loyalty cards! I don't remember because that was so many years ago and I've switched phone numbers anyway",
      "The Camera is blurry in the app via my samsung galaxy s9+. It did the same when the phone belonged to my son. It has since been reset and reinstalled, but the blurriness persists. I have to upload copies of the receipt from the my phones image gallery, which seems to rotate the receipt sideways no matter how I orient the image in gallery. Please fix. Oh, the camera isn't blurry when I use in other apps or with the phones camera app.",
      "Printing from mobile is hit or miss. Sometimes the app recognizes my printer, most of the time not. It has become so incredibly frustrating that I'll likely delete the app. Customer service hasn't been a help, except in misunderstanding the issue or sending links to articles I've already read.",
      "Worst app ever. I've made shopping trips just to use their coupons - I properly submitted all 3 receipts and every time I get a rejected \"action needed\" notice, telling me to rescan my receipt. If I use the camera software that comes in the app, it's garbled and fuzzy. If I retake it, it gets rejected. I've purposely bought several things ONLY becauee they were on this app but never get the savings. I reached out to customer service 2 weeks ago but no one responds to help. Terrible app!",
      "Cool app. Works wonders if you actually remember to scan the receipt. Lol"

      "Waste of time. It takes weeks for cash back to be added to your account...if you are credited at all. When you submit an inquiry to see where your cashback dollars are (which is a challenge of its own), you get error messages and can't complete the process. Rakuten, If 0% back on a $500 purchase from Amazon was the special offer, you nailed it. Don't waste your time or data.",
      "Have been using this app for a while (when it was ebates). Love that you get cash back on purchases, however for EVERY Amazon purchase, you have to manually add your purchases.. It's ALWAYS been like this. The missing cash back is quickly added to my account when submitted,, but it's just annoying because I do almost half of my online shopping on Amazon.",
      "Bad for In-Store shopping. This app is more online based, connecting your online shopping accounts and purchases in order to give you cash back. This app also only allows one bank account to be connected, which isn't very flexible for a family. Also, if you want to take pictures of your receipts and your family's receipts, this app is not for you. There is no \"receipt picture taking\" option since this app is more focused on providing coupons while you shop online; then gives u cash back online.",
      "So far so good, there is a few months in between pay periods but at least you have a chance to build up your funds towards a refund check or PayPal. U receive a small% back from shopping, while using this app before you buy. And i love that you can choose from sooo many different stores to shop at. Thank you rakuten(Ebates) app.",
      "The app works like someone developed it in 2000. You can't see anything...at minimal you should be able to review your purchases through the app. Extremely frustrsting! I have the latest version.. I'm going back to my original way of purchasing. NOT WORTH THE FRUSTRATION"

      "It's great app that has all of functions that I want. I'm happy with it and have been using it for a couple of years. But there're some bugs along the way of usage. Eg. App delayed synchronizing with my bank account and eventually stopped synchronzing, sometimes when I tried to edit my wallets the app pulled me back to the previous menu. And there's one time weired incident which is the most frustrating one is all of my records had gone away which I'm not sure whether I did something wrong.",
      "I don't know what the issue is, I can sign in but the first sync always failed. 'unfortunately, we are unable to fully download your data. please try again later.' Need to several trial of sign in to success. Then after minutes using it suddenly I signed out and need to sign in again. And the issue repeat. I plan to try this app because there's interesting feature such as web sync. But I think I'll stick with my app that I havd been using for now because of this issue",
      "Better than others.... Debt manager is one unique feature.... But, one DRAWBACK is when I add transaction as transfer from x acc y acc, tha transfered amount is considered as EXPENSE in x acc... And due to which it shows monthly expense higher by including all transfer amount... In case this will be fixed, then this is the best app to track daily, monthly expenses.... Because of that one drawback I left this app.",
      "I paid for a premium user. Now I have problem with App synchronisation. Most data recorded was mixed up and all of the sudden it it was all gone. Okay, I decide to adjust the balance again to start over again but.....again the App start synchronizing again. Can you please fix this problem. It's so annoying! I have paid for this.",
      "From a premium users view: For the amount you pay the app looks outdated, No materialistic design, Not enough icons to choose from, No dark mode, Looks dull. Important features that's missing: * When expenses is added to 'A' wallet & later u want to move it to 'B' wallet that not possible. * Credit cards are considered completely separate from the main wallet. This should not be it because at the end of the day. Credit card bill is payed from the main wallet. With correction it's a 5* app"

      "Like everyone else, losing money due to app issues. I went as far as to remove the app, download again, shut down, restart, and still having the same issue at this point. I can access any page on the app except the trade page, in till after 11:30 am. I attempt to go to the page and all that comes up is the green header bar and a blank white page.",
      "It was great! Until it crashes. And then it crashes every morning. And then it crashes on the busiest, most volatile day of the market and doesnt open for the rest of the day, and refuses to let people view anything in the app thanks to a hot patch. Seems everyday is getting worse on this app and they seem to offer no statement. Many people thinking about a class action lawsuit for gross negligence",
      "Takes forever for your transfer to come through; about 7 business days before your account sees the charge. Way too long! Then when it was supposed to complete, they say there was a problem with the transfer, that it was cancelled and I was charged a $9 fee. I checked my account in the day they sent that notification and had enough funds to complete the transfer. Opened a case and Eduardo said to get back to them in a month when my bank statement is generated so they can review. Ridiculous!",
      "So I figured I would give this app a try. Not looking good. It kept telling me it's losing connection, and then its having a server issue. Right after I put ALL my information in. Wont let you look at stocks. Just sends you to a blank page. So far this has been a horrible experience. Not sure I would invest money into this if you cant even navigate the app properly.",
      "Superb interface - Garbage Stability: This app is by far the most intuitive and beginner friendly option I've encountered. Unfortunately, the stability of the trading system is straight up garbage. Users were locked out of their account for the entire day of March 2nd, 2020; and the first half of March 3rd, 2020; during which the S&P 500 bounced up 8% from it's previous weeklong plummet. Do not trust this company with critical day to day trades, they have no qualms about shutting down the system"

      "I used this app on my S9+ and it worked flawlessly. I switched to a Galaxy S20 Ultra and now I get the message that it was built for a different version of Android OS. Now I have to switch from IG after clicking \"Copy Link\" to Fast Save app and turn off FastSave Service and turn it back on for the picture/video to download. Please fix for One UI 2.1 / Android 10 and I will gladly give this 5 stars again. This app is by far the best IG downloader when it works correctly.",
      "Huhu. I gave you 5 stars because this app is the best for me, so far. You don't necessarily have to go back to the app to download the posts. It automatically saves them just by copying the URL. But lately, I am unable to use it as my phone requires updating the app's version. I'm seriously hoping you'd hear me out and be able to make this work on a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I'll definitely re-install this app.",
      "It was great at first. I'd even go as far as to say it was/is amazing. The only problem is that you have to to open this app then go straight to instagram through this app otherwise the downloaded pictures/videos wont show up in your gallery. Now my biggest problem is that, once I turn it on and use it to go to IG, my IG freezes instantly...like my IG will be fine until I decide that I want to start downloading things and as soon as i turn it on and go to IG with it then thats it for my IG.,",
      "Edit - since the latest Android update, FastSave advises it may not work on this latest version and to contact the developer. I've noticed that I have to repeatedly go out of FsstSave, end the app, close out of Instagram as when you select copy link, nothing appears in FsstSave unless you do the above, each time! Will there be an update to this app to accommodate the latest Android update?",
      "At the beginning when I downloaded the app, my downloads saved in my gallery immediately and so easy. Now nothing I choose saves in my gallery, not even under the app in saved video or pics. I even uninstalled the app and downloaded it again but still the same. When I copy and share it send a link via social media but nothing saves so I am disappointed with regards to that, not sure what changed!"

      "It's a good app. A little hard to navigate and could benefit from some kind of AI to walk you through the initial set up and maybe stick with you a few months to get you completely lined out. Then maybe greet you again periodically to let you know about updates and give you some tips. Also the plus version is too expensive in my opinion just to link bank accounts and drag and drop feature mostly. Anyway it's what I am using at the moment to supplement my pen and paper budget.",
      "Waste of money. It worked seamlessly for the first month and now it does not sync with my bank unless i sign out, uninstall the app, sign back in, and put in a new security code every time. And now this week, even that doesnt work. The app freezes and stops working. Ive emailed the Ramsey solutions people and they flat out refuse to refund me my money. Update: Still a waste of money! Now my transactions sync again but 3x per one! So I get to manually delete 2/3 of the transactions! Yay me!",
      "I really like most things about this app. I recommend it because it is a useful tool for planning and tracking spending. However, I do not like the way the line items called \"funds\" are accounted for. I love seeing that I have an \"everydollar budget,\" but when I have a fund, it will still say EveryDollar Budget even if I went over in every category. There should be a popup that says \"You just overspent your budget. Please adjust.\"",
      "A great app! It would be greater if we could take a pic of receipt within the app. It's difficult for the user to confirm the budget category of each item if the user looses the receipt. Another idea: user scans the receipt and then app provides a recommended category for items, once the user confirms, the info gets placed into the current budget. It also needs percentage for each category. Budget categories based on percentage is at the core of the plan. Doesn't make sense to not have them.",
      "I've been using this off and on to track my budget which helped, but I've never really followed it and didn't enjoy manually entering expenses. I recently upgraded to the plus version which links your bank account. This has been magical! I'm now staying on budget and can look at what is remaining in each category wherever I am. Thankful for this app since it has kept me on track for paying off debt!"

Hmm...we realize you&#39;re not the target demo here, but at least now you have the option! Also, we made a ton of solid bug fixes, such as:<br>‚Ä¢ Now overzealous spell checkers won&#39;t try and correct non-user editable content<br>‚Ä¢ Prevented category switching when a keypad is active<br>‚Ä¢ Added a much scarier category deletion warning message<br>‚Ä¢ And more!",

      "I've been using YNAB for a couple years now and it's taken my control of finances to a new level. For years I was using a spreadsheet focused on ensuring I had enough cash in the bank to pay bills. It resulted in me spending most of my paycheck paying for things I bought last month on a credit card. It took a couple years, but using YNAB, I was able to get this under control and am now setting aside my current paycheck to pay for next months bills as well as building an emergency fund.",
      "Very useful and have been using it for about 10 months. Though I was (or so I thought) good with my money, this app brought it to another level. I would however like to see some better metrics and data on categories and places spent. I'm not sure if it's available on the web version, but it would be nice to get more of the web features over to the app",
      "I fought my wife's drive to embrace this software/app and their method... I'm just gonna be honest, it's amazing. This time last year I had saved up a couple hundred bucks of my 'allowance' and I was pretty proud. I wasn't using YNAB or anything to manage my spending monies. After spending everything on a trip last year and wanting to plan ahead to go again, I started using YNAB and I've not only saved for the trip, I have savings above the measly couple hundred bucks + money for whatever.",
      "The only budgeting software that I regularly look at and use. Nothing else has worked for me. The app is fun, and the development team and staff are genuinely invested in the success of their customers. I have saved more money with the help of YNAB than I ever have been before. I still overspend, but at least YNAB actually makes me feel bad about it, while being incredibly feature-rich, pleasing to the eye, and - dare I say it - fun to use! I'm a dedicated fan now.",
      "Love, love, love this app! An accountant friend turned me on to it and while it was a shift in thinking and took a bit to get used to I wouldn't do it any other way. Finally able to save money this year. I watched a great youtube tutorial that made it all make sense. Kinda just think of it as envelopes for your $ but in app form. Also, the dev team is super responsive to issues, great product, great company."

I would suggest that instead of tapping and tapping the + or minus button, we could just type the exact amount we want. Also the app exits easily just by tapping the back on my phone which I end up opening it again. Please hear these out for the improvement of your app. :)",
      "The new update is very tedious. Editing the amounts in a specific goal does not have an option to just type the amount, you have to press the + or - to do this. Just imagine if you want to do a million in one denomination.",
      "The new interface is not user friendly. You have to scroll down on each denomination and press the buttons beside to add money. It takes so much time to scroll down. The old interface was simple yet was easy to navigate around. The settings seems to be gone and I don't get the purpose of using a share button on something that involves money.",
      "The new update SUCKS!! I have been using this app for a long time now and this update is NOT USER FRIENDLY. I tried to reset my goal because I completed my last goal. I can't input the number goal for each denomination, I have to tap the - and + button for it to reach the number I prefer, which is very difficult as the default after you reset is 217!!! BRING BACK THE OLD INTERFACE.",
      "What a huge drawback you did with your update! I used it for years now but only got disappointed after the update. The app now has become an ad app not anymore the ipon app we knew. Such a waste. You call this solution but the way? Tskk. But thanks for the creating the previous ones. It was good until the update."

That's about the only rub -- not all links are clipped, and it doesn't let you know when they aren't. But a GREAT READER."

      "I love the simplicity of not needing to put in my income coz tbh I find that too stressful considering that I'm the type who would randomly find some money in an old bag. But this app is quite complicated. I wish it was easier to add subcategories and name them. I also wish that the icons were presented in a matter that makes it seem less overwhelming. Maybe emoji type rid style would be nice.",

What is this app for if im unable to test it for adding catatories?, how do i know the paid version will work. Thanks but no thanks. There's better apps to be had that allow a for better try out.",

      "I really want to use this app with my partner, its exactly what we've been looking for - the problem is that while my partner, who uses an iphone, can set her envelopes' budget periods to be every two weeks, I dont have the same option on the android version of the app, only monthly and yearly! Its very annoying, and preventing me from using it effectively as my income is fortnightly - are there plans for this option to be added to the android version of the app too?",
      "Best budgeting app I've used by far. Very quick to load data. Doesn't ask for all of my personal information. Doesn't allow all transaction types from the app (income, debt payments, envelope filling) which is a bummer, but I use them infrequently enough that I can use the desktop version. Much better experience than Mint overall.",
      "Love the browser version but this App is seriously lacking. Can't see envelope balances when filling, splitting charges is a nightmare. The list goes on. It's like no one who developed the app ever actually tried to use it. It would be 1 star if I didn't like the browser version so much but seriously considering switching due to the app.",
      "The desktop website is great. However, the Android app is sorely lacking in features. The app completely ignores envelope groups, unlike the website which groups the envelopes in both the reports and in the envelopes list and allows you to collapse groups you don't want to see temporarily. I wish I could filter the envelopes on groups and filter transactions on accounts in the app. If I click on an envelope in the reports, I wish to see the corresponding transactions in that time range.",
      "Great app but I would like to know how to use it more effectively . I can't seem to tick off what I have paid in monthly expenses . So my income balance always shows a plus amount. It's not a realistic reflection of my money."

      "This is a very fun and engaging game. If you want to get the best out of it without paying, watch the ads. It's annoying, but it pays dividends. There is a point when the game ceases to be enjoyable, however. Right around level 170, the first few zombies are ridiculously difficult to kill, and are basically invincible for the first few seconds. This isn't a death sentence. However the boss in these levels is so overpowered that it becomes impossible to kill them without using all your powerups",

      "Disappointed with the feature of not being able to restore your data from an older device. I was consistently maintaining a tab of all my expenses on a daily basis for the last 7 months. However, my phone was stolen a couple of days back. Now, after installing the app on my new phone, I'm not able to login and view all my expenses. The whole purpose of using this app is defeated if I cannot login to another device and view my expenses. Very disappointed.",
      "I rarely leave comments but I love the app. It's smooth and easy to use. I've been using this app for like two weeks already and it really helped me track my expenses which also helped me save up. My only problem is that I can't sign in or connect the app to my facebook or gmail. I hope you can do something about it!",
      "Great, easy to use app to just track where your money goes. What does annoy me: you cannot set date range. We don't all get paid on the first or last of the month. If my month runs 15th - 14th, I am unable to properly track monthly expenses. Wish this would be fixed. Then 5 stars from me!",
      "Such a great UI. The best interface and convenient to use. Had fallen in love with the whole operation. But despite may negative reviews the developers are ignorant of the login issue. Please atleast respond so we know you're working on a fix. Don't ruin your whole product just because of such a simple issue. Please fix it. I myself am a developer and know how important a product is to a developer. Please care about it. And care about the what your consumers think.",
      "Love this app. I am only just getting to really use it now I have moved out. It has an easy pie chart to work out where all your money is going. It will also have the amount you spent and a percentage. I learnt 46% is a bit high for my household bills. Bit have paid a one off insurance for a car. So this will vary monthly. I'm not the best with money and find It hard to save. It would be a good idea to be able to add 2 savers accounts. As I don't mix my main account with the savings ones."

      "Can't find a way to stop notifications. I hate getting daily notifications about stuff will not use for another several years. My daughter is 4, she won't be logging in by herself anytime soon. App seems pretty cool other than the annoying notifications.",
      "Honestly such a brilliant app. I paid the extra ¬£24 for the year premium and it's worth every penny in terms of the amount of motivation it's given my son to be more conscious of helping around the house. It's really great for him to be able to physically see what he needs to do and be able to tick it off. Then with the pocket money he gets, he can set his own goals and manage his own money into it. Which allows him a certain amount of independence, whilst also leaving me able to control it too.",
      "This is an amazing app, well worth paying the subscription for the debit card. You can set chores for your child and extra jobs which they then complete on the phone, even send photos to prove. This then adds a percentages to their monthly allowance or you manage that yourself. You then add tje allowance from your card to your child's, you manage where they can spend (online, stores, ATM withdrawal). Their pin and CVC is ONLY stored in the app and have the power to freeze the card from the app.",
      "We downloaded this app with the hope that it would encourage our sons to help with chores. It was great at first, but then we ran into an issue with it not being able to save any changes we wanted to make to the allowance amount and frequency. I reached out to the support team and over a period of a week, they kept in touch with me until the bug was corrected. The app is great, but their customer service is amazing! Thanks to Alice and the rest of the team for working to make this app great!",
      "Requires additional subscription to track 'jobs'/chores to earn allowance. Uses their own payment screen rather then Google, and wouldn't successfully process with either of two known good card numbers. At this point I'm concerned I made a mistake in giving my card information to an unknown app and will need to cancel them for possible fraud."

      "Works well when it links accounts. It booted one of my major accounts off and now my information is incorrect and incomplete (for 6 Months). I have not been able to successfully contact support and resolve this issue. App is ideal otherwise. I'm looking, and no updates available. I dont know what to do. No phone support. When I did the chat support, no resolution.",
      "Post install setup flow is a bad experience. There is a screen where you can select the types of use cases you plan on leveraging the app for. I was planning on clicking a few but when I clicked the first one (credit score) it automatically navigated into the credit score setup flow. Upon completion it didn't take me back to select another one. So I then I linked my bank account and the account balances were incorrect. The app allowed me to unlink my bank account but not my credit score account.",
      "Love this app! I already knew about the website years ago and loved using them to choose credit cards. But this app really is a step up. It helps me keep track of my credit score, see my accounts, how I'm spending money, home valuation details and it give me information about how to improve my credit.",
      "Illuminating, finally an app that hasn't tried to sell me something in the first 10 minutes and let me just organize my finances onto one app. The Robo Advisors send you to pointed articles, and they're sized to answer thoughtful questions without information overload. Highly recommend.",
      "Constantly disconnecting from my accounts. It is getting pretty bad to the point where every time I check something is needing reverification. Please fix your app so I can go back to giving it five stars."

      "The developer email does 't work when I tried to make contact over a mistake I made in paying 2 times for the app. But the app itself is a 4 star only on the basis that deluxe premium paid customers should have the option of 3 locations. But I do love the app but it would do well with some more tweaking to benefit those who are willing to pay for it. Even to give a few more ultra apps. VPN is all over the place, and Datally is free. So I'd welcome a little more. But thanks Samsung!",
      "Makes you think it is an official Samsung app. When it is indeed made by a 3rd party developer. The so called \"premium\" mode puts ads on your lockscreen when charging. Thought I liked it when I first installed then slowly grew to dislike. Just uninstalled. Find a better VPN app and hopefully Samsung will actually make an official vpn app.",
      "i have to admit this is an amazing app, and for some reason i get premium for free wich means everything unlocked no monthly payments and no in app ads only when you are charging you get a different lockscreen with a small add on the bottom. that's my only negative √°nd that you have to get used to the layout and what settings are located on wich tab but considering i got used to it realtively quick. i'd say this is the best vpn/datasaver.. out there i took a star off because ofc ads are a thing",
      "Not a bad app in general, puts a bunch of existing feature in one interface BUT the reason for 2 stars and uninstalling after I do review is, built in VPN block me from connecting with addresses i go to on a frequent basis. Legitimate sites with no questionable content. Have to minimize app, disconnect VPN , the go back and proceed. NONSENCE",
      "Installed it, seems good. The app drains a lot of battery very quickly. The connection with the app activated is slow. Please fix it. Also if you uninstall the app and install it again, it doesn't have a history log."

      "Blocks apps even when on strong wifi connection. It's only supposed to block mobile data. I've also never seen the claimed feature that alerts you that you're trying to use a blocked app and asks if you want to unblock it temporarily. Laatly, every time I open the app, data saver has been turned off. I toggle it back on, but everytime I open it back up it's been turned off again. Ultimately unusable.",
      "Useless. This app uses data and collects your information for the purpose of advertising. It claims it can block Google from using data, nonsense. I had this on full block when i noticed Google app store has gobbled 200 megabyte of data in just a few minutes. I was using Glasseswire to monitor. You're best bet is to manually block apps from using data in the background and use Glasswire to monitor what's wasting your data in the background. By the way, there's no app that can fully block Google.",
      "Excellent, thanks to developer. Ever since I bought Samsung J4, my data just kept on \"vanishing \" even with their so called \"data saver \" on and background disabled .Need I say more, Data eye really protect our data, through its whatcful eye. The only minor issue ot seems as if when o switch off Mobil data on phone ,data eye also sleeps and those background apps start to be active, I might be wrong pls correct me if I'm mistake. Today I edit , I still hasn't got feed back, despite this review em",
      "Not too bad, but does not start automatically even when the option is set on. So it's mostly useless for many people. And an option to block separately the app in WiFi and data would be nicer. Your app needs improvement, I will give it a try again in a couple of years if you are still around.",
      "Pretty much does what it says and does it well. It can even block system connections, which really gives the user full control. If there would be anything I'd like improved, it would be the ability to have separate wifi and data settings for individual apps. As it is you can only block both our neither. Still great app."
