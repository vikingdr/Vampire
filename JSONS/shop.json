      "This app now always displays horizontally on my screen and will not rotate to display vertically. I have a note 4 and it is annoying I have to hold my phone horizontally when using this app. I don't have this issue with any other app. Deleting the app cache and stopping the app and rebooting phone did not fix this.",
      "Real PIMA 90 percent of the time. Seldom works correctly and loads slow. Support is absolutely terrible. Use Amazon, Best Buy or a carrier store unless you ABSOLUTELY have to use this app for something like a promo redemption. I just used it for my $200 credit from pre-ordering the S20 Ultra. Took 8 days to complete, and even with $200 worth of free stuff, it was barely worth the time, effort and trouble!",
      "Every time I try to pick a specific item by pressing \"get started\" for more details, I just get a blank screen. This is kind of useless. Your app is still terrible. Every time I try to look at anything beyond the main page I still just get a white screen. I did email and no one ever responded.",
      "I paid for the Samsung upgrade program when I purchased my S10+. However, I was not able to use it to upgrade to the S20. I paid the same price that was offered to all other pre-orders. Samsung customer service rep said it does not apply ??? Another misrepresentation (a big word for a lie) by Samsung USA.",
      "Horrible. Live chat with 3 different agents & still can't preorder Samsung Galaxy 20!+. I followed the directions from the agent which I cleared my cookies & cache then restarted my phone. Didnt work. Used 3 other browsers. It wouldn't login to my Verizon account. Originally it stated I get $180 - trade in & $185 Samsung Credit. Now it's $180 for the trade & $150 Samsung Credit. Used Firefox browser went through the order process & click for Verizon financing and it sent me to Affirm. No good"

      "I found the game very addictive. It has nice graphics, the game flow is pretty fast. Beside its component of crafting and selling, one also participates in adventure of his or hers heroes. The game also has some in-game lottery, various random events that in the way helps a player to accomplish goals. The difficulty levels might get stuck without options to change back or make harder. If you restart a game, it may fix the issue, but not always.",
      "Writing this again since the last review was removed. I down voted this because of the paywall you hit. It is $50 in order to craft wands and guns. Seriously... $50??? I don't mind putting 5-10 here and there into a game I am playing but that is ridiculous. Not to mention the cost of champions every few levels that would take months to grind for if you don't purchase. Otherwise, it's a good time killer. It is NOT worth the cost of a triple A published title game though. Extremely off-putting.",
      "My biggest issue is when I craft some items or go on a mission, then I come back to it, nothing was crafting and the mission I set up never got set up. It's been happening a lot over the last couple days. **EDIT**It looks like there might be a fix, I'll check it out and after a couple days I'll re-edit this review.",
      "I am really enjoying this game. It is fun, engaging, and there is always something to do. I like how you can customize almost everything and tailor the look of your shop to your own desires. I also enjoy how it seems you can do everything without selling out large amounts of money. However, I do wish there was a way to maybe close your store so you could have a moment to restock and organize your shelves without being pestered or losing customers.",
      "The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the fast track system. It still costs 10 diamonds even if there's only 2 minutes remaining, but at 11 minutes it costs 11 diamonds. I think that should be corrected. Also it'd be nice to see more graphics during the quest. Some fire balls or earth shards, Other than that, superb game. The quest system, the hero abilities, everything really is fantastic. It's the only game I've actually kept for months at a time. The p2p prices are great."

      "I found and purchased several Items that I can use at fabulous prices. At first I thought that they only carried things I would never use, but I found they have things for everyone. Try hitting the find icon and you will be amazed. Their selection is vast. I found things I need right away and placed an order. Then I searched and found hundreds of things that I want, so after I pay my Bill's I can't wait to come back for more.",
      "Good, just frustrating and time waster at times.You think that you bought an item and then they tell you that you did not get it. Delivery is expensive, but overall a good experience. It doesn't really let you search for what are you looking for, so that is why I give 3 starts, and because of delivery. Quicker to purchase on other sites. Good, because you can see lots of different items if you have the time.",
      "Whenever I try to order my items, the transcation doesn't go through. It either says \"oops, try again\" or \"please contact your credit card..\" I am using a prepaid gift card and nothing is working. Not to mention you guys accept gift cards so what is there that is not going well? I typed in my information correctly and yet, it's still not accepting it. Plus, the prices on the items are off. For example, a shirt will say $7 but when you select your size, the price increases.",
      "It's a good app where you can get things pretty cheap. I wish there was an option to get rid of the items you already have bought on there. It'll pop up on the newsfeed more than once and it gets pretty annoying at times. It would also be great if when you click on something cause you don't know what it is, for that reason alone and not wanting to buy it, that it wouldn't pop up on your newsfeed anymore. That gets annoying real quick cause most of the time I don't want that item.",
      "I really dont know what to say about this app. It has been showing me \"payment pending\"since yesterday even though I have given my complete card details and everything!! It's really disappointing because it's my first purchase with Wish and they are already giving me a very poor service!It really glitches so many times!!!"

      "Update: app sucks. When not let me in and keeps giving me an error code. So tired of this inconsistency and being locked out. SNAP!! it locks you out of your messages and then asks you to register as if you don't have an account. I've only been using this for about six months and it's already happened three times. Can't reply to people's messages. Missed sales. very frustrating. Not sure why they aren't fixing this problem because according to other people it's been going on a long time",
      "No support on bugs at all. I do not get audio notifications for items I'm selling. example: a person messages me wanting to buy an item, I see it FOUR HOURS later. response .metrics/times are way up to an hour because of this bug. could have lost the sale and look like a clown for not responding when OFFERUP NEVER NOTIFIED ME. What's up guys? This sucks. Update: There literally is NO support. Just random comments trying to look like they are actively doing something. they definitely aren't",
      "The app works well for the most part and does have some consistently great deals. After their last update I had to reinstall the app in order to do a new post, which has me a bit concerned on their regression testing process. Just an annoyance, I would still recommend folks trying it out.",
      "Seems like it could have been a good marketplace with good deals but you can't actually buy anything. Sellers just never respond to even full price offers or worse accept then cancel the sale. Days or even weeks wasted. Unreliable or inactive sellers/listings need to be removed. Too frustrating as is, uninstalled.",
      "OfferUp used to be so good. Now it's riddled with bugs, scams, and overall just a terrible experience. For the past year I've been unable to post from mobile data and now I can't log in. No way to contact support, not that they do anything anyway. Time to ditch OfferUp and find a better app to sell on."

      "Works most of the time. Been getting harder to get walk in kicks. And I've notified them, but nothing happens still. Doe the most part, I love it, and it gives some great gift cards. But I think it needs to give you the kicks you miss out on when you tell them you didn't receive them.",
      "I'm so tired of this app. I haven't been able to receive walk-in kicks larger than 25 since the end of February. Anything more than that, and the store won't even acknowledge that I'm there. I've done laps around these stores, left and come back, to no avail. I've missed out on at least 1000 kicks worth because of this. I've reported, I've emailed: no response. The app is just taking up space on my phone at this point.",
      "Love watching videos. Helps me learn of new products. Enjoy scanning items, when they are available at the stores that I go to. I earn points and will keep stores competitive on pricing. Plus I get kicks!!! Win, win for everyone. Wish i lived near more participating stores.",
      "This app is getting really irritating. Some of the stores I go to are not very close and after I get there I can't get the kicks. Marshall's did not give me 150 and now not even available at all. Also TJ Maxx. I tried to email my frustration but it said not a valid email and it's the only email I have. OK I tried to email Shopkicks again and it said my email is invalid. This is getting ridiculous not worth the trouble. Looked in my sent emails and it said it was sent. 🤔",
      "For the past 3 weeks I have been having trouble with the Walk in point for stores like TJ Maxx, Carter's, and Oshkosh. I have reported the problems n I have yet to receive my pints n now today I am having the same problem with Marshall's. Very frustrating cause I live 45 to an hour from these stores so it's not like I can come everyday. Also very upsetting when u can not get anyone to help because supposedly they r doing upgrades to there help support. Ready to cash in drop this App"

I also like the lack of greedy adds. There is no stress to pay money but I will since I have enjoyed this game for over 100 hours",
      "The game itself is good. I would highly recommend it. 5 stars for game - 10 for in game offers. Don't expect to get the gems rewards . I have played for a couple of years but after the trouble i am having trying to get my gems from a offer I am thinking of giving up. The rewards of free gems are run via tapjoy and shop heroes say it's nothing to do with them. Easy solution stop being paid by tapjoy to advertise in your game and award a few gems for daily log in.",
      "I am a returning player, years ago I played on kongregate. The game is great and it has added new events, but it definitely hasn't improved much on quality of life changes or user friendly interface. Fusion cauldron: the starting and finishing animations are way too long, stupid but frustrating. Interrupts whatever I am doing with a whole screen pop-up that fusion finished. Trade house could have a comparison on price difference between offers and requests. Shows the profit that can be made.",
      "The best mobile game I've ever played. No intrusive ads (you can CHOOSE to watch ads to speed up certain processes), long gameplay and raids on the weekends. Possible to play on your own and easy to pick up after a break. Has only crashed when my internet connection has been bad. Very, nice art and atmosphere.",

There are a lot of retailers out there carrying the same items. Target's prices aren't that great anyway. Although I periodically buy things from Target online, I mostly avoid it.",
      "Right now, the \"offers available\" prompt is very confusing to follow. I searched for a good 30 minutes for the, supposed, \"discount offer\" as a circle member before finally giving up and just placing my order. Target devs, you have a long way to go. Especially considering the fact that you're simply taking advantage of the fear and panic everyone is experiencing at this time in our lives. Please step your game up. We all need you. Be that beacon of hope you promised you'd be.",
      "I love this app! I can shop and add my savings at the end. I have different delivery options that are on the app. This is a great featurewith the store becauseI have a smallchild and I dont always want to get her out of the car if she is asleep. There are also times when I dont want to have to get dressed to go into the store for one item. It is amazing!",
      "I find it frustrating when the app freezes up and has to be closed and reopened frequently. I was unsure about the notations in red indicating a possible delay in that particular item being available.which is certainly understandable under the current conditions. Did that also mean that the current gift card offer might no longer be available as well?",
      "Have been using this for about 2 months now. It does just about everything that I need. Thanks! Update - love this app except for one thing - the search engine needs to be better. Even if you search for one specific item, it will bring back way too many different items. Update 3/11/20- love it, but PLEASE tune the search engine. Brings back way too many non-specific results."

      "It's easy to navigate, love the stuff they have but for some reason now, when I click on a product it doesn't show at the bottom similar products anymore. Idk if it's just my phone but point is, I don't like that. I like seeing similar options as it makes it easier to find things I like so I've not been using it much cus of that.",
      "Prices displayed are deceiving/misrepresented of \"actual price\" . For example: when shopping bed frames, when you select the size of bed frame (like a king) then select the color, it will show you the price of the full (but doesn't indicate this anywhere on the screen. I had to call customer service who snottingly advised me of this and offered no apologies). Then when you select the color, on the main screen it will show the \"actual price\".",
      "This app used to work fantastic. Unfortunately after multiple updates it has become nothing more than wasted space on my mobile device. As many other people have mentioned 95% of the time it will not load any searches. Will not allow to scroll photos but only enlarges the initial photo as well. I have had some great experiences with Wayfair but this app has forced me on many occasions in the last few weeks to make my purchases elsewhere. I have deleted/ redownloaded as well as much more.",
      "Not sure what happened to this app but I can no longer view any of the color selections. No matter what option I select the photo doesn't change. Please fix this. Buying online from stock photos is already a gamble but not being to preview a color sample is just bad. I've used this app many times and have had no other issues until recently with this problem.",
      "Very cumbersome and slow to use in all aspects: searching for items, filtering items, accessing orders, viewing the cart, etc. The only thing that happens quickly is placing an order. However, it happens so quickly that you don't get to review items or delivery options."

      "At first,game might seem good,but after a few rounds it got worse and worse!Ads were Poppin up too much,and after a few rounds game isn't that good anymore!If you want,you could buy free trial but it is very expensive!Game says it is offline,but it is really not!Why do they want us to play online?So they can show us ads!Till they don't fix it I'm giving it 2 stars!",
      "It's a really fun game but I hate how every time I finish a stage, I have to watch an ad. I can't even play it offline because being online is a requirement so that the ads are viewable. Its making the game unplayable and irritating to be honest, I hope it wasn't that pushy with watching advertisements. The ads are ruining the game.",
      "This game has way to many adds it makes it unplayable as you get a choice to watch an add to increase your income or just collect however if you press on just collect you are forced to watch an add anyway ( which you are unable to cancel unless you leave the game ) overall I would not recommend anyone to support such greedy behaviour unless they make it actually optional to watch adds for extra in-game profits",
      "It is a good game and all but once I got 41 people when the time was almost up they disappear and it keeps the map view it's weird please fix and easy 5 stars. Edit: it's super awesome not saying don't get also I have to close out to keep playing.",
      "Why do I need internet connection to play, it should work perfectly fine without it, but no, then they can't shove dozens of ads down your throat!"

      "Impossible to navigate to even the most basic of categories. You have to use their dumb categories of \"rustic\" or \"traditional\". You can't just see office chairs. At best, you can see office chairs that are \"New arrivals\". Giving up and using the website.",
      "Updated to 4 stars because they company corrected the app and now it works great. I'm not sure why the previous update broke it up, at least the company listens and corrects things. It's appreciated since I do a lot of online shopping for my customers. Horrible. The app freezes everytime I try and use it. I thought it was a needed update, tried that, still freezes. Then I tried uninstalling and reinstalling just to be sure, freezes as soon as I open it.",
      "It seems like everytime I go to my phone's home page I get a notification from overstock. At times this is a little aggravating.",
      "App is great, but the emails are crazy!!! If you look at one thing, even by accident, you get bombed with emails about it. If you search for an item, you get many emails about it. Too many emails!! The selection of items is great.",
      "App works just fine on my phone. No issues. But not impressed with stunted selection/variety in departments other than decor. Take kids/girls clothing for example. Horrendous. Other than basics, I have a hard time believi anyone is buying those horrible prints, dumb slogans, and ridiculous color options for their kids. Reminds me of my local Marshalls- fairly decent decor but girls clothes consists of 3 pairs of sparkling animal print stretch pants and a pink tshirt with a cat wearing sunglass"

I don't have the option to leave reviews at all on the app. Even when I'm prompted to leave reviews for a contest the link takes to a blank page. Also, the app only lets me enter giveaways every 2 days instead of 24 hrs. Please fix!",

Also, I sometimes find it hard to navigate the app, I can't always find the features I'm looking for (leaving reviews, changing email settings...) Other then that it's a great app and there's no bug so far",

      "It's easy to browse and purchase from this app but rewards are sometimes not processed immediately. Great app!",
      "Good for shopping, not for loyalty. I have happily bought stuff on this app for way over a year, and it is easy to use and find what o want. However, the loyalty aspect is severely lacking in development as whenever I have bought something, I haven't got the points. With some purchases it has been over a month. I feel like this issue should be looked into, especially with how promoted the loyalty is."

This is a major inconvenience for me. Fix that glitch and the app would be perfect.",
      "This app was extremely convenient and easy to use before it updated to the latest version. Now, I can't access my account (but I can access it on the computer) and it's almost impossible to place an order on the app. Still convenient to look at clothes and sales and can track orders as long as you have the order number",
      "It's a good app overall. Only issue I have is that it keeps signing me out every damn time whenever I want to use the app again.",
      "Dont know what's wrong with your app can't make my purchase cart loads go thru loading payment then says pick shipping address. Then repeat payment, ship over and over. So the app is just for looking can't buy anything here."

      "So far, so good. Seems to have interesting items. Read the comments on the item before making your purchase. Item may be not exactly what your looking for. Sizes run a bit smaller. Shipping times and/or pricing, can be a bit tense at times. Especially when you select color and/or other options at the \"Buy\" button. However, with the sales, discounts, and promos, shipping & pricing can be forgiving. It says its a WISH app. Seems a bit more interesting then WISH, maybe cause its new, (to me). 😊",

I can never find what I'm searching for: Samsung Galaxy Tab A 550 9.7 cases but in it gives me anything but what I'm looking for!☹️😡",

They refunded the money immediately. I be mindful, and pay attention...some things are misleading, size, quality and quality... that being said R FAMILY GIVES THIS APP 5 STARS & 10 THUMBS UP!",

      "It's a wonderful app and wonderful site but it's beyond frustrating that whenever you preorder something, you aren't able to pay right then. It's that the whole point of preordering? Pay now, so you can get it when it first comes out? It's not even an option on the app, which has led me to thinking I've bought something already only to be charged months later. Overall a great app but it could have certain aspects executed better.",
      "App is generally really nice, clean interface smooth action, crisp transitions to next product. The reason for 3 stars is, I have a few items I \"save for later\" , everytime I log on there is always a message in my cart about \"new information of a product Your cart\" when I click on this link, well nothing happens. System freezes on a blank screen.",
      "Lately the app has become frustrating 😠. Normally when I've made a purchase, I click the continue shopping button at the bottom of the order confirmation screen. Just recently, Amazon has starting putting small banner adds that are timed to pop up right where the Continue Shopping button is located a split second before I click it. It happens almost right before I click, and I inadvertently click the ad instead. As a result, I'm adjusting my habits to close the app after a purchase instead.",
      "The daily deals/lightning deals/watching deals tab has disappeared. It was available a few days ago but it's not there anymore. I was using the home page to find them but they disappeared from there as well today. Tried doing a Google search and I still can't find them. I've searched through every tab and category in the app and it's still not there. Where have they gone?",
      "This app is clunky, frustrating, and slow. Whether it's between info not displaying correctly, to crashes (on my Pixel 4XL), to just how slow and confusing it is to browse product listings, reviews, and essentially everything you need for a good shopping experience. Many times I just swap to my computer after failing with the app."

If you try to get money back which i paid in full they compensate very small amount or nothing. But still like it because there is some stuff you can't find it in the stores and they cheap. Overall thanks.",
      "Over all i like the app. It could use some work. Tracking of packages leaves a lot to be desired. Also, if there is a way to deal with a lost package, i couldnt find it. Last package was lost for over a week. Lost between county post offuce and home delivery with no way to arrange for replacement other than just ordering, paying, and waiting all over again.",
      "App was good until last month. It is now asking me for a bank statement to prove a previous purchase, every time I open the app. And then it cancels all my orders automatically without reason. I've lost tons of discounts this way. I've written to them several times WITH the proof they wanted. Even wrote to their support team as the developer asked. Been more than a week. ZERO response. Looks like they don't want my money.",
      "It has some good deals but be careful with the way the app works. The prices change from one screen to the next for no apparent reason. You can't talk to a live person. It does some shady things like offer you 5% off if you are ready to check out. BUT, doesn't give you the chance to look over your order fore it instantly checks you out. This is where I have seen the prices change for no reason and by then your order has been placed. AND, to undo that you have to cancel one item at a time. Why?",
      "Like all apps and sites, it has it's downsides. Some of this stuff is the definition of builders grade BS. But for the people with common sense...you get what you pay for. One of the really big draw backs is not having a [ BUY NOW] button. If I'm filling my cart with stuff I want to purchase all at one time next week, but pass something I want to buy now but don't want to empty my cart to do. I should be able to click [BUY NOW] to bypass my cart without emptying it out."

      "The old version is way better than the new version because the old app was simple and easy to follow and you can see everything on the page together. The new version has too much information that you don't need scattered in-between too many pop-ups and if you don't know to keep strolling down you will miss the other items the seller is selling and they loose out. Go back to the last version. This version doesn't make sense.",
      "Great app. The distance setting in the search filter was a little off. Like I tried putting in items up to 30 miles away but it had some stuff in there that was to me like 40-50 miles away. It seemed better when I narrowed it closer to my location though. That's the only issue I've experienced with it. The process to post what you want to sell is NOT overly complicated, it's simple to use, but it's kind odd looking for me though. But that's just my opinion there, everything else seems great.",
      "I've had great success with this app, my only complaint is regarding the ads. I do understand to keep this app 100% you need to show ads but I find them to be repetative, rather intrusive and very large. If you don't know to keep scrolling once you see a large ad then you will miss out on a lot things for sale.",
      "It's a great way to make extra money. It's fun to meet with all the interesting people however there are a few flaws to the game. For instance, it is a turn off when a person promises to purchase and they give a date and time then they never show up! Its It's frustrating, and a waste of time I wish that LETGO could implement some kind of consequence for the people that stand people doing things",
      "This is a platform that works and is built well. However the app still has many bugs. They're mostly annoying, some are a little inconvenient. None of them inhibit use of the platform though. They've got a ways to go, and are founded on solid ground. Personalized recommended searches must be based on nothing, because I get recommendations for electronics but all I search for a bit are clothes. Notifications to my phone duplicate themselves, lag, and are sometimes broken."

You must edit your shipping address in order to choose the two day option for shipping. They offer a military discount, but it can't be used with other promotions. Your competitor allows this. In order to get the code for the military discount, you have to use your desktop and upload documents to SheerID and wait for an email with a single use code.",
      "The app is good. However, there is a glitch when checking out to pay. When i paid at checkout, the app kept giving me an error message and try again. I tried twice and i kept getting the error message. So i decided to check my acoount and appears that 2 two tranactions were made. I had to call and cancel one of the orders. Please fix. At this time, the same item is in checkout like i never bought them. Please adjust the app. Thank you",
      "biggest issue is the slow loading times for pictures, search results and everything else. This app also takes a lot of energy. The positive is they have a good selection in stock. Hundreds of items. They just need to make this app run faster so I can find what I want before I give up from waiting",
      "This app is amazing. I totally think that people should get this app, that is if u are a nike person. Yes shopping in store is a little better I think. But if u dont have a store near you, its perfect. Because you dont have to travel all that way if you are a home person. If you like shopping in store and they dont have the product you need, I guarantee they will have it on this app. If not they will update you when they have the item you want.",

      "I used this app pretty frequently but very recently the app started acting like what the other reviews here are saying.. can't view products.. nothing is loading.. can't see the customer reviews anymore. Need to fix this asap! I want to purchase more items but don't feel comfortable to do so until these problems are fixed. Being able to view customer reviews and comments are the main reason why most of us will purchase something. I've tried reinstalling and signing in and out of my account.",
      "This app is so cool. Unfortunately I've had it saved everything I liked and now it's not showing the reviews, comments or pictures of other people that have ordered the same item. This helped me know how the item looked like in real life. It's been doing it for a year now. I just uninstalled the app and install the app but it's still doing it!!! Please fix this issue. It's sad I haven't ordered nothing and wont until I see the comments and pictures of people that have ordered these items",
      "I use to love the app but I haven't been able to see the stuff I've saved or any reviews on any of the products I've tried looking at also all related items don't load. I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled it twice and still nothing. Ive read some of your replies to do an update but there is no update. So I'm not sure what to do.",
      "I love this app, unfortunately it has been crashing lately, the search engine kicks you out and doesn't let you search for anything. Every few minutes the website kicks you out as well. I read other reviews that have been having the same issues and it says to upgrade the version, however I deleted and re-installed the app and it keeps doing the same thing.",
      "When I can use the app it seems to be pretty decent... I mean it could be... but it kicks me off alot so it's very frustrating. I couldnt tell you what the checkout looks like bc I dont make it that far without getting the boot. I wish I could give it a 0 star rating, honestly a ( - ) star rating would be more fitting. Hopefully you fix the bs!"

Every time I enter payment information nothing happens... wasn't able to submit my order. Tried the whole process again a few more times but with no success. This was gonna be my first time shopping on this app, after a few hours of surfing through I pretty much wasted my time!!! Maybe I'll check back later but as for now you left me no choice but to uninstall :(",
      "Cant use this app due to embedded ads. Get knocked off of website every time i try to scroll through, so im sick of trying to use it. Most ridiculous frustrating thing ive ever seen on a website/app.",
      "I have bought alot from this app !I dont like the shipping Policys pay to ship + return ? Shipping should be free returns damaged refund policy blocking pics beware return shipping not $8.95 I payed $17.95 on two packages then then they blocked me from sending them Gmail's about overcharge blocked free shipping on mutli orders till 11:59 changed time ordered ? Block Gmail's calls are just as bad saying I didn't call soon enough I contact on delivery ! Make sure items + size are correct !",
      "Just continuously says, \"we've hit a small snag.\" Used to be a great app ... Not sure what the new update did but it screwed everything up.",
      "The app was very user friendly until the new update. It's impossible to browse, now you just have to scroll through hundreds of items. Loved the way it use to be. Edit: just downloaded the new update and it is still impossible to navigate the app. Please put the search options back the way it was last year where you could search by groups, not where hundreds of items are together. It's too time consuming and impossible to navigate. I get so frustrated with the search options I give up!"

      "Great app, been using since 2012-ish, and they have made major & minor tweaks along the way, but most recently I've found it difficult to physically create new listings, even with the help of Posh tech support; they definitely raised shipping prices, you can't make an offer to likers without also choosing to pay 1 of 2 shipping costs, so you can't make offer on items +/=$6 or it results in negative payment; & lastly, charging buyers tax on items I'd already paid taxes on in the past. Double dip.",
      "I love this app. Genius!!! Everyone on this site seem to be a higher caliber than other sites. My questions about items are always promptly answered, the items are in great shape. The coolest thing is being able to find things from your past (example: Vision streetwear clothing). or discontinued colors for fav make up items. Literally bought my wedding dress on poshmark. Awesome site. Great app!",
      "I love this app. But unfortunately I messed up and I inadvertently deleted it by mistake when trying to delete an unused app. I realized what I did, and reloaded the app. Now I lost my likes in my profile area even though other things are kept and the teck is screwing with me. It won' let me do anything. I can't comment, ask questions or reach out to anyone. I have a credit with Posh, and everything. Help I'm having major problems, and I wanted to buy something too? Now what do I do?",
      "Need better sales reports to include transfers. App has been sharing extremely slower than normal lately. For days, if not weeks now! Can you please add a sort feature for shared last and oldest listings? It would help when there are these issues with sharing. Would make sharing and updating older inventory a whole lot easier and less daunting for larger closets when you have to scroll all the way to bottom over and over. Also, adding photos all at once would be nice as in other apps. Thanks!",
      "App works perfectly for buying and selling, no issues there. However, when asked to go through reported items & review them, after I make and select a decision, and it moves on to the next reported item, the app still shows the previous reported item and its info, but the bottom part changes. The only way to get to the next reported item is to back completely out back to notifications screen, otherwise it will continue to only show that first reported item."

      "Needs work. I'm giving the eBay app three stars because basically it does what it should, although it does need quite a bit more tweaking to function better. Unfortunately the issues that I have experienced relate to the everyday functionality of it. It is very glitchy and does need seemingly constant babysitting to ensure that it is doing everything you want it to and that it is not just deciding to do certain things for you. Use with caution.",
      "I downloaded to buy a few things that I saw. I am ultimately unimpressed. Whereas I was excited to buy things from people (who accept my card type) and such, but 90% checking out I would get an alert saying \"could not process payment, change card or try pay pal\". Sometimes it would process the payment, but only one or two items instead of all 10. I just don't understand, the buyers accept my card type, I have the money, I just don't have the patience for all of this. Please fix this",
      "I just installed the last update and it did nothing to correct the small text! I can barely read my messages and the entire app text is very small!!! Still sucks!!! I also don't like the new tracking screen! I used to be able to click on the tracing number and it would take me to the carriers website and with a simple click I could receive shipping updates on my orders! You people screwed that up too! Please put that back the way it was! REMEMBER FOLKS: \"IF IT ISN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!!!\"",
      "The messaging system is glitchy! I can't communicate with sellers as the send arrow only appears about 1/4 the time. It also has trouble loading the messages received so I can read them. Sometimes I have to click back out of the message and then back into it a few times before it decides to load.",
      "Not any better than the previous one, jumping all over the place when doing searches, you request to search by lowest price first and it still hides them between the higher priced items, so taking ages and time consuming to find things I want at affordable prices. I also hate the assumption in every search that there are things I do not want to see in each subject, I want to see all items available not have only the ones chosen by someone else who knows nothing about what I may be looking for?"

      "When switching away from your app and returning to it, it reverts back to the main screen, which is incredibly frustrating. Also when sharing to other apps, like wishlist apps, it doesn't pass the name of the item or any images to it. Try having your app developers share an item to the Wish Explorer app and you'll see what I mean. Your app needs to \"play nice\" with other Android apps, like the Amazon app does, in order to impress me and earn a higher rating or better review.",
      "Wonky! Won't add your Nordstrom Notes, or at least let you see/view them to add the information in. Does not have a stand-by online help operator to guide you through if you're having issues/questions with the website. Having to arrow back a million times to get to your shopping cart and wishlist - those should be visible on every page! Overlapping of products if you arrow back on some pages.",
      "Just awful interface when you actially go to checkout. Items will disappear, samples will be in your cart one minute and then gone the next. Had to re-enter my shipping address even though it's already saved in my address book. Shipping option was stuck on express shipping and wouldn't let me click on free standard. Overall this was a horrible experience and it made me give up on making an order all together!",
      "Difficult to send things to various addresses for gifts. You have to be certain to double and triple check that your item doesn't go to the last address used. I've had three items get sent to the wrong place. They try in customer service to correct it when you use the chat feature, but the ap launches the order directly to the vendor, and if you do not get the address correctly the first time, which is difficult to do, because there is no review toggle, you're doomed.",
      "Easy to use and purchase from app. I wish it had a better filter and sort option like the website does. Also, viewing items ordered from your account inconvienently switches between app and web browser not a very seamless experience."

I told her that I have an Android phone, and she said maybe that's why since she uses an iPhone...So I'll just go online through my Computer instead.",
      "The app is good overall but the Wishlist won't show anything I've added to it and when I try to add something to the list, and heart gets filled and then unfilled. It also shows items that cannot be placed in my cart.",
      "I had it before and it worked really well. But now I'm trying to sign in and it keeps saying to \"try again\" IVE DONE IT 6 TIMES! resetting my password and my email. Even tried to make a new account dosn't work. So if you can PLEASE fix that it would be greatly appreciated."

      "Love this app. Shopping and selling items are easy. Only negative I've experienced is that They are overly aggressive on monitoring every aspect of communication between the seller and buyer, so just keep that in mind. Also when you first start off selling, be aware that you must figure out your exact shipping costs before you price an item. I offered to sell a baby doll bed for $10 and was told by USPS that it would cost $99 to ship to the other side of country due to the dimensions of the box.",
      "I really like Mercari for selling stuff! It's easy to use. I've sold two things so far, but my issue is that my listings dont show up when I go to my profile and click the Selling tab on the app... It's annoying because I get the \"Action Required\" notification but it takes me to a page where it says I have no listing and no in-progress sales. I have to go on my computer to look at my listings. I really hope this gets fixed.",
      "Love this app. I have a lot of makeup and clothes I'm not going to use so this app is awesome for selling those kind of things and everything really! I've sold all sorts of items. Never had an issue with receiving my funds. In my experience mercari has been great with handling any issues I've had as a buyer and seller. Love the changes they've made to the app but there still are some things that could improve.",
      "3/21/20 Update: The app, on any device, will not load my messages and this has been going on for almost 2 months. I've been using the app for 3 years now, and it is kind of ridiculous that my messages won't load on any device. I am an IT specialist, and have gone through every known protocol. Have reinstalled numerous times, reset and tried diff connections (data/wifi/etc), and reset device settings. Seems as of you are intentionally disallowing my messages to be opened. Please resolve this.",
      "Great as a buyer, ok as a seller. Mercari tries to get you to price things as low as possible. They also automatically have a feature turned on that lowers the price with views. So your item will Bottom out fast. So as a buyer you are getting awesome deals but it's not as great as a seller. Also the $2 fee to cash out is a bit ridiculous in this day and age. I already paid a fee on what I was paid for the item and now I have to pay again to have MY money."

      "So far, so good! The app runs fine on my S9. I had no difficulty in checking out. I didn't read instructions on choosing my gift. I tapped on the product picture (not the \"claim\" button, and it went to my cart. I was expecting details on a discreet little massager. I removed it from my cart and went looking, but didn't ever see the welcome gifts again. Otherwise, my first shopping experience with C👄ute, was splendid! I'll be back!"

      "It's very hard to quickly find what you're looking for much of the time, sometime its very easy! Be careful how you write an items description, it can make all the difference. Dont have a problem with an item - THE HELP FROM DHGate IS TERRIBLE!! Never ordered an item that didn't turn up, so all good. The quality of garments that have arrived is brilliant",
      "I'd give it 5 stars but the app is glitchy. Its frustrating when you find something interesting and then the screen goes blank and jumps back to the previous or home page. If that's the bug that was suppose to be fix, it's not fixed. Please fix this and earn 5 stars. Update 1/22/2020..app is worse. Dhgate is great but the app is frustrating. UPDATE 2/18/2020 App is fixed and running smooth. I'm a happy shopper!",
      "Overall, this app is great. I really like the ability to search for \"similar\" items. Communication is excellent. I always know the status of my orders. There is one thing that drives me nuts. The app hoses-up on my android smart phone as I try to leave a review of any purchase. Not one review entry has been successful using my phone. This never happens when I use my desktop pc.",
      "If the app did not crash every few minutes ot would great. And the search engine could be better. But other than that it is pretty good. It would also be nice if the mainpage would show in your default currency. Mine shows U.S. until I place it in my in basket. Okay resolved the currency issue but now it keeps giving me an error about a newer version 4.9.9. So where is this version? Please fix your software. Just updated to 5.0.2... things seem much better. The app has not crashed on me yet.",
      "It's a decent app. It finally stopped crashing all the time, but it still has a couple issues. You really can't track your orders & when you try it's either in Chinese or it just says it's been processed and shipped, nothing further than that. I've tried using the tracking number they provide & have never been able to get them to work either. Also they keep sending me notifications and I click on them to try to answer the question they're asking and it doesn't give you an option. Aggravating😡!!"

      "Thank you so much for the update. That seems to fix my check out issue. However, customer service over the phone was a whole different ball game. They gave me the unlimited run around, transferring me to all different \"department\". I was extremely disappointed in best buy customer service. I didnt expect that. That was my last time i will ever call period.",

      "Why in the WORLD do I have to enter my card number, account info, security questions, and then change my password EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I try to log in to pay my credit card. Its absolutely ridiculous. I can see others are having this issue and nothing is being done. Frustrating.",

      "You know what would be great? If the app stopped logging me out every 3 days. You know what else would be fantastic? If I could get rid of coupons that I KNOW FOR A FACT that I don't need. You make it easy to clip stuff that I don't even want. Now make it easy to delete it. And why does this app even NEED a password??? Because someone may steal my coupons??? Oh nooooo. Now you're just acting like over glorified CVS or Rite Aid or somewhere that actually has full shelves.",
      "App worked great until my phone broke.. I had to reinstall on another phone.. Don't EVER forget your password. It's impossible to do a password reset I have a bunch of saved coupons and spins.. Family Dollar won't let me reset my password. The link in the password reset email just goes to the main page. The \"contact us\" link on the password reset email is a broken link as well. I tried calling the 800 number but apparently the line is only open \"bankers hours\". Closed before I leave for work . Already closed when I come home from work. Not open on weekends either. When I do take time off to call, I can't get a hold of a real person.. Just a voicemail system with a mountain of options, but no option of \"app help\". I left messages but no response. I spend a lot of money at Family Dollar since they are the only store within 15 miles from me. If I can't get coupons, I'll just buy my stuff from Amazon..",
      "What a POS. I just tried to sign up and it has so many bugs just trying to key in a password that I'm am deleting it already. No sooner did I try to log in, it told me to change my password. When I sent for the code, it auto filled the code then sent me to the page to key in the new password....only there was no space to create one. I tried 3 times and it just sits there waiting for me to key something in with no space to do so. I'm beyond frustrated.",
      "The app is horrible and almost as crappy as the products they carry. Don't bother downloading this app. Nobody at the stores know anything about it or why it doesn't work. You will spend your time clipping coupons only to find out at the cash register that you didn't fulfill the requirements that were buried 3 screens deep when you clipped it. A HUGE WASTE OF TIME.",
      "Its ok, but only if ur looking for specific items. Wouldnt let me use the 'list' function on the app, the scanner wasnt that great either!"

It was okay for a while now it harder to pay it through cause u see things you wanna get and have to pay on it again and again till the payment is throught.

      "I've used Chewy for years now and I've never had a bad experience. I use Chewy for food, prescriptions, toys, treats, literally everything for my cats and dogs. I've had to call or email a few times with questions and they were always helpful and nice. Every year they send birthday and holiday cards. They even mailed me a portrait of my dog! I love them so much.",
      "I love how easy this is to use. Also the amount you have to spend to get free shipping is very easy to hit. The auto ship is another great feature and the fact that you can postpone a shipment or request it sooner makes it very easy to use and adjust to your and your pets schedule.",
      "The app is just as good as the company absolutely amazing, the app is very easy to use and navigate me and my dad never had any issues aside from one time two damaged products came in and the issue was resolved as fast as reported and we were given free replacements I highly suggest this app to any pet owner as it's faster, cheaper and easier then driving out to the stores to search for one specific product along with discovering new ones all in all 10/10 do recommend <3",
      "I love this app so much! It's so easy for me to order things for my fubabies especially since I'm always at work. Not only do they offer 2 day shipping they have great customers service! They wrote to my dog daisy a handwritten letter before her passing. Amazing app, and amazing customer care! 10/10 would recommend!",
      "I have always loved the convenience of Chewy, now more than ever. I got all my shopping done, and didn't have to endure the corona-craziness. I would like to see more coupons in general from the site, you get lured in with the 30% off and then you're lucky if you get 10% off after. I dont want to spend $50 to get free shipping every time so a better percentage off would absolutely encourage me to shop with Chewy more than three times a year (my average # of orders right now)."

      "Great app. Great concept. Just wish there was a search option without having to buy something first so I don't have to wade through things I have no interest in.",
      "I love this app, and I understand the point is to outbid people, but I find it hard to take items from other's. I have found that if you set reminders the app will let you know when you can bid again. If you miss the bidding opportunity, they usually offer you the item at a base amount. That amount is usually less than what you would have bid, so for that reason if something is going twice I try not to take items from other's. My time always comes around. Common courtesy goes a long way. JS",
      "Fun and exciting app, unfortunately most everything (ALL) comes from CHINA. I found even if it says USA it ships from overseas 😥. I also found the app locks till you pay for item won so you can't bid on anything else. App is slow to show details of item, also what you see in the picture is not always what you get so read the details first. Clothes are Chinese sizes so if your a size 16 /18 Us that's a 5x large or xxxxxL becareful on this site.",
      "Fun (free to bid) Pay if you win Auction Site. New stuff daily. Auctions start every 90 seconds. all kinds of items from electronics, jewelry, home and hobby, premium, fashion and beauty. Lots of surprise items. You won't be sorry you checked it out. UPDATE 2/26/20 it's a 50/50 chance of getting exactly what was pictured, described, and expected. Most items are on eBay. All items have multiples. While fun, 90 sec is not enough time to read full desc & bid. Buy it now $ are 2 High. C eBay",
      "I am so, so, waaaaaay to app!!!!! Sometimes you have to wait a bit for the shipping time cuz a lot of stuff comes from. I have bought about 12 rings or so and a tennis bracelet as well and they are all so gorgeous!! I have told my family and all my friends about this app and to use it because you really can get great deals from here. They are easy to refund your money if you are not satisfied or change your mind. so be careful when you download and start bidding cuz you will get addicted quick"

I scroll to the bottom of the checkout page, the minute I stop it takes me right back to the top. So stupid. Whatever I'll find a different better site, the item is the same price no matter where I get it. Was trying to give a smaller store my money, guess not.",

      "The app makes you log in everytime you go on. And the interface is basically no different than the website. No sale notifcations. Its not any more convenient than the Tillys website. Pointless app.",
      "I dunno, man. You would think they would spend the money to have a more seamless app. Why do I have to sign back in *every* time I open it? The menus are super clunky and almost all of the pictures of items don't let you zoom in to see a design up close. Tilly's... hire some better designers.",
      "glitchy. never put the items in the cart that I picked out the first time. and when I finally had the right items I wanted in the cart and proceeded to checkout, it didnt accept my purchase and continued to malfunction. I've been trying to order these 5 things for a whole week with no progress. please, fix this app."

Thankyou very much",
      "Makes shopping on ur phone a lot easier and faster. Also you can get points which = $$$ by checking in on app. Reviews of products are helpful. Mostly shein brand that I've noticed but also cheaper than what's on the shein app. Can't get much cheaper than this. They ship straight from China and usually really fast.",
      "Just wish they had new choices it seems like i see the same thing every time i go on the app. The clothes are starting to look more old lady like. Wish they had more of a younger feel not all people like the 80's and 90's look.",
      "I love the clothes, lots of options and styles. Although last week I ordered clothing and it has said processing ever since. My worry starting growing bigger, but im still having hope that it will come soon because my friends had recommended me this app. Additional, they took off two of the clothing that I had ordered because they don't have them in stockwhen they said they did and they said that they refunded but I didn't see it on my card. I hope this app doesn't disappoint me.",
      "I love how many varieties of items that are in stock; it really feels like a vortex of great things. When putting in account the prices of stores now a days, this app has great clothes ,and they're super affordable"

Fop wouldn't store until the 4th time, signing in with Amazon as an option was problematic. I did eventually get things done but it was frustrating to say the least.",
      "I bought me a couple pair pants on this app. I thought this app is easy to use, but I wish they had more clothing brand name. Such as Echo, Polo, and etc. When I was creating/signing up for an account, it will give you an option to ether use your Amazon account. As your login for your Zappos account little FYI. I didn't go that route, I usually like to keep all my accounts separate. Even though it would have been faster",
      "I have not had an easy time with this app. Maybe it's an age thing (this geezer has a struggle with some tech stuff), but it just seems hard to control. Things happen and I don't understand why, and I end up at the beginning screen and have to start over again. Sigh. I think I'll go back to using the website.",
      "I think the app is very excellent but could be amazing if the brand name alphabetical list was on here like it is on the desktop version. I do like to check out other brands I'm unfamiliar with especially those that cater to men clothing.",
      "Can't check out cause it won't let me put in my shipping address. Also can't print return label because it downloads on my phone as a .gif. Why? There's just too many steps to take to make this app or a return to work. No thanks"

BTW, this happens during both data AND wifi usage, and I've checked my phone. Since etsy maskes it so freaking difficult to contact them, and I already have a REAL life, removing this app from my phone will be a good thing!",

      "Local Deals- Pros: 1. Makes enjoying life a lot easier & cheaper. 2. Can rebuy, extend, or exchange. Cons: 1. Very specific rules. 2. Not always available per deal. Product Deals- Pros: 1. Much cheaper than regular prices on most items. 2. Current on fads/trends. 3. Can keep items in cart for desired time frame. Cons: 1. Some require many extra steps being time consuming & confusing. 2. Shipping takes FOREVER! 3. Stock usually low or sold out. SITE- HORRIBLE Customer service",
      "Definitely worth to save money on things you'd like to do. Especially sales for going out to eat or entertainment. Also, some sales are insanely good. A local MMA gym had a month's worth of class for $13... Most gyms cost $300. This app is also good if you want to try new things, but are reluctant to spend a huge amount on something you may not like.",
      "I really enjoy using groupon but trying to talk to someone about an issue is nearly impossible, to chat with a person is very disappointing, I feel as I am being rushed and nothing get accomplished, this is very frustrating. I accidentally purchased 2 of the same deal and was trying to let someone know about the issue and was told it was refunded but I do not see where it has been and now trying to find out more info on the situation has become very stressful",
      "Been using for years with mostly good experiences. Bought a few deals before coronavirus and customer service helped me to get groupon bucks so the deals wouldnt go to waste during the outbreak. Customer service very accommodating. I only wish more places would offer a groupon, seems to be the same few local places for months and months.",
      "Its a good app, has some bargains but could do with combining some postage charges. Have had to return a couple of clothes items but groupon sort problems out almost on the spot and i've bought lots of goods with no problems at all. All in all, great!"

In the beginning the only choice was to add to list but when I was finished there was no list and nothing in my cart so I had to keep looking around until I was finally in the section to add to my cart then had to redo all my items. Very confusing app. I wouldn't be using if we weren't staying in since we are older and told to stay home.",
      "3/20/20 Unable to start shop and scan. Last update was 3/18/20. How long does it take to fix the issue? If you can't fix it, why not go to the previous version that was working? Why not at least place a pop-up message in the shop and scan screen that the issue is known and is being taken care of. Would save a lot of time and frustration to your customers.",
      "I have loved this app in the past, it had made shopping so easy. Unfortunately, I and many others have complained that the shop and scan feature isn't working. I don't see any helpful responses from the app builders on how to fix the issues, just more people, like myself, posting our frustration and asking for the app to be fixed. PLEASE, fix the issues as soon as possible.",
      "App not working properly. I tried signing in and out several times, turning my phone off and back on but neither worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app but haven't had the opportunity to try using it again. Now for some reason I'm unable to move the app icon to my phone's home screen. Frustrating.",
      "Love this app. Allows me to see all the ads. Keeps track of the favorite items I purchase regularly. Also keeps track of what I spend. Best of all allows me to clip coupons from a big selection. Saves me lots of money plus gives me rewards for purchasing a certain amount . If you shop meijers, this app is a must have."

      "This app is wonderful! The only thing that would make it better (why I gave only 4 stars) is they only show the front and back pictures of wallets. I want to see that, as well as the inside! I like a certain type but never know what the inside looks like. Other than that its amazing. Everything is priced reasonably and comes pretty fast! Thank you!",
      "It was a bit difficult getting around the site. A lot of the clothes are similar. It can be a bit difficult to see the details of the clothing despite the ability to zoom in. I think it is because the clothes just hang there. Not having models saves money I guess. I still need to search other categories. I intend to donate some clothes. But I prefer to donate closer to home usually. I really like the premise of this site though.",
      "Love this app! It's essential a designer Goodwill that I can browse on my phone. I give it a 4 because the filtering abilities are wanting. If you put multiple search criteria, for example color \"gray\" and size \"10,\" it will bring up all items tagged with either of those, not items tagged with both of those. Beyond that relatively small inconvenience it is a great app that aids in reducing textile waste. Would recommend.",
      "Almost a perfect thrift store app. I have made many purchases and unfortunately not all my purchases have been what the photo described. I believe this can easily be fixed if the company took more than two photos of each item at different angles. Photos never capture the inside of items (bags, purses, or wallets) or to the side (leggings or dresses will have a side design, however it's never visible). Other than that I absolutely love this app!",
      "I love this app for buying clothes - thrifting is the only way I buy now. There are tons of high quality items and it's easy to find exactly what I'm looking for every time. It's not great for selling, however, as I received only 33¢ for selling about 3 tops. I know, it's more than I would get for donating, but still, 33¢! While they are transparent about payout prices, the fact that the payout amounts are miniscule and de-incentivise selling through this app remains."

Did and same thing. Please fix the app. Edit. The app now is working for me. I was very frustrated but after many uninstalls things are better now. I'll still use GOAT.",
      "They need to fix this new app, uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't fix the problems. I have reached out to someone at the Goat team and received an email asking me to screenshot the purchase problem, did so and received nothing as to actually working to FIX the problem. Was just told, they knew of this problem and are working to fix it. If I can't purchase an item how am I to receive it, when your app isn't fixing the \"purchasing\" problem??? PLEASE ACTUALLY FIX THIS, PLEASE AND THANK YOU!!! 😤",
      "There's something wrong with the site/app. The app doesn't allow you to log in, the website doesn't allow you to view your account. There is no option to look at your purchases, etc. I ordered some kicks not knowing this and after I emailed them, they responded telling me to uninstall/reinstall....of course I did that before emailing you guys! Come on...",
      "My 1st time using Goat. Didn't know that, when you made offers on merch, you aren't notified to continue or confirm that you are willing to go through with the purchase after the seller accepts. THAT IS NEEDED IN THIS APP! You just get your bank account hit without confirmation and could be out of 100s or 1000s of dollars. Cool app nonetheless",
      "If everyone dont see what is going on is insane. They used to be a good company and the last few months has been flooded with negative reviews and the app update not working was intentional. You cant track orders or use your online credit. Ive seen this before and I hate to say it but your money and or shoes are gone. Keep an eye out, they will be filing bankruptcy soon. NEW COMERS, STAY CLEAR OF THIS APP AND SITE, IT HAS BECOME A SCAM."

The only suggestion I have is that when you favorite something and it's not available anymore for it NOT to be taken off your Favorites List so that way you can at least find something that looks similar to it.",

      "Useful and fairly intuitive. Would be nice if it auto-deleted Expired clipped items (you can delete it manually) or gave you the option to configure it to do so. Some flyers are more well-suited than others -- from the big chains, generally relatively easy to clip and see. For some places though where the flyers are broad-sheet sized, products shown are miniscule -- so it's hard to see a product, let alone clip it. Not sure if there's anything Flipp can do about that. Zooming in is really painful and not really worth the time.",
      "This app is exceptional!!! I love love love this app you can't go wrong by downloading this app you'll have the sales ads at the tip of your fingers on your phone all day every day! I'm in love with the 'LIST' section you add what you need to buy and the app will pull up all the sales at all the nearby stores in your area! DON'T DELAY DOWNLOAD TODAY!!!",
      "This is a really great app. Super convenient. I love being able to put my loyalty cards in it too, but am holding back one star because there isn't a way to add a card unless the store is already in their loyalty list. So I have cards from smaller retailers that I have to still carry.",
      "While scrolling through the flyers, tapping on certain items, the page would not display clearly. A different display of another item would appear. When I try to correct the problem, the entire page would be unclear. Basically it would show a collage of ads. I prefer looking through the (old fashioned) paper flyer.",
      "Aside from the convenience of every flyer at your fingertips, I absolutely love the search feature. If I have to buy an item on a tight budget any given week, it's great knowing that I can compare all the local ads for it and buy where its the best price!"

      "Can't scan products. I have downloaded the app three times on two different phones and still the scan function for barcodes will not work. The purpose of me having the app is to check the prices on sale and clearance items before I purchase them, but I can't get it to work. In my opinion, the app has been horrible and a waste of time.",
      "3/10/20. Well i didn't have to add a card to use. But i think it need to speed up as when after a scan it takes to long to load a price especially since you are forcing customers to use instore wifi, by blocking cell signal inside your stores. Auto location for the store you are in would make it better. Still has room for improvement.",
      "The scan an item option is frustrating. It needs to be separated from the search window. It would be helpful to be able to save several stores to toggle between on the 'my store.' Many DG shoppers frequent multiple stores."

Like its blank. No options to reload page or whatever. Idk if its a singular issue or if others are having this sort of problem.",
      "I love the apps just don't understand why they would take away the Love List! Now if I find something I love but don't want to purchase with my current transaction I have to completely take it out of my cart and try to relocate the item again after I have made my purchase so that I don't lose track of it. How on Earth are you supposed to keep track of the items thought you loved if there is no place to store your favorites? I can deal with every glitch or app issue but that one so that would be my highest recommended problem to address with this app. With this being a billion dollar clothing\\lingerie industry with both of their apps being out for years now I don't understand why they haven't been updated with a list for you to store your favorite items just like the website. I'm kinda shocked at that issue.. 🤔",

      "The past few days since last update the ads crash or jus dont respond when you click watch ad for extras on the game so its hard to get any further than where i am unless i wait for long periods of time & the loading screen freezes for a bit causing it to take longer than it usually would take to load. Love this game & play it daily especially with the franchise piece i do be hooked, would love if it was a permenant part of the game at times but it keeps the game a little more exciting.",
      "It offers you to watch an ad for more customers or faster Cashiers but everytime I click on it... It does not play it it only let's you watch like 3 ads a day but yet it keeps giving you the option to watch them but than says no ads or they just don't play and it goes back to the game. Can't get very far in the game without the ads to help.",
      "Going to change the city and I just thought that it would change the background but it actually restarted my whole entire thing and I hated that ,you guys should really update that make it just have a different background and more money with the truck or something like that. And I was trying to go back to the one that already on but it looks like it got sold for some unknown reason you guys should let people go back to their first town",
      "I absolutely loved this game for a while, but then when I bought a new franchise, I lost EVERYTHING that I had earned at my first one. If you play this game, don't expand to the small city... its dumb and will make you start over",
      "This game is great wish there was a remove adds option to progress a little bit faster and to reduce the number of modifiers that pop up for add if it implemented this goes for all your games. Def should look into it."

      "Update has been a mixed bag. Though the scanner is noticeably faster with the update, the scanner placement has to be just right the first time or else I have to re-scan. Also, the \"almost done\" text notification pops up but does not connect to my messaging app. I have also experienced app freezing, particularly during order processing. In fact, overall order processing time in the app could be improved. On a positive note, I am no longer having to re-take receipt pictures with the update.",
      "Since the most recent update, I cannot even open the app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail. I continue to get prompts for promo orders though. However, as the pay rate has continued to diminish, it may just be time for me and Shipt to part ways. Not worth the two hours of driving, shopping, and delivering for $11.",
      "Needs improvement. Needs to be easier to substitute items or force add something when the barcode wont scan. Needs to show the price for items as this can help you find the right thing. Needs isle numbers for some stores as the categories system can out two things in the same categories even if they are on different sides of the store. No pay for mileage so you can only accept the limited number of orders nearby. The worst part is support takes 15-30min to get and help. Even on an active order.",
      "They just launched a new version of the application, and with everything digital you have to wonder what they were thinking? Who did they ask for information? Big change, let's give it more color and make it harder on humans eyes. I can't wait to lose more of my eyesight! Why do I have to see my profile picture? The font is smaller! When you created this did you use it as a practical application, or did you think , we want it to look cool! Getting an alert at 50 mph with 60 seconds to claim!",
      "So far the new app updates are working great for me. EXCEPT the issue that I cannot access my delivery history prior to December 2019. Hoping my communications with HQ will get this resolved quickly as it is a necessary tool I use to reconcile for tax prep. I am not the only Shopper with this issue."

      "Taking advantage of Coronavirus to make money by featuring upcharged health products. The virus toll counter is also updated slowly, as there have been way more confirmed cases than it says. I used to like this app, but I never thought it would get this scummy.",
      "Ive always enjoyed this app but i dont think they push the sale of local items that much i think they are more concered with the auctions and the Dash section. Ive bought 2 items with both arriving broken and yes they refunded my money but wouldnt send another one to replace it nor any compensation for the trouble it caused me both times. It makes me think i shouldnt buy from dash anymore you cant contact the seller individually. I do like the point system though so 5 stars it is for now",
      "App has changed so much, it's just not the same. Pitiful views, no boost option except with coin rewards which are just a waste of time to complete, and why is this app using over 1G of my storage space? That's un heard of. The Dash feature needs to be monitored unless this is no longer a family friendly app, I mean items range from crotchless lingerie to bondage looking items and barely nude models showcasing these? Seriously guys, not family friendly at all",
      "find anything you need on this app at awesome prices!!! EDITED: I live in the United States but for some reason when I try to share the link to friends or share the app for them to download, it says \"sorry this is not available in your country\" ??? So exactly what countries actually get the rewards for sharing the app with their friends? I will change my review back to 5 stars when I get a good reason for this. Other than is issue, I have loved the app so please let me know why.",
      "Better than other apps, but still needs work. I miss the shipping feature since it helped me get some cool stuff not usually found local. That should still be up to the seller though. The coins feel gimmicky, and kinda more annoying than fun. Still need to not be able to rate literally anyone you have a conversation with ( black mirror anyone?) And as for \"removing inappropriate ratings\", still have it on there after 4 yrs, but removed their's."

      "I used to love this app but, for the past couple months it hasn't been great at all. It crashes, it updates the quanity of items in the cart by itself and thats if the items actually make it to the cart. Almost everytime I try to add an item it says it was added I go to the cart and its empty. We just bought a new house and have spent thousands here but, I'm seriously thinking we may start shopping Home Depot for the rest of what we are going to need. Total inconvience to spend money.",
      "I also have been experiencing the quantity of items in my cart impractical numbers. I wad reading of several other people having the same issue. Mine has been doing that for as very long time and I've just gotten used to it but it's not right. Call me crazy, but I swear at one we could scan store receipts into the app to keep record of what we purchased. I cannot find a way to do that anymore unfortunately... I'd love to see that feature.",
      "It's nice to have when you need it, but I really hate this app. It will show me items that are discontinued. It will also make you add an item to your cart just to see the price. I would rather spend my money at other box stores for the simple fact that they don't make me jump through hoops just a figure out the price of a tub faucet I'm interested in.",
      "Gotten better, but still some of the searches go into left field.",
      "App works well to search for items, but when I place something in my cart for a future purchase, the quantity changes periodically when I go back in. For example, I had put TWO wifi wall plates in the cart. Later, the quantity had changes to 2,999. Same thing with the wifi sockets - 4 changed into 49. I've had it change quantities on nearly everything input in the cart Fix it and I'll update my review!"

      "So the app is great except for one thing. When you want to remove items from your list you should do it one by one, and if it's no longer available it will go to the end of list. When removed it shows the list from top. An update for removing multiple items at once would be great. will give 5 stars if its fixed.👌🏻",
      "Meh. Not much to this app. Searching is clunky, navigation isn't really very efficient. The worst part of the app is the search function, if you look up the \"web ID\" from the catalogs they send through the mail, you get no results most of the time. For example, a catalog \"The Edit Spring 2020\", had many items couldn't be found by web ID. One page, showing a man in a blazer and pants, had instructions to snap a photo of the page for more info and a junior's skirt came up as the search result.",
      "This is the best app ever! So convenient! Your card is saved to your app. You can pay from your app or set up auto pay. You can keep track of your star rewards. You have a list with pictures of your last 6 months of orders with pictures and breakdown of prices with tax. You can keep a list of items ypu want later and you can shop from your app. Your bag is on the app too!",
      "I've had to force close when I'm in the middle of something. When I first installed it had alot of problems with verifying until one day decided to visit the website which allowed me to go ahead with verification. It is very convenient when your shopping in store and some items don't have prices on them or they've been reduced further. You can order online to get shipped to ur house or department store. You can even purchase item while in-store using app and you can use their coupons.",

      "I tend to take a long time when searching items i want to buy, but this app is too slow and too heavy. Not even 5 minute browsing then the app start to not respond anymore so i have to repeatedly close the app for it to be normal again. I miss the old app, it's much lighter than the newer one. Maybe because you guys put so much display on the front page and making it like a more of social media than it is an online marketplace.",
      "Nice application, one of the best shopping app I have ever downloaded. They have almost everything you can think of. I can get stuff with cheaper price without even going to the mall. They also have a lot of promotions such as cashback and free delivery. It is very easy to use, secured and the sellers are very kind. Always satisfied with this app.",
      "Just updated my device to android 10, and the apps lagging everywhere, flash sale, search for product especially, quite annoying when searching a product see the description page then go back, i think already pressed the back button but the page still, press back button again voila, i'm at home page, so i've to start all over again the searching. Now i've faced different problem, when opening store page click categories, page is blank, not showing any product. Please fix it, thank u.",
      "It is very convenient to shop online on shopee but please develop the app and fix the crash or lag when tapping the back button while seeing the products, it is very slow and doesn't respons really well. the app program sometimes doesn't run smoothly, got freeze and suddenly got back to the home screen. This problem happened quite often. Please add option to edit the shopper username. Thank You.",
      "seriously shopee? lagging everywhere when I open the app even I already installed the new version and my connection is good. I think it because too much banner on the app, don't put everything on the app, please fix that thing asap... ps. don't make me to install a new version cause the problem isn't that thing, the problem is because you put everything on it."

Yes it does have a link where you can go and log in, but whenever I see something I like the app makes it look like it's a whole different account. And when I go to the webpage the things I liked in the app are not on the webpage wishlist. In other words, would like the app to be intertwined with my webpage account.",

Bought a couple things off of their app, thinking it was the actual price it said it was, and got screwed when i got charged and extra $20 because I can't convert the currency to Canadian on the app, only converts to USA, UK or Ireland. If i knew that before i purchased anything from your website/app i would have done it online so it shows the real price. Why is not an option?Never know",

      "I signed up for a Klarna account to spread the cost of an in-store purchase. All very convenient and easy to do. So far so good... Then downloaded the app... Oh Dear! Hopelessly clunky. Impossible to see a list of stores you can shop in without endless scrolling down. The search function is useless. Everything I tried was 'not found'. In summary; a great innovation let down by poor implementation in the app. Please, PLEASE provide an alphabetical list of stores and a summary of what they sell.",
      "I wish I could leave an accurate review of this app as a whole but it won't even let me create an account! No errors, no connection issues. The email come through, I click the link, it \"logs me in\" and... I'm back at the create an account/log in screen. I've tried this more than once with the same results. Edit: I've always gotten the emails just fine it won't let me log in after. It just keeps taking me back to the log in screen after I click the link, which I stated before....",
      "I have no problem when it comes to 50 buck purchases, however, I made my first purchase of 80 Thursday evening and it creates three different ghost cards without my knowledge. Of course it taking out 20 still, but it's so sporadic and unorganized, so when I see the notification 'you made a 39.07 payment to Klarna!' I freak out and think I gave you guys access to my bank account. I think after I finish paying off my purchases, I'm going to uninstall as I'm uncomfortable with what's going on.",
      "RANDOM HARD CREDIT CHECKS. Will only tell you after it's happened. Requested to delete account still without response. It's a great business concept, but let people know before they try to purchase a ghost card that a hard credit check will happen before proceeding. Show people their spending limits. This app is not great in comparison to other BNPL apps. - Reply to Klarna - I didn't want to risk lowering my credit rating like others, so I didn't use your app. I want my personal info removed",
      "Worked for two purchases and then it just stopped working, mind you I payed off both purchases early, customer service is a joke, can never solve my issue. I literally just tried using the app again today after at least 4 months, I was told that it just be for the holidays but it's not. It just does not work anymore. Love the concept but I don't like how the company works it. If I could give a zero I would."

Browse Auctions - All items sold on DealDash are brand new and come with manufacturer warranties. DealDash works directly with leading retailers and brands and sells items from their own or their trusted partners' warehouse stock.\r\n\r\n2. Buy Bids - Bids allow you to participate in the auctions that enable you to save money on best-selling brand name items. You’re can purchase bids in a variety of different pack sizes. Bids can be usually purchased for less than $0.20 each.\r\n\r\n3. Start Bidding - All auctions start at $0.00. Each bid placed adds one penny to the final price of the item.

This is done to run up your bids and waste your money.",

      "This app is pretty good for making a list of the special finds you want to purchase. Previously, you could see the finds sorted in your list by which date they were released. Then you could see them sorted by release, though there was no date attached. Now it seems they are all piling together in one mixed up list, which is not useful. You can't delete items based on how old they are.",
      "Not very helpful. I use this app to see what the special buys will be every week, but it no longer separates the list of saved items by date. It's a pain to try to remember which week everything I'm interested in is on sale. The grocery list feature is not user friendly. It would be nice to see what's available or not at my local Aldi. I love shopping at Aldi, but I wish their app was more than just a weekly ad.",
      "I liked this app until the past 2-3 weeks. Or seems to have some glitches going on. 1. The zoom in messes up or won't work at all when trying to get a better look at something. (It's not my phone) 2. When looking at each category the list doesn't go to the top right away, but goes very slow and jerky to the top. It will not let you scroll up. It will pop back down and do it's slow jerky scrolling itself. It's very frustrating. Will give 5☆'s when fixed.",
      "Useless. You can't search by product (ie - mayonnaise), when you do find an item, majority are listed without price but rather \"see price in store.\" I want to be able to search all items on my list and have a good idea how much the total is before I go. Check out the Ralph's app for how it should be done. I love Aldi and am so disappointed with this \"app\" About the only functionality was to be able to look at the weekly ad.",
      "Maybe I am not using it properly, but I would like to be able to click and choose from a product catalog to make my shopping list rather than just typing in what I want to add. I probably won't use the price option because I don't know the prices. Am I expecting something the list option isn't meant to do?"

      "ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!! EVERY TIME I go to Wal-mart now it's simple, quick & easy to price check items using the in app scanner & paying with Walmart pay is easier, faster, more secure & instead of keeping up with paper receipts an easy to find digital receipt is stored in the app making the return process easier, faster & more secure too... In my opinion everyone in the world that even walks in a Walmart store should download this app if they can! I love it that much!!!",
      "The app is a bit buggy. The grocery app is way worse with bugs. But I want to be able to add things in my cart that are in the store only, not just things that are online. I say this BECAUSE the grocery app is buggy. Also, I'll click on something that says out of stock, and it's not, or something that isn't out of stock, but it is. This really needs to be fixed.",
      "Hands down the best all around Consumer Store/Shopping App. From being able to save receipts, start a return, or lookup items and their inventories at multiple locations (which is pretty accurate), to accessing services such as sending/ receiving money or just plain shopping without leaving the comfort of your own home Walmart has set the new standard for other department stores, and so far I haven't come across one that is anywhere near as beneficial in numerous areas as them!!",
      "I go to check out, see that an item isn't available for pickup today, go to edit my cart, and the last half hour of my time (which I could be using to unpack my apartment! ) was apparently wasted. The cart reset when I went to edit it, and now I have to go back and find all the items again. Thanks. Maybe look into this.",
      "Stock information isn't accurate. The search says item is available, but when you select it, it's out of stock. Named In-store aisles don't exist, then the item is out of stock. You can make lists, but can't set alerts for availability. You can't select delivery or pickup before you get into the shopping cart. It's confusing to see pricing you can't fix until you pay. And you should be able to scan your pickup barcode to check in. Not retype order numbers. App needs refinement."

This app will look at your skin color through your camera, and in a couple of minutes, VOILA! It shows you EXACTLY which shade and undertone you need, in all brands as far as I could tell. SOOOOO useful!",

It is easy to use,let's you see how makeup will look on tou,before tou buy it,has quizzes you can take,to figure out what products are best suited for your needs, and you receive points for things that you buy. They also ship quickly.",
      "Works great! Love that I can track my points and see how much I can redeem them for. Only thing is that I wish there was an easier way to add the $3.50 off / 20% off coupons to the check out easier. Something like \"activate code\" option would be nice, I know they already do this for some other special offers.",

Edited... Installed the new version of App. I still have to create a new password every time I try to login! Every. Time.",

I used to live the app and wallet features of the app. I have such a hard time shopping online at Kohl's without my app working properly. Very very upsetting",
      "I don't have a problem signing in but I haven't been able to access my cart for a week now. It's just a blank screen and I've reinstalled the app twice. It would help if Kohl's actually gave us an easy option to contact them to provide feedback about their app, website, etc. so that they can be aware of/review/improve/fix issues. This app needs several other improvements, as well, it is outdated.",
      "Kohls NEED to fix this app ASAP! For the last few months I have trouble seeing the items in my cart! Just recently I cant see any pictures of the items! It just keeps saying \"images coming soon!\" I uninstall and reinstall but it's still not working! I love shopping at Kohls but this app sucks! It's getting annoying too!",
      "Seriously the most frustrating app on my phone. In have a kohls account, and know how to use shopping apps. Issues with this one: searching with the filter for availability to pickup at my store generates results that are not at all available, sometimes not even to ship; Kohls suggested items based on my recent views are often completely out of stock(!!!); app is slow to load each page"

      "I have really enjoyed this app and everything I have received has been exactly like what the picture showed (or the reviews). I do think that reading the reviews is a MUST in order to find out the quality of your item because the photos don’t show it very well and because you can find out how the sizing is. Overall I think that with fun daily incentives, quick shipping that is traceable, cute clothes, and insightful reviews, this app really is one of the best.",
      "At first I was skeptical thinking it would be just like the wish app, but really it’s sooo much better! The deals are great and there are soo many things to choose from for only 4.99 shipping! There are so many discounted items you can get at the store for a MUCH higher price! They have all sizes for clothes and shoes! And you can look at what other people rated on the item to see if it’s the one for you! Overall, this app is amazing!",
      "I use this when I need something new and it comes within a week which is good for online shopping sites. I love to shop on here, I always find tons of new stuff, and I can get lost shopping on here for hours. If you’re looking for any new clothes, accessories, or anything else this a great site!!",
      "I'll be honest,this is just the PERFECT app to buy clothes, decorarions, makeup, and really anything you'd like! The prices are sooo low and the quality is sooooo great! I hope they keep up with that, especially the variety of things on there. Love this app.",
      "I overall love this app I can shop for things that I wouldn’t see in regular stores and in the section where I saw others peoples outfits and you could click on the picture and it would show you the clothes that were from the app. this app is really helpful and there are loads of amazing things on here. This app is the best for online clothes shopping I hope one day everyone is using it."

      "I suggest you show what size the model in the picture is wearing. And have more organized categories. When i use the filter to have a more specific search, alot of things disappear. I always feel like the website has more items than the search is showing me. Aside from those technical website/app issues, the actual products are good quality and very unique. I also love the packaging.",
      "The app is so frustrating when making a purchase as it kept going in a loop about the address while in the mean time the purchase has gone through so now I am not even sure if everything is correct. Also it has doesn't accept my password created.",
      "Your FB ads link to the app rather than the website. This means having to download the app, which then prompts to you make an account before showing you the store. When I finally got to the page of the item I wanted, it wasn't in my size. A lot of effort for absolute nothing. Make your ads link to the website and it'd be a far easier and more pro-costumer move. As is, I am left associating your brand with \"frustration\"",
      "The main problem i personally have with this app is that it does not have a good \"refine\".I mean, it does not have a good amount of options,the only tree it has are \"size\" \"color\" and \"price range\".It's not enough,i prefer to have a lot of choose between the filter i want to add at a certain category(like what kind of jeans do you want,the skinny one,the culotte one,the wide leg one...)like in other app like this one.BUT except for this the app is good,the choise is very varied and i like it.",
      "It was great and all but suddenly one day it signed OUT of my email, and I didn't do that! So every time I want to sign in it says the account is already in use!! I can't go back into my old account!!!! Everything was on it the stuff I wanted to buy!! Zaful please fix this as fast as you can😡"

      "Only allows you to purchase. Can't see your orders, can't view/edit account, can't track packages, and the new points system is trash. Not to mention your points don't convert over and customer service is absolutely NO help! Good thing there are SOOO many other options for me to spend my money. Nice in theory, complete failure in action",
      "This new update is horrible at best, nothing I've done prior has converted over, there's always an error message when I try to see my account information and customer service is of no help at all. I've spent over $2,000 in less than 9 months and this is how you treat paying customers???",
      "This app has been wack for the past few months couldn't log in. Once updated on android I get an error message, mind you it's not just Foot Locker it's also Foot Action & Champs. Definitely deleting all affiliated apps. Sucks especially because the customer service is non existent!!!",
      "New app sucks, they erased all rewards points and have to call and be placed on hold for 30 minutes just to get reward codes. They are trying to wipe away all rewards that ppl have accumulated. They ought to be ashamed of themselves."

      "I have had the ibotta app for awhile. It was exciting at first due to I was shopping and using my ibotta app to earn money. Then I couldn't reset my password to cash out. I sent at least 5-6 emails to the ibotta team and its not working. Everytime i tred to reset it, it said someone else is using the email. So now i can't use my cash back and store reciepts. Its not worth the time. All this work I've done I am through.",
      "This app is a SCAM! Horrible customer service! Once I almost reached the $20 threshold required in order to cash out, suddenly I'm locked out of my account. Constant errors when trying to login, I've been getting a \"Please try again\" error message for 2 weeks. Unable to reset password, absolutely no help from their lack of customer service. I've filed complaints with the app store, and with the BBB. And the dev response below is Garbage. I did what they said and still nothing. SCAM! Try Rakuten",
      "I initially gave 5 stars, but then I had to change it to 3 solely because it seems like the offered items are items I don't use. There used to be the \"For You\" selection that recommended items based on what you regularly buy or save, but lately my \"For You\" selection has been extremely off and the overall selection seems to have diminished. If I do redeem anything, it's for non-brand specific items. Then, when I do not redeem for a certain time, an amount is deducted from my overall savings.",
      "I like the savings with this app and learning about new products. I do geel it could be more user friendly and that at least you should always have credit for wntering a receipt. Also even if you can connect your card you should also be able to submit a receipt. I missed out on 3 deals from a new store because I did not know I needed to connect the card before I went. I spent all that time looking up deals and then did not get them.",
      "The recent update removed the QR code option, and the barcode scanner almost NEVER WORKS. Entering the 20 digit code manually is an unfriendly hassle of a user experience. I'm just about DONE with Ibotta now. It's used to be a good working, friendly, pleasant app. Now it's a hassle, and worst of all, it only finds me a mere FRACTION of the money it used to. Almost worthless now."

      "Worst app ever you will be lucky to receive anything you purchase. When installed it permits itself to control and make changes to every single function on your device it can even control your wifi, scary eh! It gets worse, when you figure it out and disable all these self appointed permissions the device requires a security update a day or so later and everything goes back to the way it was. You are given the option to disable cookies but you can't actually do it .DO NOT INSTALL",
      "I really enjoyed use this app, I being used for almost 4 yrs now, and I really like the price the items and the enormously variation of items. Most everything arrives between 1to 3 months ( 3months was the maximum that I have to wait for a T-shirt one time), and I never get any troubles using my debit card, and they customer service is amazing, never fall me when I need a refund or exchange ect.",
      "I love this app! I think it is wonderful and so much better than wish! This app is fantastic and I shop on it almost constantly! I do wish that they would watch their products a little bit more, just to make sure that no one's ripping people off. I have seen one or two products that were not as the description!! but they are getting really good aboit catching thay stuff!!",
      "Not intuitive and nor easy to use. Need to go hunt around as some function/features not in obvious location. Re-evaluate: Still not intuitive to navigate. Had to sign in whenever I need to confirm delivery. Then had to look high and low for the pages. There are other online site that is very easy to use which I patronise more than this site.",
      "You site is cool but don't like it when you keep suggesting that you know what I am looking for. If I search for an item but the App keeps suggesting that I like other kind of products and every time I open the App the same previous items appear as if I were to keep loving them. I hate that and sometimes feel angry and uninstall the App and will Install it again the next time I wanna shop. I know that's what you think is that people love the same kind of things they search for in the engine"

      "This app is very good bc instead of just small or medium or large sizes it actually has actually measurements so then you definitely know if the outfit is going to fit you! You can sell things on it too, some outfits or clothing-wise are somewhat expensive but you just have to find the right seller! And if you want to make sure the outfit actually fits you, you can message the seller!! I definitely recommend this app!!",
      "Love the app, everyone on here is lovely and it's pretty easy to find stuff I dig. Hoping to sell some of my own stuff too soon, so can only speak as a buyer for now. One issue, sometimes I get this bug where I like an item and the images are replaced with the next item in the explore page... Not sure what would cause this, hope it's patched out soon but not a world ender <3",
      "Some sellers just spam tag on popular keywords/brands making it hard to find what you really want making newer users feel discouraged (search vintage Nike t-shirt and all you get is random tshirts). Listings probably have to be made into sections (or just be able to mute a seller from search) where the title of the listing is only used in search, so sellers don't take advantage of keywords and chuck a heap of brands on the bottom of their description making it easier to find what you want.",
      "It seems like a nice app, but I can't really use it because I can't use PayPal, if they had the Email Transfer option I could use it, but I guess I'll just have to delet this app. People post things for very cheap and good prices, but I can't buy or sell anything because I can't use PayPal.",
      "Overall the app is great! From my experience it is the perfect platform for younger people to start learning about resell and being involved in the fashion community. The app itself could sometimes be bugging with unresponsive buttons. I understand during high traffic hours, is can take multiple attempts to post a listing. On some occasions messages or notifications wont send. I am hopeful that these issues will be fix and the UI will be improved as the app continues to go through updates!"

      "You finally fixed it, wonderful!! Thank you!",
      "I am so hurt to have to give this app one star. Especially when Hobby Lobby is one of my favorite stores. But this is truly a lousy app. There's nowhere on the initial screen to do a search. And when you click on one of the two available categories, the keyboard doesn't work. I wasn't able to find any of the products I usually purchase. Uninstalling.",
      "Other than the Search feature being non-user friendly, I really haven't had a problem with this app until two days ago. It will not let the internal keyboard pop up. I have always been able to click on the search bar, the keyboard pops up, and then I'm able to type in my search. I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and it still will not let me use the keyboard on this app any longer. I checked other apps and the keyboard pops up immediately.",
      "100% not user friendly. I LOOOOVE Hobby Lobby. But I HAAAAATE this app. I can't use my keyboard to search for anything. None of the icons on the home page of the app match up so when you click one icon to look at something, it gives you something completely different. If I get to an item after taking forever to get to a list of products I'm interested in, I cant click on it because if I do, I can't back out of that and resume looking without being kicked to the home page of the app. DELETING IT!",
      "Clicking on categories pictures from the main home page don't match up,. You click one thing like baking and get yarn or yarn and get gift cards. When I finally get to something and try to add a specific quantity to my cart it doesn't allow me too. I'll add one thinking I can change the number in the cart, but it doesn't let do that either. Super frustrating, an app should make it easier to look or things not make it a maze and impossible to navigate. Maybe a new up date will fix it."

      "It's a great app for the most part. The one and only thing that I can't stand about it is that if you put something in your cart, you cannot go back to where you were! (This happens if you click on anything but the description of an item.) Most other retailer's app take you back where you were, why can't this one?! Sorry for the rant, but it is so frustrating to have to search for items again when you should be able to go back to where you were and BE HAPPY with your experience within the app.",
      "Very cumbersome. No easy way to get back to the page you were on after you add an item to the cart. Bait and switch big-time. It told me that I had $39 in points and only let me redeem $17 on a $65 order. No wonder their going out of business! Update..... I placed an order, and part of it was fulfilled by a 3rd party vendor. Those items never arrived, and Sears won't stand behind the order. They keep telling me to contact the vendor (theUniche)and they won't respond to me at all! STAY AWAY!",
      "Always have access to all searches I request. A little slow but usually moves quickly. Have no regrets about this app.",
      "App needs to be more user friendly. The features are there but the functionality on mobile devices is very much below average. Needs to be adjusted as far as the zooming in and out. While doing the aforementioned, the app has a tendency to quickly freeze. Upgrading the software of the app, I believe, would produce better ratings!",
      "My first time using app was an exhausting experience. When I tried to go back in a second time I put in my password for the 1st time and a message came up saying I had exhausted all of my attempts to sign in! Then I had to go thru the process of resetting my password. I'm in it now and the first thing that pops up is a request to rate the app! Ok, I rated it, hopefully I can look at some items and nothing else will happen."

      "I really like this app. You have to stay on top of your cash back though because sometimes it misses it. I always double check after i place an order though so it's not so bad. I am upset they removed Wal-Mart and Amazon from this app because those were the two i used the most. I hope they put them back!",
      "Waste of time. It takes weeks for cash back to be added to your account...if you are credited at all. When you submit an inquiry to see where your cashback dollars are (which is a challenge of its own), you get error messages and can't complete the process. Rakuten, If 0% back on a $500 purchase from Amazon was the special offer, you nailed it. Don't waste your time or data.",
      "Have been using this app for a while (when it was ebates). Love that you get cash back on purchases, however for EVERY Amazon purchase, you have to manually add your purchases.. It's ALWAYS been like this. The missing cash back is quickly added to my account when submitted,, but it's just annoying because I do almost half of my online shopping on Amazon.",
      "Bad for In-Store shopping. This app is more online based, connecting your online shopping accounts and purchases in order to give you cash back. This app also only allows one bank account to be connected, which isn't very flexible for a family. Also, if you want to take pictures of your receipts and your family's receipts, this app is not for you. There is no \"receipt picture taking\" option since this app is more focused on providing coupons while you shop online; then gives u cash back online.",
      "So far so good, there is a few months in between pay periods but at least you have a chance to build up your funds towards a refund check or PayPal. U receive a small% back from shopping, while using this app before you buy. And i love that you can choose from sooo many different stores to shop at. Thank you rakuten(Ebates) app."

      "Horrible. They closed all the stores in my area. I have points in my account but no matter what i try to use them on it wont let me. Item qualifys yet when i got to check out gives no option to use my points. Customer service has not been helpful. I have alot of points i cant use. Dont reccomend this program or the credit card. Ive been a card holder for 10yrs! Spent lots of money and cant use the reward. Im canceling my cards",
      "There is way to pay your bill in the app that I could find other wise for shopping it's very good",
      "I'm done with this... I thought linking this to GasBuddy would be a cool way to save some money. I currently have over $40 in points that I am just going to let expire because, everything I try and buy says it is not available for my zip code. Then after all of that messing around I can almost find what I am looking at for the same price as here. The search is almost impossible to find anything."
