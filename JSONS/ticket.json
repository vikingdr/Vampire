      "Everytime I check events, favorites, notifications, and account the application completely crashes. This is heavily disappointing, because if I were to attend an event and the app crashes I won't be able to go inside the venue. What would be the purpose of having the app then? The application is meant to be accessible to users (who chose to use their phone as their ticket access), but it's pointless if the ticket is inaccessible to us online through the application.",
      "The worst app ever. It logged me out and won't let me back in. I spent way to much money to not be able to see my ticket. I've had the ticket for a month and it decides to do this. Why are you not fixing it. People need their tickets that they paid you way to much money for. It's very nerve wracking not to know if the app will be working in time for my concert. Very poor customer service.",
      "Up until the last update, this app worked okay. Now this last update has caused the app to freeze and shut down every time I try to access an option on the left side bar. Email support is not available to help, rendering this app virtually useless to see the status on postponed/canceled events that I have paid for.",
      "Although I love the Ticketmaster App due to the ease of it, I am disappointed in the fact that we are not getting event updates through the app. I need to know if events are cancelled or rescheduled! I have numerous events that I have purchased tickets for months in advance and we are now coming up on those events without any notice! Your customers need to know and the app would be the best way to disseminate that information! Please add that into the app! We need to know!",
      "Just bought tickets for a concert in a month. I havent been able to log into the app for weeks! Just shows a blank white screen. There is no way I am able to view my QR codes without the app unless I get them mailed to be for an extra fee- which is NOT happening. I have already emailed the customer service and they havent gotten back to me. Please fix the login issue. Time is ticking! (will fix the 1-star review when resoved)"

      "Prior to the last 2 regulation Portland Timbers matches I had issues with the Seat Geek app. On the 1st occasion, I couldn't access my tickets at all and had to get physical tickets from Customer Service. That meant I missed the 1st 20 minutes of a match. The next time I couldn't send the tickets at all when I wasn't able attend. Again, why should I have to go to customer service to get this fixed? Please fix the app.",
      "They take a service fee to provide ONE service - legit tickets. Imagine getting all excited for a show with your friends, and then getting there and being told your ticket had 'already been scanned' and you cannot enter. On top of that it's taken over a week to get a refund. DO NOT USE. --- I got my refund but +20% didn't even cover the cost of getting to the event not to mention the exteme disappointment of finding out you weren't going to get to see the show.",
      "Why do you need to send an email to verify the payout method and why is this information no where on the app or mobile site? I had to login to the full site on a computer to figure out what the issue was for selling tickets. There should be functionality in the app to upload your government ID or AT LEAST an error message with the appropriate information. You can't even view how much you spent on tickets without using the full site.",

Do yourself a favor and load before you get to the venue, a screenshot will also work. Cheers!",
      "The experience in buying tickets is very easy but over time the fee amount above the actual ticket price has raised significantly since first coming out and they do not indicate what it is for. It'll give you a price for each individual ticket and then once selected have a total for you to buy much above the ticket price and no where does it explain what the extra money is for before you pay for them. Also for concerts, if arena name is too long it doesn't show the city it is in within the space",
      "Game time is the ticket app I use for my Orioles tickets, the prices are lower by far over every other app I've used and the interface is very attractive. The veiw of my seat is probably my favorite feature. It's very extensive so I can do all of my event searching in just one place. Thank you gametime and keep up the good work!",
      "Took a long time and several attempts trying numerous log ins to finally get into the Game time ap. Made very nervous of my recent purchase and took time away from the many other things I was to do instead of fight with this. I just hope I get my tickets and will be able to get into game??? When I can view them I think I'm going to print them out if I can just to be on the safe side. Very inconvenient.",
      "My favorite app to use for spring training games in Arizona. Fees are relatively high compared to other sites, however prices are almost always lower than StubHub, SeatGeek or others. Usually a lower all in price to purchase tickets. Selling tickets is also much easier because the app automatically sets the price to be competitive in the market. I have had very good success selling tickets. GREAT APP for last minute ticket transactions"

My first purchase of tickets: I was on the phone with their representative for the first 45 min of a concert because the virtual tickets were unable to scan. Before they finally sent me new tickets that were not corrupt. The second purchase: The date of my concert was postponed, and when I asked to exchange or refund my tickets they told me that was not possible, AND it is not possible for me to resell my tickets on their website or app.",
      "Horrible! A giant pain to access tickets. High fees. On top of that, I can't download my ticket from the app. If the app is down, I'm screwed. Just want my f###ing tickets emailed or downloaded. Too much to ask after I paid a 30% fee for the service? Aparently so. Never again.",
      "More verification steps than my bank and more sketchy-looking than a pirate NFL stream, but it's the only way I could get tickets ahead of the game. And why the hell can't I print my damn tickets? Oh yeah, cause they want to be on my phone. Uninstalling the minute I'm through the gate but they already got my data. All I can do is leave this review and go back to scalpers next time.",
      "I was looking for tickets to a concert. When I started to fill out the info for the tickets when it came to the part for payment I put in the info of credit card and right away I get a notification from my back that there were 4 charges from vivid seats and I never hit ( place order ) button. Now I'm charged for tickets I never purchased",
      "Only use this app of you're desperate, because the service fees are f'n ridiculously high! 2 tickets cost me an extra $103.44! I then paid $24.00 for event insurance, but that is on me. The price shown should include taxes and fees. Other wise your getting blindsided with extra cost!"

      "Bad experience leads to a poor rating and negative comments. I purchased tickets to a off Broadway play in NY a week prior. The tickets weren't available for download 'til a before the play. With StubHub's guarantee I trusted that I would be good to and I could go ahead and plan the rest of my trip. Did I forget to mention that my wife and I flew in from TX. After a flight, checking into our hotel, and around 10 pm the day before the play, we still had no tickets. Horrible experience for sure.",
      "The app works fine, I even sold tickets that I purchased by accident to someone else through stubhub, I am not going to be buying anymore tickets though because the fees are ridiculous. I paid double because of my mistake but the fees are just not worth it... so expect the fees when purchasing tickets.... I've been using them for years but in finally fed up with paying so much...",
      "I found it difficult to find my tickets. I didn't know where to find them. Was not aware that the tickets were sent to Ticketmaster. It was very confusing..finally found them and needed the help of MSG to get them on my phone. I feel there should be better instruction when you make the purchase.",
      "Its important to make sure the email address is correct before you buy tickets, i screwed up and my tickets went to a deactivated acct.but StubHub made it right and we made it to the show...it was fantastic",
      "Great service! Tickets always delivered in time for game! Information and updates sent in timely fashion. StubHub is the best for tickets"

      "I heard about this app because of the Friday Forty lottery to win cheap tickets to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I won that lottery after a couple months of entering and the process was so easy and smooth. I loved the seats I was given and it was a great experience. I have since found that they also sell tickets to heaps of other theatre productions and ballets that I'm interested in and they always have great rush deals which I love. Definitely recommend this app to theatre lovers!",
      "Was an easy app to use. Everything went really smoothly. Tickets were ready at the box office. Great seats and great last minute price. Highly recommend.",
      "Great app. Pretty easy to use. Gives you quick look up and convenient bookmark options - I love the rush lotteries! It allows you an ample countdown option so you are able to make the time. I wish it had more detailed info on the show for preview or a link to expand for more. For purchases> GOOD prices, just wish your fee charges were a bit lower per ticket.. A Seat number and or highlighted seat area would be much more helpful. Unfortunately dont know exactly where your seats would be.",
      "I use TDF for the best discounts but if a show I really want to see is not on the site, TodayTix is always my back up plan and almost always comes through. Seat locations are generally good, sometimes excellent. Prices help keep theater going affordable for me. App is very easy to use and always has a wide selection of offerings. Purchase process is simple and forgiving if you need to go back and change or adjust something. The email notifications are also helpful reminders and provide all the necessary details.",
      "Really like this app. and I use it a lot. They have more shows and time choices than other sites as well as offering same day rush ticket options on some plays. Their only down side is that their prices are higher that some other websites, but they are still lower than most box offices and the big commercial ticket seller websites."

      "This is utter garbage. I'd rate it zero stars if possible. I don't want to be forced to install an app to display a QR code to enter an event. This experience makes me want to avoid shows ticketed by AXS in the future. I guess its easy to be just a bit less evil than Ticketmaster but that doesn't make you good. ***Update*** Axs replied with some milquetoast trash about how they're providing a great experience when in fact any part of the experience they're providing is the opposite of what I want out of a ticketing app (i.e. for it to NOT EXIST AT ALL). I went ahead and reported this app for violations to GDPR since it doesn't have a way to delete your information.",
      "I don't care how \"unique\" this app might be. I prefer to print PDF tickets & resent being forced to install an app I don't want, and that must reside in internal memory, on my Smartphone. God help you, if you have a bad data connection or any type of phone failure at the venue. Also, a $20 service fee for a digital ticket is highway robbery. Whenever I can, I prefer to buy tickets directly from the box office. In this case, unfortunately, I must use AXS, a company I avoid whenever possible. 👎👎",
      "I need my tickets for an event tonight and ordered them months ago, I've been trying to download this app for two days and it will not download, whether or not the download issue is your fault or Google plays doesn't matter, the fact that I have been trying for this long and there is no backup way to access my tickets even through my email is complete bs",
      "Garbage. Requiring an app to get your tickets is slimy. Of course this junk immediately requests location permissions. Ugh. No. Also it overrides your brightness setting. Screw this app. Shady company, piece of junk app. All they want is to harvest your data and sell it while charging you a fee for the convenience of it. Scumbags.",
      "Update to 2 stars: I just wanted 45 minutes with customer service trying to get tickets transferred! Terrible app terrible customer service. I've never had so much difficulty than trying to use tickets through the axs app. I would much rather get email tickets that I can just show the venue on my phone. I will be installing this app just for ticketing and deleting it when I am done. It is nonsense to continually have to have an app on my phone just for concert tickets."

      "Only works if you have your ticket #. I rented a car and every time I put in the plate it wouldn't even load an error. Instead it just would never process. Even when I went online in a computer an error would come up and the box would disappear never even letting me read the first word. I finally got a screenshot and was able to read it and it refused to give me my ticket because it was for a rental. I had to contact the cops to find the ticket. I couldn't pay the ticket until I had the number!",
      "1) the app can be more intuitive 2) despite presenting evidence you are most likely going to find yourself paying the ticket you were given. Seems like the traffic police are seen more as a collection service to the city instead of an agency that helps relieve traffic congestion. That said paying via an app is easier than mailing it in or going to court.",
      "I am uninstalling the Park NYC app. The second time I am receiving a ticket while my session on the Park NYC app is active. If you want added work then parking using the official Park NYC app works. You will get a ticket but install Pay or Dispute and waste time and energy explaining why you bothered with either of these apps to begin with.",
      "Could not see payment window after scanning bar code. There was no option for \"Done\" or \"Continue\". Turns out the payment window was hidden underneath. They make it easy to ticket you, but do not make it easy to pay. Makes me want to go back to NYC real soon! That's okay. Thay have plenty of other tourists. They don't need my business!",
      "Awesome experience so far, this app definitely is useful and saves you a ton of time with fighting parking tickets. If you have your receipt clearly displayed just take multiple pictures of your dashboard, the ticket itself along with the zone number, if a machine is down also take a picture and easily submit it. Very easy app to use and very convenient."

The tickets we purchased were very reasonable and the ballpark experience was incredible. Even got to witness a walk off Home run!\r\n\r\nCheapest price for the same tickets by far. I checked StubHub, Vivid and Ticketmaster resale site and these were the cheapest.\r\n\r\nI went to Stubhub like normal and was fixing to pay $80+ in service fees. I looked around and got the same exact tickets without the service fees! \r\n\r\nThey have an amazing selection of tickets, especially well-priced re-sale tix for broadway shows.\r\n\r\nOrdered tickets to the MLB game (Nationals vs Marlins) online while in Washington, DC.

I have to buy an additional ticket every time now. Please fix this. Otherwise it's a great option to have.",
      "You need to update and fix this app. Last week the colors weren't changing to the appropriate transfer, and just now the store keeps giving me an error message whenever i try to buy a ticket. I have zero cash or back up and i am depending on this to get me to work. So fix it if this is supposed to replace cash. Otherwise you will continue to screw over the people who depend on it",
      "This app, now 3 years old, is awful. Errors out to the tickets page frequently, often takes MINUTES to load and display my ticket, even when it was previously activated. Sometimes has a big where it shows the wrong transfer color for the day. When a ticket expires, it displays a dialog box \"error\" although that is clearly not an error. Terrible responsiveness when you contact customer service through the app. This app shpuld be trashed and something new created. After three years, will uninstall",
      "First, I'm really thankful Metro makes this option available - I commute exclusively by bus/bike and it's so handy to have this if I can't find my pass. Unfortunately I can't seem to get a ticket ready in time to present it to the driver as I'm boarding, because it keeps telling me I need to \"redownload\" my tickets to use them even tho I am connected to data. Shutting off WiFi and closing/re-opening the app seems to resolve it after a few tries, but by then then it's too late.",
      "Works good for buses for me. You can prebuy many bus tickets; they save on your phone and don't expire. But not lightrail, those are 1 week max. Also lightrail doesn't take certain cards. Payment option just doesn't show up. Possibly confusing. Probably bad if you lose phone service before activating ticket, which can happen underground. When you first open app in the morning it wants to redownload tickets for some reason. Doesn't seem to react until app is again opened."

      "Very easy to use, I saw two movies during December. Love the app.",
      "Convenient and super nice that it has everything all in the app. One stop shop. The service fee is annoying but I don't see anything outside of matinee times really and I'm a crown club member so it all works out. You can watch trailers for all movies and no need to look up individual theatres.",
      "Easy to use, a few fixes could make it great. Overall the app is really good. Lots of theater options, trailers and I like the QR codes for tickets. My only complaint is, depending on how you select the theater, sometimes the movie showtime buttons don't show up fully on the screen. Probably an aspect ratio issue, as you can see part of the buttons but can't read the times. Also, I wish the qty selection wouldn't take you to another screen. Just put +/- buttons to select qty of tickets.",
      "Needed to change the movie time after already purchasing my tickets. Was able to do so with the app in just a few seconds, no hassle or extra fee. Great deal considering I just spent 20mins on the phone with the movie theater trying to resolve this same issue (with no real help btw) before realizing it could be done with the app smh. Get/explore/use the app!",
      "I absolutely hate the full-screen popup ads every time I open the app and occasionally while I am searching through movies or theaters. I am here because I am buying movie tickets! You already have my business! You do not need to advertise to me! I have lost count of how many times I have actually clicked on an ad that popped up right when I was about to tap on something else, and it's a terrible user experience all around."

      "I love this AP. It's a quick easy way to find and buy tickets which I love because I go to a ton of concerts. I have to seek out alot of shows though where I wish they were brought to me by Live Nation instead. I've even missed some shows from venues I frequent(❤) that I definitely would've went to if the info was brought to me. Keep making it better and I'll keep using the Ap!",
      "Absolutely horrid. I only used this app because it was the only way to see the band I wanted. Repeated issues recognizing my account and logging me in. I had to submit a support ticket less than five minutes after buying my tickets, because the app (and different browsers) won't recognize my account which means I'd be out of luck trying to redeem my tickets at a show. After I attend this show I'm deleting my account. I'd rather miss future concerts than ever use this app again.",
      "Every time I want to use this app I have to uninstall it then reinstall it!! Now it keeps saying check network settings, what do you want me to check??",
      "Keeps making me log in, which is probably why it's also clunky to use.",
      "Bad way to get tickets Livenation doesn't allow printing of tickets. The app says \"your phone is your ticket,\" but Livenation for phone is nothing but a spinner. I have internet and can load any webpage or video, just not my Livenation tickets. Would not use again."

It was working fine before. Ugh super annoyed. Update: It started working for a bit, but now back to the same issue. Please just put it back like it was. It worked fine before. Why did you have to mess with it. Fix your bugs.",
      "Takes away your winning tickets. I had 3 winning tickets, verified them number by number with info on lottery website. I wanted to double check them before entering store to cash them. App scanned ticket and then was connecting to server indefinitely. I restarted it and tried another ticket, with same results. Then, inside store, cashier scanned them and told me the system shows these tickets being already cashed. Will never use this pathetic piece of software again.",
      "Update 1/13/20: Still LAME. 1. Is this the CAT style of barcode reader? Totally different when scanning, have to rotate phone to landscape view and hold ticket far away to scan. Does scan the ticket now but not very user friendly. 2. After scanning, from the results screen, when I hit \"Back\" to scan another ticket it asks if I want to save the results of the current scan, EVERY TIME. Where is the setup screen to change this? Privacy policy link not working.",

I have cleared Cache, Removed data, Reinstalled and nothing just like Jesse reported on 12/21/19. This app for some is totally useless my rating should be 0 ☆ (stars). Can you suggest another app that works?"

      "The user interface is just fine. Pretty standard for something like this. Nothing special and nothing bad. HOWEVER!!! As soon as I sign up, I start getting telemarketer calls. I went from having 1 or 2 a week to 10 a day. They will sell your info even if you uncheck the boxes to not share. Those boxes only keep Eventbrite from filling your email with garbage. Keep this in mind when buying from them or making a profile.",
      "Love this app! It's helped me discover so many more events in London - the \"free stuff only\" is great too! However, they really need to add more filters such as price and distance ranges, see events on a map, sort by what's closest to you etc. as some searches come back with thousands of results! Still highly recommend this app though :)",
      "This app is great for finding events, but one point I would like to address, is that since events occur in cities, there is no need for the grainy location to be provided, such as when searching, adding Amman will provide different results from the location it chose for me, which is Balqa, which they are close to each other. So just giving a broader way of searching could be better and provide better results, as I found some difficulties browsing events.",
      "\"Meh.\" I've been using Eventbrite for over a decade ... The app? User experience is oversimplified, to the point of uselessness. You cannot \"follow\" a performer or venue, you can't even search for a venue or town, even if THEY ARE LISTED in events. Waste.",
      "I can't log into the app to see my ticket purchase, all it does is send me emails (7 to be exact) to change my password and nothing happens when I do change it. I had to reach out to the promoter of the event just to make sure I can use the email I received to verify my ticket purchase."

It also has problems when you want to go back to the previous page and it won't go back",
      "This app is okay but it has one really annoying \"feature\" and that is that you cannot add a payment card prior to making a purchase. I ride the commuter rail very infrequently and for whatever reason it lost the card info from the last time I bought a ticket. I'm not good with the on-screen keyboard on my phone and when I went to purchase a ticket just now, it took forever because I had to re-enter my credit card info. It would have been much better if I could have done that beforehand, but that apparently is not possible. Also this is NOT the fault of the app, but the fact that the commuter rail and subway use completely different payment systems is ridiculous. A CharlieCard would be 10x easier to use than this app.",

      "I love how it lets me know about upcoming shows! The notifications for things like pre-sales is helpful too. My only complaints are (1) there is a show from last month that has been frozen at the top of the locations menu, (2) it keeps insisting that I'm following an artist that I am not, and (3) if you add an artist, the app will not automatically tell you if there is a show soon. Those are only minor issues that in no way prevent me from using the app and regularly adding more artists.",
      "I love to use this application when I want to go to shows near me, it also opened me up to new bands I never listened to before, but there are a few things that I think should be tweaked, like widening the search to a state instead of a city, making the notifications less often, and possibly even a genre search, so I can find even more bands that I might like, good app, and if you take my advice, I would 100% give 5 star.",
      "I liked this app before the nag notifications were added. The whole point of downloading this app for me (and probably just about everyone else) is to be notified when new concerts are announced; however, now that I'm receiving notifications that my \"concert calendar needs some love,\" it's just annoying. The fact that I cannot select which notifications I want to receive and which I do not is a deal breaker.",
      "Barely functional. Used to give great updates when bands were coming now they added like 80 bands I've never heard of and have no interest in seeing because usually they're in a totally different genre than the one I enjoy. Uninstalling cuz it's a waste of time when I get excited when I see a notification that a band is coming and it's something I've never heard of nor want to see.",
      "Have been using this app for a while and it's brilliant - I find out when the bands I've selected are playing in the areas I've chosen pretty much as soon as they are announced. It's easy to look at them in a calendar view to track the year ahead. And it's easy to then just click through and purchase tickets. A must have have for any avid concert-goer."

My parking ticket was unjust but I didn't want to waste my time fighting this legal battle, so I thought I'd give this a try. It actually works but the process took about 2 months cause of scheduling and hearing. I would recommend giving this app a try, who knows, it might help. Doesn't hurt to try.",

Then when it locks me out I have to make a new account. Just now I had a round-trip ticket but it locked me out so I had to make a third account and buy a new one-way. Ridiculous. It's always been like this ever since I got the app years ago. Please fix asap.",

      "Horrible, once you submit the payment that's it the tickets are yours. I called 5 min after purchasing them and they have a no refund policy. Beware",
      "SCAM, COMPLETE SCAM! Please buy elsewhere. We had an emergency surgery for our 2 month old daughter (that we weren't able to schedule) which made going to our event impossible. Although we told them about this, they rudely refused any refund, or to even send us our tickets earlier than 24 hours before the event. They did this so that we couldn't resell them. We just recoup our money back. Very very disappointed, and will never use this company again.",
      "Definitely like how quick and easy the Checkout is - just don't like the paying part lol",
      "SCAM! SCAM! SCAM! Even their name is designed to fool you into thinking that your on \"Ticketmaster\". If you get the insurance you need to provide a Dr note to get your money back. The customer service sucks and they don't try to help you (or even respond to you at all. To many Hidden charges to much up sale. And the website is very glitchy.",

      "honestly you can beat this app! Great collection of tickets with the best rates. I have used this app few times now and haven't had any issues. So far it has been very user-friendly. The best part is they didnt charge me all the crazy fees that most sites charge for buying the tickets...",

Just to name a few. I use this 3 times a week commuting from Baltimore to DC and love it. Save time and paper!",
      "Wonderfully easy to navigate & use. After you buy your first tickets, each subsequent time you open the app, it opens to the \"Buy Tickets\" page and the \"Buy Again\" feature, which is almost always why you you need to go there in the first place. Very handy. Also very easy to check your account settings and history.",
      "Makes everything easy and convenient. I like that the monthly pass goes by number of days and not an actual month. If I buy it on the 26th, it's good for 31 days as opposed to the month of September. Saves me money!",
      "So the app has improved and I love the fact that you can buy the pass with your debit card and I like how the monthly pass last longer when purchase on a later date. It is very useful to me! Keep up the good work!👍🏼👍🏽😁",
      "I love the app, i just think its wasteful to still be given a paper ticket. instead of just letting people go through Or changing the gates to be able to scan the code on the phone."

      "This is a waste of money. For an entire month I was unable to get any of the tickets I wanted. Plus, under Local there were events that were free to everyone & InWeGo was acting like, \"look at these free tickets for members.\" The bidding & waiting for a chance to get tickets is also a pain. Even if you get yourself a ticket, guest tickets are more than you normally pay online. There is no value in this membership.",
      "THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE APP from \"InWeGo\" to \"LetItGo\". WHY? Because once you get started on this app all you want to do is let it go... To begin with, I got sucked into this app off of a DECEITFUL PROMOTION on Black Friday, after getting started on this app, I realized that I have to pay EXTRA for events that are FREE to the public outside of this app that charges extra $$ to bring a friend to the FREE events offered to the public. #Shameful",
      "App does not work. Great concept, way too many bugs once you try to use. I have now been charged $40 in \"no show fees\" because once i got to the game i could not download my ticket. So i had to end up buying tickets at the door. The options for events i acually want to go to are limited and there are never tickets available. Even when i have full bars the app says \"error no internet connection\" I have already unsubscibed and i will be deleting this app. Would be nice if they could reimburse me.",
      "It used to be so much better. Now you have to work really hard to go to an event that you are interested in or that is popular. The current price does not match the current experience. Inwego a year ago was a much better user experience. Now, there are too many Inwego users and the ticket numbers and offers have not been scaled to match the demand.",
      "Been a member for about 2 months and so far so good!! I'm really enjoying get out more and you can't beat the price! I wish there was an option to pay money for points though! Because I like bidding concept when tickets are almost sold out!"

Anytime you see Viagogo selling you tickets, RUN!!!!",

That means that I lose the chance to enjoy the concert and it was a birthday gift to my wife. I do not understand how it work but for me does not works. They want to sale something that they dont have. I do not recommend this app.",

When login in, it tells me I have no purchases made, but the money went off my account, and I recieved an order ID via my email. When I go to how to contact viagogo, it tells me to select \"my purchases\" but then when I click on my purchases, it redirects me to the page saying I have no purchases - with no other option. I'm starting to feel like this was a scam.",

      "Dont book tickets in this app🙅🙅 its a warning... they'll receive the money but they won't allot seats....ticket is never booked...u won't receive any confirmations..... you'll lose ur money for sure......if u call them and ask they give a tricky answer \" we didn't receive the money .....it is in the bank gateway.....the bank is responsible to refund 🤦🤦\" they'll say u'll receive ur money in 3-10days...... but it never happens don't expect ur money back.....l",
      "Horrible experience i had booked a PVR ticket.. i wanted to cancel it .. but there is no option . PVR cinemas have a cancellation policy so.. why not?? I called customer service the minute I said about cancellation they blocked me ! What audicity. This is absolutely haressing NEVER buy Tickets from this app.. . Buy from PVR cinemas itself."

      "Used to work, now just gives a \"LICENSE_FAILED_ACTIVATION_4001\" error when you try to scan a ticket. Uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared cache, nothing. Totally broken since last update.",
      "Wow what a giant waste of time I should have just never downloaded the app and paid attention to the reviews it's scanned one ticket then went to a black screen and never worked again absolutely the worst app I've ever come across",
      "Don't bother if you want scan scratch-offs! I downloaded the app because despite being pretty sure I hadn't won anything on my scratch off, I wanted to make sure. so, I downloaded the app, scanned my ticket & just sat there, spinning. So, I tried another ticket, same thing. I uninstalled the app, reinstalled the app and it still does not work. I've got a note 10 + through T-Mobile."

      "This app is awesome! Was able to get a greyhound ticket that departed that same day & was sold out on greyhounds website. Not only that, but it was also for less than half the price too! I hope one day it will expand to include even more modes of travel & companies. Oh by the way, I actually found wanderu through their website, not the app, & for some reason I could not purchase the ticket through the browser on my PC or my phone browser but it worked in the App I don't know why....",

      "App is OK. The event share link is for email (should provide options or allow a default option) - you have to do a search to find out that one can share OTHER than using email - which is a STUPID design choice for a mobile app (extra clicks!?). Secondly, when the Google maps link is selected it directs Maps to start in \"directions\" mode. It should open Maps to the location. One can easily select \"directions\" from the location. One CAN'T do is easily get the business name and address to share!",
      "The Layout is confusing at times. Especially when you want to get to the band's you followed which should be something obvious and not as hidden as it is. It's a app you don't stare at hours of the day so it should be easy to learn and relearn. Other than that, top notch information about the tour plans of my bands.",
      "Good app. Though maximum radius is not enogh. I can't even monitor towns 4 hours drive away. Another option would be to monitor several towns at the same time... which is also impossible. So I've ended up to switch some locations around, once in a while...which equals to 3 stars experience.",
      "I only downloaded this app to purchase tickets to a specific show. I don't want to give access to my location, nor do I need the app to tell me what's available in my area. It would not let me proceed to purchase my tickets without allowing access to my location."

      "Terrible app, never worked on mobile, over cellular or wifi. Truthfully the entire service is a terrible investment overall. My team was good this year so half the games were flexed to primetime, which means I only needed this service about 6 games. One week the entire service was down for the 1 o clock games, and 1 game I needed mobile and didn't work. Garbage, Garbage, Garbage",
      "Sometimes it loads, sometimes it won't. Sometimes it plays, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it just stops and drops out. Totally unacceptable for the amount we're paying, and for a company the size of ATT/ DirecTV...",
      "So far we have had horrible experience with the app. There are connectivity issues, server issues, poor streaming, and it frequently changes from the game you are trying to watch to the fantasy zone channel. Not worth the money spent for Sunday Ticket when you can't even watch the games.",
      "I pay for this to use when traveling. Whenever i travel I'm told the game is blacked out. It can't be because it's in my area, I am out of the country and want to watch my game. Not sure why it makes any difference where I sign to stream live. The inconvenience does not match with the cost of I can't use it.",
      "Horrible horrible app, we paid for this because we live in California and my husband is a Chicago Bears fan, so the ONLY game that should be blacked out of when they're against a California team......so explain to me why every game has been blacked out? I tried to contact the customer service listed I'm the contacts to either a) resolve the issue or b) get my money back seeing as this is a useless app and I got an email back saying the email listed isn't valid....so no way to contact them 😒"

      "App is fine but could be better. I like how I can quickly book trips and skip going to counter. It remembers what I did previously which is nice. Negatives for me would be bus tracker does not work when looking at individual ticket but when you go to main bus tracker part of app you can put in your bus number. The other bigger negative is when looking at your trips there doesn't seem to be any order into the way they are displayed. I have to look through a random list to find my ticket.",
      "Needs to have more ways to pay for the ticket instead of the usual way of going to the website which takes more data to load up the page. Vs the app having the pay pal option or just cash payment option. And being able to see the reservation in the app and store it in Mobile wallet in case you get locked out of your email account.",
      "The worst travel experience you'll ever have starts with this app. Ticket selection sucks. It will automatically change your selection to a different boarding station without letting you know... causing confusion and mistakes. Then the \"track bus\" will fail to load, so you can't check whether the bus is late or if you're in the wrong station... More confusion... Finally, schedule numbers, confirmation numbers, and station addresses are all located on different menus... An amazingly awful app.",
      "Signed in to a friend's account to pay for their ticket for it to change the passengers name to mine resulting in me having to pay to change the name back to theirs. That doesn't make sense. I shouldn't have to go back and change anything if it's already there to begin with. As soon as I put in my card info, I guess it changes the passengers name????? WHY? That's the whole point of me signing into their account, so all the info is already in place, so I can just put my card info in and be done.",
      "The app is pretty easy to use. My advice, book single trip tickets instead of round trip. If your plans change you won't lose too much money."

      "Terrible. Chat never available. Cancel feature broken. Called multiple times to hear a recording that the service was not available. When I finally got through, the agent uttered I was being unresponsive and quickly hung up while I was talking. She literally gave me 1 second to reply while on hold for over 2 hours. Now I'm stranded outside the country in this crisis because the airline canceled a flight and put me on a connection before the first flight. I'm not a time traveler. Thanks Expedia!",
      "This app sucks, how did it get 4.5 stars? You will NOT GET ANY REFUND if you cancel a flight. You will only get CREDITS can only be redeemed by calling them. You cannot use your credits on the app!!! And they have some technical issues so you cannot call them to book a flight. So your refund money is gone. The app sucks.",
      "DO NOT BOOK TRAVEL WITH THIS APP!!! Due to covid19, we had flights booked. The airline canceled our flights but cannot refund us because we booked with Expedia. Expedia's robotic call system will not allow us to speak to an agent and there is STILL no option on the app for a refund. We are trapped in a foreign country as they have our money and we cannot book another flight. We are not the only ones. UPDATE: Your reply matches Expedia's Mar 12 email, but nothing has changed with ref to refunds.",
      "I found the travel insurance that is offered to be useless in the face of a real emergency. I purchased my trip long before the COVID virus was announced. I am outraged that the travel insurance company was allowed to add a bunch of exclusions concerning COVID-19 long after my purchase. AIG altered the policy to avoid paying out. In my opinion, the insurance offered is a scam.",

      "Patience helpful, but considering the complexity and enormity of content, it works. Train Status function very helpful, as most trains are reliably not on time. Can be clunky. Useful to browse routes, learn about connections, make reservations. Many, many rules apply; critical to understand before purchase. App details most of it.",
      "Convenient but Glitchy. It is a must if traveling on Amtrak, but it will often display an outdated trip count for multi-ride passes, 1 out of 10 times ticket purchasing doesn't work, and some days the app will not let either of my two phones login to show the conductor my ticket. Always keep a paper copy on hand or a receipt with the QR code in your email as a backup. But even with those issues, I use it every day and it is great for tracking and using Amtrak on the go.",
      "This app is almost useless unless you know where the train routes go. There's hundreds of stations that don't connect so you have to play a guessing game for hours to attempt to plan a trip.",
      "Terrible. Glitchy. Round trip tickets do not show up. every time I want to use a multi-ride ticket, I have to search through my email, find the number, go back to the app, then search for the ticket. it's insane. Also it doesn't show how many points my account has. That's not really important, but the fact that the app doesn't update from whatever database they have just shows another flaw. Sometimes it crashes without reason, other times it won't let you buy tickets without any error codes.",
      "You can check the train schedule, buy your tickets and use this app to board the train. Really convenient! No standing in line to buy tickets."
