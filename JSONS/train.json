      "As far as free mobile train Sims/apps go, this is probably one of the best I've come across thus far. It has a decent core of recognizable engines, with large maps that take several min. to loop around - complete with station and junction stops along the line. The rolling stock can be uncoupled and shunted, passengers can be let off at stations, controls are easy to follow, and while it has some limitations (namely but understandably graphics and r-stock variety,) it's overall a solid Sim/game.",
      "NEW UPDATE! Best train 🚆 sim hands-down! More 🚆 choices: Stephenson's 🚀 & a ✋ cart - amazing fun steam, diesel loco's, even the GG1 is here! Why the best? Free 2 play all trains & all routes! Free 2 add double-header locomotives, free 2 customize the game & free kids app pack! 💯% app support with updates! Achievements, weather, snow, rain you name it, you got it. This is Zen 🚆 meditation 🙏 for 📷 🚆 foamers! WISH LIST - China, Africa, Peru trains & maps! 1 map old-time 1800's Wild West!",
      "I'm going to assume its the Chromebook... I tried a car game, it failed. I tried this train simulator, it too failed. I don't know what to say about this except, ditch the chromebook for basics only and just buy a laptop already. It looks cool, but I can't keep loading from the bottom of the barrel everytime.",
      "I like the game but i want more i want a green saddle tank engine and narrow gauge engines that would make the game way more exciting and a narrow gaugle railway would be nice and more characters from thomas and friends that would make the game way MORE EXCITING",
      "I like this game but I want more powerful engine to complete the hole track and in this game many of places to experience this game is so much amazing and my name is Ronit."

      "I love this game so much. But you have to pay for V.I.P ☺🥰💗💜❤",
      "Not a bad little game, very easy but not bad at all. Could have a few more features to make it better, multiple trains that can only go to their colour station etc. The most annoying thing is the ads (same with all these new games) I understand that to have a free game you have to make money by using ads but there's a limit before it gets annoying. When you ask me if I want to watch an ad to get a new item etc and I say no thanks, don't then play an ad before I can start the game again!",
      "I give it a one star because i just started playing the game and it popped up rated the game ! Honestly I think they should wait a little bit more before asking them to rate the game only on level 2 people ! Edit: so playing the game and a ad pop's up and just a tiny little one I closed the ad and there where just this white background and it will not come off I try everything and it won't come off and upgrade your space for rates please do not download game ! I am telling do download game",
      "The game is mindless fun but not very challenging. I think it would be great for kids. I completed about 80 levels in about an hour. The animal trains are cool, especially the bat train. It would be great if there were bigger more complex tracks. The sounds were cool too! No problems with this game: wirks great!"

      "I love this simulator!! This is the closest thing to reality as you can get without hiring on to the railroad. I'm more into the freight delivery part than everything else. Wish this could be more elaborate. The sandboxes need much more work. What's the point of the number system for train building when you end up getting very little to play with on such a giant map full of dead ends? I'm impressed with the realism.The only thing I hate is the power consumption, even on low graffics. Good job",
      "The game after current update game is nice but while we start driving and leave the station there is only one track on which our train running I want 4-5 track after leaving the station and on it every after 2min train run on other track which is empty and in passenger loop there is no passenger there should be people on station and near building please make it happened than only I will 5 stars to this game and yes this game is very very nice thanks for reading I will wait for new update.",
      "Overall great game however there are some minor glitches I am sure they plan on fixing, most of them wouldn't even lose a star over, however there are a few more annoying ones such as when you select spawn reversed it spawns sideways and off the tracks, random derailments at one of the switches on the train builder map(although this could just be me screwing up somehow) extreme difficulty getting up hill for some engines(although this might be intended to make it more realistic)",
      "Fun game but the the controls are hard and so small go use. The graphics can be a lot better. The controls can be a lot better and little different. Other then that this game is fun...",
      "You can get more credits to spawn trains, just watch an ad for 20 points and you can have super long trains to play with after a few ads. Love the different loco paint jobs available now too. Easy infograpghic cards explain what to do for the scenarios, but It isn't clear that ALL sandbox levels have a train builder! Can't wait to see more functionality added in the future, would be good to see more complex freight delivery /switching missions."

      "Can be fun. I was hoping opening a new region would not use the same dispatchers. Since everything takes so long to complete. Every region should have a new set of dispatchers. It takes so long to complete things now, and level, and opening new regions you have to levels of 100s. Time rate should drop if levels are so high. And separate dispatchers for new regions. Then this game would be playable.",
      "Whole lot of ho-humm. There are 100's of games with the same 'strategy', that is you need x units of item1 + y units of item2 to make item3, and so on... However, in this game you have a predefined layout (track, sources, destinations are already set) and predefined goals to advance. Sorta (and only sorta) interesting at the beginning but as you advance it quickly wears thin. There are lots of better games out there. By-the-way, the images in the advert are not representative of the game.",
      "I was initially impressed with the game and the game play. If I would have known how often the game crashes I would have deleted it before I began. Please use the $20 I spent on your game to stop the crashing. Maybe one day when the game stops closing every 30 seconds it can be a 5star game. You've made it feel like a living, breathing town to your disadvantage. Kind of hard to enjoy the realism of 50 NPC cars driving on the roads when all that \"busy-ness\" is what causes the game to crash.",
      "Train station 1, is a legend. I was hoping for the same with updated visuals. At first i was pleased with graphics and then i realized that gameplay is utter garbage. Huge downgrade. I was telling myself, its only because its newer game, but then i realized how broken and greedy system of getting new trains and upgrades of trains is. How is it even possible for company behind such a successful game as original Train Station put out something like this is beyond my understanding.",
      "starts out strong, but the flaws become obvious in the second region - that's where the game gets tedious (especially when there are events). feedback (via support system or forums) is ignored. a very few balancing changes would dramatically improve this game: set up a shop to buy specific engines (once you've passed into a new region is practically impossible to get engines for the previous), and tone down the upgrade requirements (engines in the third area require exponential upgrade parts compared to the second, for example). another complaint is the ads. you can safely ignore the ads, there are none in-your-face, but the ad provider they've chosen for everything else is complete garbage. it's a gorgeous game, and a fun time pass, but the developers just aren't doing enough."

      "I'll be honest with you... The only reason I keep getting back to this game is because of my ports which are full of gold, because I need that gold for getting tiles, because I need those tiles to create an almost fully customizable rail network across Europe, for which I feel the need of rebuilding it from scratch more and more, as I continue playing it. It's addictive.. extra for rail enthusiasts, like me, extra for those with a bit of ocd /with a passion for keeping things neat and tidy.",
      "This game is cool but it's very very very very hard to expand. I need iron tracks and all it ever gives me is wood. Come on man, don't make it so difficult. Because basically you can't expand unless you play for a hella long time, collect all the wood tracks you get, turn around and take 5 wooden tracks and turn it into ONE iron track or if you purchase tracks at a really high price WHICH I'VE ALREADY DONE TWICE. It's just another money hungry app. This game is pointless",
      "This app deserves five stars it's a super game with lots of possibilities however I have marked it with two stars because a couple of inapp purchases didn't register and I didn't get a refund nor a response when I contacted feedback or support. Gave me the feeling I didn't count and made me wonder if that had happened to any one else - ashame customer service should be better.",
      "I have been playing the game now for a few months and while the game is fun and enjoyable eventually it becomes painfully annoying.. You will never get a left hand alloy turn so some of the stations will be impossible to connect to. The prices for the alloy tiles to buy is ridiculously priced. The developers have it finely tuned that the game becomes impossible without thrown some cash their way.",
      "This game is nice and relaxing for you don't have to think to much and love how the game keeps the law of motion. The game would be a lot better though, if we could play this game offline! I don't have a choice to play either on or offline and I personally think thats wrong. I have no interest in watching an ad just to up the games money, so having the internet connection is pointless for someone like myself. If possible could you please change this so people can play this game offline?"

      "Best train game on the planet. I've gotten hours of enjoyment out of playing this game. I've spent a little real money on this game on some of the limited edition care packages, but it's not required for game play at all. And in fact, you can earn all the coins and gems you need by watching ads. So upgrading cars and engines and cabooses can be done entirely through game play and watching ads. If you love trains, you gotta try Tiny Rails.",
      "It sucks that this game is basically pay to progress. Yeah, one can wait for hours to get enough gems or a free roll to possibly get a train car that they already have to level up. If not, you gotta wait longer. If the story missions didn't require a certain level to progress, it would be a lot more entertaining but oh well.",
      "It's a great game! I absolutely love the pixel-like graphics. I got to say this game is one of if not my absolute top favourite game, and I have a lot of games so that's kinda sayin' something. I have to say though I think my game is a bit glitchy in the sense of I can leave the game for 3 hours and it will say something like traveled 1 or 2 miles even though I'm going 104miles a hour. And yet I can leave my game for 1 hour and it travels 135 Station and go from the edge of Europe east to Canad",
      "I love this game, it is so much fun and when there were some glitches they gave everyone free diamonds, this game is very relaxing and nice. I have only one complaint, sometimes the backgrounds are messed up, they glitch through themselves and sometimes the ocean just stops suddenly and it ruins my immersion. Other than that, fantastic!",
      "This cute fun game is actually pretty entertaining! I love customising my train and watching the mismatched parts travel the beautiful landscapes in this game. Even the \"premium\" currency (gems) is super easy to get for free. I have quite a few engines and cabooses, and I didn't spend a penny. Also, the devs are amazing. There was a bug that a few players experienced (me not included), and they a.) Fixed the bug and b.) gave EVERY player 150 gems. Great game, would recommend."

      "I played this game for the FIRST time and said to myself \"how do u make a train\" and I'm 8,sure u could choose a pre-built train but that's boring.Also someone wrote a review saying they were ten and about coal cars and u replyed this game is for kids and ads aren't for kids THEIR TEN your the kid here I read your review and what u say is more stupid than stupidly stupid",
      "The game is fun! But I Have no money on my account. So I can't get the full game. 😣 This Game Is Awesome 👌 But I wish I had money on my account! At first, I rated it as a 3, But since I love this game, I decided it is great and awesome! So now, I rated it as a 5! 😃",
      "This is a great game with lots of playability for children and adults. It has accurate peices to build your own train that work well and trains are easy to assemble. However after eight trial runs on level 1 you are no longer to run trains anymore luckily you are still able to build trains but not run them. I understand you need money but I and many other people do not have access to credit cards or gift cards or any other method of online payment could please try and make just level 1 free.",
      "It's a fun game and I like how you can create your own type of train and run it around. Although, the fact that you only get a limited amount of tries on 1 level is really annoying. It doesn't let people play whenever they want. If I had it my way, I would have 2-3 free levels and people have unlimited tries on all levels. If you could add these or at least remove the \"remaining tries\" on the free level, it would make me smile and more people would download your app.",

      "Pretty good game. It's a kids version of train sim by Bytes 3583 l believe. When you pull the scroller thing up it goes to like 140 mph and crashes. In train sim it goes to the trains top speed.",
      "Very educational but would be better if it had more features from train SIM.",
      "This thing is terrible. It pops ads in children's faces and then my son tried to press x, and the button is tiny and took him to play store. Plus it makes you buy things and the area keeps repeating itself after 20 seconds. And also when there are no stops, what do you do on the game? One tiny stop and there is no passengers or any thing else. All you do is stop and sit there doing nothing. How is it a simulator? And in a tiny crash, it freaks out a 4 year old like the crash will kill everyone. 0",
      "a fun and addictive game. very easy to play. but what I enjoy, is that the ease of play gives me the enjoyment of looking at the finely detailed images and background.",

It just keeps going in the background. Might want to fix that.",

But then there's another ongoing sound with the music switch too. You will hear the same sound loop over and over, this is a new thing. But i hope this bug will eventually get fixed. Thank you for your support.",
      "I like train station. Some of it seems rather simple, other activities can take all the planning and detail you can bring to bear on them. Planning and using your stockpiles of materials is not a simple matter. You have more than 20 materials plus people and mail your transporting in and out. The detail involved in more than 15 international stations and the variety of needs to accomplish can vary considerably from stockpiling materials for projects to buying and selling items for construction projects at remote stations. I keep a notepad handy as the details can change rapidly. It's not necessary to do your best but it can improve your performance or at least it seems like it improves mine. I like detail I'm having fun.Unfortunately the need for more powerful engines can end up costing real money. Still it is a fun game...………..",
      "Been playing this game for several years now. Started on facebook around 2012 or so and moved over to the app after getting out of basic and getting a phone. Never had a major problem with it and dont expect to in the future. For small things or general questions that have cropped up during all this time, their customer service remains as impeccable as it was the day I started. I look forward to playing for years to come!",
      "This game is ok. I do like the concept very much like the way this game is put together. Needs some twicking otherwise good game The thought behind this game is good. I just wish that when your waiting for your mail to fill up to send the trains to there destinations that instead of balloons with coins maybe all mail balloons so that you can send the trains a bit quicker. also when there selling trains they keep sending one they want to sell you. If I wanted to buy one I would ."

      "The game is good, and it's pretty darn easy to recognize. I would rate 5 stars, but I can't. There's a few issues I have with the game that prevents me from rating 4 stars. First, sometimes the points icon will disappear for no reason, preventing you from changing tracks. Second, the Vl65's cab view details are very blurry. Third, the Class 66 makes no sound. Fourth, the STC-44 doesn't show up when you go to select your train. And finally, the 81-760's cab view is broken.",
      "Cool game and great concept ,but what were you guys smoking when making these controls? The game is almost unplayable. You guys seriously need to take this in consideration and fix it because that is your main complaints with everyone is the controls ,so obviously there's a problem here. Has any one of you developers even played the game?",
      "really great but its basically unplayable because of the movement system and building. the prop selection is ok, no n ed to change that. but there was another game exactly like this(but it was a buck or 2) and you could click different buttons to move and build stuff. whenever i do the double finger to move it places a building. please fix this",
      "fun train game so make the cars i place move by themselves but the rest of them should stay in place, boats to place on water, and 2 planes can take off from runway forever. so, make that update it will make this train game more fun. oh! and don't forget to add the weather type: storm. and more trains and more new items to place.",
      "Nice graphics and a lot of trains to choose from but I cannot rate this 5 cuz it's hard to control and I can't place new rails."

The game is so relaxing to play and you get a generous playing area on which to build your tracks and buildings. Ride in the cab or view all the trains from above. It's a model railway enthusiasts dream :) Thank you Train Go !",

Also, this station can't be elevated. The regular can be elevated after purchasing the elevated station but this one cannot.",

      "Like many of these types of games, you need to have serious patience at first. But, once you have played consistently for a while, and learned the best ways to structure railroads and progress, the game really speeds up and gets fun. At level 19 I have more than 20 railroads spanning 3 continents, and in just a few hours of play can quickly save up hundreds of thousands of in game coins. If you decide to stick it out, make sure to check out the wiki and the subreddit for tips! 10/10 great game.",
      "I like the game a lot, enough that I'm making a review even though I never make them. Since the last update though, it has become unplayable for me. At first I just wasn't able to see the jobs for each train, and therefore be able to send them out on jobs. So when I saw that there was a resent update I figured that it was a conflict caused by that, so I uninstalled the app and downloaded it again. When I opened it up after that I was nothing but a black screen that wouldn't load farther.",
      "Hope this update FIXES the game. Don't know how they could have released the last one (verion 1.3.7) - LOST ALL MY RAILROADS, only engines, improved yards, & not enough game currency remaind to find out if the game was playable! Looked up the developer's address - in USA - though it would be in some part of the world were they would need vast sums of money or be trying to convert the games to online only. WELL I'LL HAVE TO UPDATE BECAUSE THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS TO UNINSTALL.",
      "After the latest update, the game is LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE! In fact, I cannot find it in my apps!The cute icon featuring a pixelised steamer engine is nowhere to be seen, send help! Curiously enough, the latest Android update seems to have forced an installation of an app previously unknown to me. Its icon is a white blue train on a white blue background. Man... technology these days...",
      "I found a bug. It wont let me pick up jobs and move my trains to different station because of it. It's just stuck to the station i left my trains to refuel. Too bad been playing this for quite a some time but still restarting my progress coz there's no cloud save. Im expecting to finally finish and complete this game once and for all but then this bug stopped me from playing. Wont play it until update and fixed. Hope that someday Pocket Planes will be back for android. ALL MY LINES ARE STUCK"

This is a great game to download if you want something that is a bit challenging, but fun at the same time. One thing I would suggest adding, though: an American train. The Amtrak Acella would be a good choice, I think. Anyways, thanks Northplay for making such great games. Keep up the good work.",
      "Suggestion An awesome game. Having fun totally. The only suggestion I would like to give is regarding the color of the passengers/stations. There is a shade of purple and blue which is difficult to recognise for the color blind persons like me. I would request the developers to change the colors to some other dark color which will help us to recognize the colors better. Overall a great time killer",
      "Update: continuous mode is here plus other new features. Here's my 5 stars as promised. :) Great game. I'm going back through at the moment to get 3 stars on every level. Needs a continuous mode, maybe add building difficulty as time progresses. I'll give 5 stars if you can add continuous mode",
      "Owsum levels, tricky and challenging but not impossible, the developers are too good at keeping the ads at, tolerable level, and playable. Kudos to developers team❤️❤️",
      "Fun game. However, I noticed that while on the first few levels of the game, the online subscription was $2.99. Was happy to consider subscribing, but upon playing a few more levels and assume closer to the end of the game (trial?) the subscription cost increased to $4.99. Hope this was a genuine price change rather than an increase because i was more inclined to purchase being closer to the finish."

      "Pretty fun game, few issues, advanced braking does nothing, waste of coins, buying the other steam locomotive, waste of 12 gems, I had 12, tried to buy it, then it says I don't have enough gems and still takes them bringing me down to 0 gems, and after buying the 4 stops permit, it still is only showing 2 stops, but if you look around that the game is pretty fun.",
      "Finally. A game with NO ADVERTS. Other games have more adverts than Sky Sports but this game has precisely none. But please add other mainlines like the WCML, CML, GWML etc instead of just having the ECML. More Trains instead of just a black version of the Flying Scotsman and the other steam train. Can you add the LNER Azuma, Virgin Trains 390, West Midlands Railway 323 and some proper Freight trains like 66s, 70s etc. Good game anyway but only 3 stars.",
      "This game is very classic and it gives a real feel to drive a steam engine",
      "Can you fix a bug where in the side rods doesnt move whenever the train starts. Also can you add more trains because that would be fun. Great game"

And maybe some different environments. The possibilities are really endless. The game itself is a fun little time passer. Controls are simple and the upgrade system is perfect.

      "So far have had a good amount of fun with this subway sim although that last part after the last stop doesn't really clue you in that you're approaching the end of the line--then crash right into the wall. Other than that, solid. If you're looking for suggestions for new rolling stock to add, may I recommend adding the R40 Slants from the NYC Subway?",
      "This game is very stupid, I've been trying to get the the other side of the first map, but for some reason, I had to restart because I got \"3 citations\" but I did not do anything worng, I kept on trying to stop at the stops, but for some reason, if I only go a couple of sena meters, it counts as me going past it, not my favorite game, at all! Edit: I got to the end, but for some reason, I softly tapped the end, and it counted as if I crashed into it on pompous, I had this as 2 stars but now a 1",
      "It's a great game, but for some reason on some of the train routes other trains ahead of you seem to stop and not move, which means you can't finish the route as you'd go through a red signal. Other than that on the routes you can complete its pretty good",
      "It's decent but you have to pay for a LOT of things so please make it so you don't have to pay and also the brakes don't really work the best . it still keeps going and even if I'm 1 meter of it still says I failed.",
      "I thought this game was free to play it's not u have to pay 74.95$ just to freaking play this game!!! TOTALLY RIPPED OFF!!! This should had been on paying downloads not free people get real Should been free because it'd on steam for 14.99$ not paying for the game on phone Its ridiculous"

      "it's a 5 minute wonder. It's not a game as such because there's no start, no end, and no goals. Can have only 7 trains.. put in an 8th and it deletes the 1st. Making a complete loop of track is not seamless. The best way to describe this app is, it's moving wallpaper with sound. This app has a lot of potential, and possibly has been used in a more complex \"game\", but this one is, like, a first two step stage, 1) Design. 2) Bugless program. Uninstalling to make room for an actual game.",

      "I Love it its very great and better than the other ones but i wish we could pick the train to go on the track",
      "Look, for those of u calling this a boring, simple, moving wallpaper app rather than a game, maybe u should develop a train game app that challenges minds like urs and leave this one to the children who are having fun playing this game.",

      "I have a problem with this game. It will not let me get any game by I'm betting it's probably going to be a one-star anyways for me because I am a big train Game Fan I played a lot of train games. So we have a problem with this game. So this game needs to be updated. And you need to fix that problem immediately. Or I'll delete my review and delete the one star that I pushed out to your game.",
      "You really need to fix it so the trains run ON the tracks! Overall I like the concept of the game. Also when coming to a stop you should be able to stop AT the red line. Please address these issues with your next update. Thank you.",
      "The game is awesome. There are many upgrades for your yard. The only thing like is that there aren't many train horns but thats okay.",
      "Simple but appealing train game. Chicago Train is the next evolution but by no means renders American Diesel Trains obsolete. Not a money grab either. Had to knock off a star for the annoying bug where the wrong map pops up, wiping out previous train orders. Also, the contracts - can't see how you finish one without playing 24 hours straight. Game does get repetitive: buy new yard, expand, buy another, etc.",
      "Honestly, i was beginning to like this game, the grinding wasnt to bad, but then i use the coin booster i get up to around 31,000 coins, feeling goos, and then next screen im at 20,000 coins...im pissed, im not going to grind or play only to have my money taken away for no reasonb im uninstalling and im pretty pissed."

      "Had to start from scratch so many times! Ridiculous! If you don't lay out EVERYTHING PERFECTLY the first time, after you set your train to start running, you'll have to start the challenge over! So if you see something that is wrong or can be tweaked to be more efficient, you can't change track layout (nothing major, just a tweek!) or change order of stops! It's super evident once you get to Barcelona. Stop lights are a joke. Loading track at each destination is a joke. Common sense people!",
      "Fun puzzles, and decent graphics for a handheld. You can lay down track where you want, which puts this above most other mobile train games. But...no Freeplay/sandbox, and you can't keep playing a map after meeting the objectives. Thus, after playing through the 20 or so maps (45 minutes each?), you're done. Can go back and replay, but that's it. Add sandbox, and it would be a 5-star. Fun while it lasts, but not much replayability.",
      "This game is great! It plays very much like \"Sid Meyers Railroads!\" with the exception that you play against a list of objectives rather than AI players. The controls have been streamlined for mobile very well and there are tons of levels to play through.",
      "Good, well developed game. Has some pay to win elements though. Its pretty much impossible without using hats. You get hats for completing missions or you can buy them with real cash. You will probably want to grind the Japan mission for Hats to the point where it's no longer fun. For improvement please allow refunds when selling trains and buying a locomotive and then canceling it, this includes Hats. Thanks. Update...Not worth it. To much pay to win or grind previous missions for hats.",
      "Going to be honest here. I paid the $$$ requested for some in-game currency... I just wanted to be able to get one or two needed trains. I never thought the game was pay per play. As you progress, it becomes obvious that you cant complete the tasks without using real $$$. It defeats the purpose of the game. So yes, I am giving one star."

      "Really good game when it worked, BUT, now i have no tracks or track pieces. Looks like level 2813 is the end of the line. Customer service doesnt exist, get automated \"we will get back to you\" still waiting for a reply… many many months later, STILL waiting for customer \"service\"",

      "Very simple game. Little reward for progress really the points dont matter. Repetative after a while, seems like it repeats the same levels over and over.",
      "Was great game early. No upgrade to train rolling stock after about level 100. I'm on level 845 now but maybe uninstall after level 1000 if not able to update my train.",
      "It's funny but every time I have a problem and the train stops and I contact customer service your agents take care of the problem. I gave this 5 stars all around, because of color soundtrack and animation. Respectfully RLD"

      "Pretty good game slow to start but not to hard, not to easy. Over all, its a pleasant game. People there is nice and friendly, support is awesome if you have questions or concerns they are there on top of things. Id recommend this game. Mini game controls are to small the joy stick and fire button. Over all great game.",
      "I enjoy the game . I like how it is realistic and fun. I think it is neat how the game map uses Google maps which makes it a more realistic game. Only thing is when you pay for no ads their is still ads in the game. Also think it would be nice to be able to speed the ships up like you do with the trains otherwise a great game to pass the time with.",
      "Theres lots of features in this game that unlock at certain levels, would be great to no these exist when you first play the game. Really addictive and would recommend. I would happily pay for this game but the prices for packs and items are well overpriced. Still has a few issues, sometimes the touchscreen capability stops working and I have to reset the game. Better tutorial, less features on the screen, theres too many, trains listed on order off when there due back.",
      "Very enjoyable so far. Easy to work out and advances enough so you don't get bored. I like the jobs are on a real map. I will be playing it for some time yet I hope. Kinda addicted!",
      "Just purchased for 5,000,000 coins and never got them. Even restarted my phone. Now I'm out $16.99... within 15min of this post it was fixed immediately. Thanks for the speedy help. This game is pretty good. Definitely keeps me occupied"

      "It's great. But it doesn't seem to work anymore. It's stuck in the loading screen. Edit: Tried reinstalling several times, restarting my phone, clearing memory etc. , didn't work. The next day worked just fine without any changes. Anyway it's a really fun app, I am enjoying this kind of connectivity in toys.",
      "As a companion tool to the train set it is amazing, albeit made worse by the recent updates (manual water refill button is now available only in \"No Activities\" mode which is dumb, my kid likes BOTH refilling the tank at will AND the prompts from the command blocks). As a set of minigames it's... Now that you're letting us play them on demand without the command blocks, why not give them longer play modes? (Finally, I need an app reset button because we found all the stickers and my kid is sad)",
      "Excellent. A dream come true. I used to want a train where I could control. 25years later, I have it for my son. You can control the train and have a mini game. I don't allow my son to use phones but this is an exception as the phone control is like a remote control for the train. Highly interactive! In Lego I trust",
      "The app works fine but after the 2nd day there is no sound coming from the actual engine. Everything else works fine. Very disappointed as my son loves the train. If there is a quick solution please let me know. Thank you. Update: 3/2/20 Got a replacement for the faulty engine. Thank you.",
      "I got this train 925 to my kid but doesn't work. My phone sees the train in Bluetooth but somehow doesn't connect to it. I have cat s52 phone... Please help. I tried reinstalling the app but with no worth. P.s. thanks for your response. You should describe this in the games prospect's. It's amazing. My kid loves it very much."

      "The game itself has no actual scenarios (like red lights or derailment or coupling with other trains etc.). All you get is a few basic controls (like lights and and acceleration and braking lever). The time (in the game) is inconsistent and jumps up and down in random intervals if you want a real train simulator to enjoy what a real life train driver would experience, this will not give you that. So I would advise sticking to the pc Train Simulators by steam. This is great for unrealistic play.",
      "Hey guys, very nice game but in Custom mode, when it comes to a switch in direction (eg. At Stuttgart Station) or any point between stations where the game has to load, the game refuses to finish loading and instead hangs after reaching 100% loading. Can you please fix this issue? It disrupts what is otherwise a very good gaming experience. Thanks!",
      "I'm pleased to say that after the latest update this game now runs smoothly and perfectly on Android 10 even with the graphics set to ultra. If you like trains or trains SIMs you'll love this game.",
      "You have to pay to make progress unless you have around 30 dollars or so, DONT GET THIS GAME.",
      "In the bonus chapter called \"Complete Germany\", level 10 refuses to load for me and the sim gets stuck on a frozen screen, forcing me to restart every single time. So I have skipped that chapter until the issue is fixed and I'll continue playing the other chapters for now! Side note: I got the entire bonus steam engine built and it's pretty cool. I hope to see more classic engines like that added in future updates. 🌞"

My favorites are the NW Y6A, Class A1 Berkshire, Class A3 peppercorn, GP9, Big boy, LMS Corination,and etc. The only flaw is the fact that Daylight moves slow. Also i think you should add whistles and horns to the locomotives(Accurate horns/whistles please.) Thank you so much for this game and putting the names of the locomotives.The little ones will learn their train types!",
      "First, it is not a idle game. It needs a lot of activeness.",
      "Updated: Score decreased. I have now lost approximately 450 gems just by swiping through screens. Review - It needs more. Simple as that. As with all PF games there is a glass ceiling you hit at higher level and this is no different than Seaport or Train station. The city is too limited and needs more variety, cars, things happening. You cannot customise the city. The trains and car models never change and all repeat. There are not enough trains in the game or variation say in liveries.",

      "Seems ok so far. Barely started playing this game, so want to se how I like it. Run out of tickets quickly, can only play a few minutes at a time before have to quit. Not very fun that way. Who wants to watch videos, when it's more fun to play? Never have more than 4-5 tickets to play. And I will never pay to play, pretty sure I'm not the only one feels this way. Thought I would try game a second time to see if there were any changes. Still boring to only be able to play few minutes each time.",

Place the dynamite on different places and blow up the bridge at the right time. You are on a mission to stop the train. You must grab your bag of dynamite and place them on the bridges to make it explode. Then sit back and watch the show! Be sure to place the dynamite in a good place and not run out.\r\n\r\nIf you need a break of everything and everyone around you, go and set your anger free with this cool Dynamite Train game. Play an awesome game and complete all levels. The smile will come back on your face in no time. Place the dynamites on the bridges and make the train fall into the hollow to earn some points. For extra points and bonuses you will have to do this very fast and thus earn a higher time bonus. The aim of the game is to unlock all 24 levels, which are your challenge. Roll your mouse over the screen to see the image from another view or use the plus and minus icons to zoom in/ out. There are four different types of dynamites that can be attached and used to destroy either wood, steel, ropes or stones. At the top of your screen are several indicators. Between them are the dynamites that are available in a certain order. Click on an appropriate part of the bridge and continue with the next dynamite. You can replace dynamite simply by clicking it again and drag it where you want. When you place all dynamites click the Play button (on the upper right corner) to start the bridge. Then click the detonator to blow up the bridge and destroy the train. Wish you good luck with your total score. \r\n\r\nYou are on a mission to stop the train.

      "This game is not so bad, and not so good. Why? Graphic was good engines fine coaches, freights, but why the cc201 locomotive was full in a pink color?and the eksekutif new livery coach was started from eating car, then passenger coach, the carriage car. What? Why did the developer not start the coach from passenger coach, the eating car, and carriage car? Please fix this bug!!!!!!"

It's easy to learn but very tough to master. Your job is simple: get each train to a goal station. Red trains go to red stations, blue trains go to blue stations, etc. You control the trains by drawing track for them to follow. There isn't a time limit or even a score; the only thing you need to do is figure out a solution for each puzzle.\r\n\r\nTrainyard Express Features:\r\n+ Innovative and challenging puzzle mechanic\r\n+ Smooth difficulty curve\r\n+ Over 60 fantastic puzzles\r\n+ Hundreds of ways to solve each puzzle\r\n+ Solutions can be found on Trainyard.ca\r\n+ Looks GREAT on tablets!\r\n+ Engineered for low battery usage\r\n+ Colour-blind mode\r\n+ A year in the making\r\n+ Developed in one person's spare time(support indie games!)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first few puzzles are almost too easy, but as the difficulty increases you'll be thankful that you were able to practice the fundamentals of drawing track. As the game progresses, you'll have to use basic colour theory to combine trains of different colours, use timing to merge, and use every inch of your brain in your quest to beat the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the difference between Trainyard and Express? In the full game there are more than 100 more puzzles!\r\n\r\nThe full game also has splitter pieces, which are AWESOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStuck on a puzzle?

      "I played this game alot when it first came out on iOS about 10 years ago, the puzzles and gameplay were simple, challenging and the feeling of accomplishment when you solved some of those crazy last levels were worth it. The developer abandoned it, and having completed it I left it alone. When I found it on the Google Play store I had to have it, so I bought it, I had to pay. It was great to play all over again. Since then it is now free and contains ads everywhere. Ive had to remove it.",
      "Often can't get two tracks to match up at certain points which is annoying.",
      "Get a bigger screen they said I now know why, so they can bombard you with more ads Really disappointing this used to be my favorite game. Not it's a ad wall cash cow for some urethra whom added it there. Can't even pay to remove it just a giant waist of screen space",
      "This game was challenging in all the right ways. Gameplay was great. It doesn't trigger the casino tendencies a lot of games do. I could put it down when real life demanded I not have my nose in my phone, but I was always excited to play again. After uninstalling 5 games in a row because they were more vehicles for ads than actual games, it was nice to play one that, while it had ads, they were not invasive at all. I'd happily pay for more levels. Great game!",
      "They have removed trainyard and now there's only this annoying one with lots of ads. I hate ads, so uninstalling..."

      "Fun, different a good way to waste time. I mean this a good way. Although I got the wrong game, I meant to download rail maze two. That game is a five star game it let's you use your brain. All in all I've never played a game from spooky that wasn't enjoying and fun. Keep up the good work.",
      "Way, way, way too many ads. And don't even get me started on the tickets! I watch an ad, get some tickets, (not to mention the ads they play randomly) and before you know it, you are out of tickets. Makes it very difficult to get into the game.",
      "Too much advertising. More time spent watching ads than playing.",
      "Everything is amazing and I also played in my blackberry tablet when I was little and it was the best but now the tickets are really annoying and tickets were not a thing when I played this in my blackberry tablet",
      "I remembered loving this game as a kid years ago, thought I'd re-install it to see if it's fun as I remember, so I'm blazing through the first levels and it's all coming back to me, this really is quite fun, and then BAM! I have to wait TWENTY MINUTES to play ONE more level because apparently the only feature the people behind this added after years is a ticket system to ruin what would otherwise be an excellent and charming game"
