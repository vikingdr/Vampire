      "Terrible. Chat never available. Cancel feature broken. Called multiple times to hear a recording that the service was not available. When I finally got through, the agent uttered I was being unresponsive and quickly hung up while I was talking. She literally gave me 1 second to reply while on hold for over 2 hours. Now I'm stranded outside the country in this crisis because the airline canceled a flight and put me on a connection before the first flight. I'm not a time traveler. Thanks Expedia!",
      "This app sucks, how did it get 4.5 stars? You will NOT GET ANY REFUND if you cancel a flight. You will only get CREDITS can only be redeemed by calling them. You cannot use your credits on the app!!! And they have some technical issues so you cannot call them to book a flight. So your refund money is gone. The app sucks.",
      "DO NOT BOOK TRAVEL WITH THIS APP!!! Due to covid19, we had flights booked. The airline canceled our flights but cannot refund us because we booked with Expedia. Expedia's robotic call system will not allow us to speak to an agent and there is STILL no option on the app for a refund. We are trapped in a foreign country as they have our money and we cannot book another flight. We are not the only ones. UPDATE: Your reply matches Expedia's Mar 12 email, but nothing has changed with ref to refunds.",
      "I found the travel insurance that is offered to be useless in the face of a real emergency. I purchased my trip long before the COVID virus was announced. I am outraged that the travel insurance company was allowed to add a bunch of exclusions concerning COVID-19 long after my purchase. AIG altered the policy to avoid paying out. In my opinion, the insurance offered is a scam.",

      "I love the Travel Channel, but for this app if you want to watch anything new, you must be paying a provider to see it. Some of us got sick and tired of paying someone else to watch channels that are then cancelled, or the provider does a price hike. I personally just got tired of paying more for less and unplugged from them all. I can't afford less for more, as I'm now disabled, with other health issues I have to pay for, so I resorted back to an antenna that's free.",
      "I love this app I can take some of my favorite shows like ghost adventures anywhere but what I'd really like is to have the ability to watch ads for locked content like a certain amount like 10 ads to watch this episode on top of the ones already shown during the show anyway I think this would boost your profits and amount of people who download the app and if you could rotate the free seasons every month that would be really cool",
      "I have not been able to use the app for about 2 weeks now. I thought it was due to the update that my phone, Samsung Galaxy S10, did an update but every other tv app(netflix, hulu, disney+, etc...) work just fine along with everything else. Judging by all of the reviews I'm seeing here, it looks like the problem is the app itself. I have cleared all of the system cache, the app cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice and it still does not work. I have also already submitted a help request as well. Since other people are having the very same issue with the app, why not just say 'we are looking into the problem' or 'we are aware there may be a problem and are trying to pin point the issue'",
      "App is flat out not loading after the Galaxy s10+ update. And no, clearing the cache does not fix it. Things that also do not fix it: uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting the phone, etc. This is disappointing considering Travel Channel is awesome, but I guess I'll just have to go outside and experience life beyond my phone. Please don't make me do that. I'd rather watch it through this app. Just fix it. Thank you.",
      "This app does what it's supposed to do, it plays travel channel shows. The problem is though, the shows are not in the order that they came out, they're all jumbled up, and it doesn't keep track of the shows that you watched. Also there are so many dang commercials. I cannot believe the amount of commercials that are on here. I specifically got this app just so I can watch ghost adventures and the lineup is completely screwed it up and the commercials are unbelievable."

      "Save your time from using this app, and using priceline. I have booked a hotel with priceline. Chat and called because I could not make it to my reservation due to the quarantine, and both hotels and priceline declined my refund. Not only that, the representative for Priceline stated that I would receive a call in 15 mins. 45 minutes has passed by, and no call. Please reframe from using this application and Priceline in general. They are a rip off, and only about the company policy. Unbelievable",
      "This app seems more for buying a new trip then tracking one. I love priceline and all the people in custermer support, the deals, updates in the email but the app is not geered for that service. It seems to really want bew business. I am un installing it.",
      "There were a few problems I experienced while trying to book this same room for a second night. But I think its because I am not familiar with doing things for myself eith today's technology. But I think \"Yeah, I Got This\" now. It's great yo know one can save so much time and money with such ease!!",
      "I used like 5 different apps back and forth trying to find a decent flight, and this one ended up being not only the easiest, but definitely the cheapest. Doesn't direct you to another site to book, and you individually choose departure and return flight. Super helpful and informative.",
      "It's great except using it for flight. The date of birth is not the most efficient. Scrolling several pages to get to my birth year was ridiculous. At the end, it kept the correct month and date but stayed with 1990. I tried three times. It needs to be fixed. Other apps use easier ways to get dob."

      "This is an awesome app!! I was able to save restaurants, bars, shopping mall, museums, and free thing to do for my trips this year. This is a great app for traveling abroad. Especislly since you can save articles, pictures of locations, and get good deals. I just wish that I was able to do the same for traveling in the states. I was able to save articles but the articles did not have pictures of the restaurants. I would like to see listings of restaurants and be able to save that restaurant.",
      "It's simply amazing. Used their website for a while, now discovered the app. Been helpful for Vietnam and Cambodia so far, I'm sure it doesn't end there. Improvement ideas: allow to copy the address, that way I'd be able to quickly past it to the ride hauling app (or better yet, integrate buttons for the ride hauling apps installed - if that's technically feasible)",
      "Incredible, interesting, easy to use content. Culture trip have never let me down on any trip worldwide. There research has always been accurate in my experience and I find it very easy to use especially for short trips where you need to cram in as much of the good stuff as possible, this app has saved me time.",
      "This app is absolutely amazing, every information is there and all really well written, it's one must to have app if you like to travel, less than 5 starts would be a crime for such a good app.",
      "Tried a London Art Nouveau walk yesterday. It was helpful but a little sparse and some buildings were more or less interesting. Plus some long walks between them, where perhaps links to City Mapper might help."

      "Mostly awesome...I just wish the menu was easier to navigate. For example, when I open the app and I have a flight THAT DAY, it should be the first thing I see (i.e. You have a flight today! Here's the details etc) instead of having to look all over the app for my confirmation number when I'm at the airline kiosk. Other than this, it's a stellar booking app",
      "This app is good for monitoring flights but if they want more people to use it to actually book their flights, they have ALOT of work to do. Customer service is terrible. If something changes with your flight and you need to talk to someone, GOOD LUCK. Response times take weeks and theres no actual phone number you can call to talk to someone. They need to hire more staff to manage the large chat volumes, or get an actual call center. I will never be using the app again to book my flights.",
      "There app charges double / doesn't find the best deal. Booked montreal to Miami for May and app said $500 was good and to book. When I did a simple Google search, I found the EXACT same flight for half the price. I thought Hopper was supposed to give us the best deals, I guess not. Last time I'll be using the app to book a flight.",
      "I also use Google's tracker & find it more reliable since it'll email me almost everyday when prices have changed. So to my surprise when Google told me the lowest price, I was disappointed that hopper didn't send me notifications. I had to open the app to find out they also agreed it was the lowest time to buy. Another unfortunate thing is that they don't have an option for which class u want, unlike Google. I still have this app around to compare prices, but didn't use it to buy our flights",
      "Nothing but confusion. I booked my trip a week ago and have had minimal communication. Trying to contact customer support is near impossible. They have no telephone numbers. Currently experiencing a full on nightmare trying to book a trip. 0/10 do not book with this app. Should have went with Expedia my God."

      "Bad app. Useless when traveling. It should have a map like Google maps with all places indicated, filter something and only appear that in the map. The system only allows you to download like cities, but for example when traveling to Bali, we wanted to search places in general, but you can't, you must know in which \" city\" that place is to find it, and normally you don't know that why you are searching. So the best thing would be to have all places for countries or regions, and have a search box",
      "Wow. Used to be great. But now they're charging 5 bucks (4 pounds) to TEMPORARILY ACCESS guidebooks for a month. For anyone reading this, don't throw money out the window! You can buy ANY used guidebook for that price and its yours too keep 😊 alternatively, use a library! Lonely planet, you did have the option to price fairly, but you didn't. Don't @ me.",
      "I used to love this app - it was easy to use, had lots of information, and helped me plan for a number of trips. Now it's a paid-for subscription service, I'll be uninstalling as its no longer fit for purpose for me - the costs aren't worth the amount I use it (despite Lonely Planet's copy and pasted response to all of the other comments that are the same as mine). There are a number of other free resources (which funnily enough includes LP's own website) that I'll continue to use instead.",
      "The app is now not useful at all, since they implemented new ridiculous subscriptions (way overpriced). I'm very disappointed about Lonely Planet. I will not pay that price for subscription, doesn't matter which reason they give. If nothing change I will simply delete the app. We are in 2020, we can find a lot of travel information on the web without having to pay for. It was a great app, before...",

      "Spent over 3 hours on hold just to get hung up on. That has happened several time's now! Dont waist money on the waiver it's a gimmick and you're just spending money to lose your money. I was told this app was garbage but didn't listen. Lesson learned!! Hopefully nobody else has to go through this. Book airlines and hotels on your own through Google and save the headache",
      "Booking was easy. Good luck with customer support. I've been trying to call for 2 days now with no response. I can't even get a hold of a real person and the AI support just keeps sending me on a loop so I can't cancel my flight. Once this trip is settled I'm never using this again",
      "Incredibly frustrating to try and cancel a reservation using this app. In fact, it was actually impossible for me. I ended up having to cancel the hotel and the flight individually with the providers. I have since deleted and uninstalled this application and will never use Travelocity again in my life. What a joke.",
      "Booked hotel for 3 days, due to weather, needed to cancel one night, but app only allowed total cancellation, could not contact Travelocity by phone to cancel just 1 day due to \"technical difficulties\" on their end. Contacted hotel to cancel 1 day, but hotel said they would do it but couldn't due to it being booked through Travelocity. After trying for 3 hrs to contact representative had to cancel through app costing me $200.00. I missed cancellation mark by one hour. Thx Travelocity for nothing",
      "Would NOT recommend using this company! When I went to book one hotel room, the site told me that it had timed out and not went through, so naturally I did it again. I ended up being charged for 2 rooms and have been trying for days to get ahold of them to get refunded , with no luck yet. The phone lines always say \"we are having technical difficulties, please call again later\", no response from FB messenger, or email either. I just want my money back from my unused hotel room.."

      "Skyscanner used to be great. Now it's very slow. Also if I search for fights with 2 adults and 2 children to somewhere that is not a listed destination, it then goes to a new screen where I have to select flights, again, and it forgets that is for 2 adults and 2 children and finds flights for a single traveler. Even if you click on a selection you can't add note passengers and redo the search.",
      "So i have a new phone... When you first install the app, you don't get that screen on first use. You are offered the opportunity to set up an account (which i skipped) then you get a \"where do you want to go\" screen with no option to tap search, then flights. Only by closing the app and reopening does dialog as you describe it get presented. Maybe you need to rethink the after install use cases?",
      "Terrible app on a mobile phone, text overlapping and filtering is hard to navigate, especially when trying to look at monthly flights. Overall very poor in comparison to the actual website. The whole app GUI needs completely overhauled. Uninstalled & now using the website. Also, judging by other reviews, Skyscanner aren't listening to customers.",

    "comments":[
      "Updated - Needs a lot of work. It should provide boarding passes after they are sent to tripit. It doesn't let you enter your phone number from your phone (laptop works). Not even from desktop mode on phone because it does it \"automatically\". Except it doesn't. It also won't let you delete a single flight that it has in error. The app is okay at finding flights in email though. It couldn't see one leg of my trip, is there a maximum of 5 flights?",
      "Disappointing. Basic info shows up in one place, which is nice. No integration of frequent flyer or rewards memberships in trip content. Keeps losing email scan capabilities so I have to reset it every time. And now the option to reset it from the app setting has just disappeared. Right now I could type info on a plain document and get the exact same capabilities I am getting from tripit.",
      "Badly let down by the map functionality. Yes, you can plot points on a map but despite Tripit's claims, you cannot view the whole itinerary on a map. Going into map view displays itinerary points within the immediate vicinity of the start point but you can't view anything further afield. The app links into Google maps but normal zoom functionality (+/- buttons, pinch etc) is missing so it is not possible to zoom out. I could only see half my itinerary on the map. Pointless.",
      "App keeps freezing after editing trip and I have to lock my screen and then unlock just to be able to close the app. I wouldn't use it except for the fact it has the simplest and easiest way for the parents of 20 students to see the info on a trip abroad I'm organizing. Pain for me but provides the best way to view for them. I have a Samsung Note 10+. Just as a note, the web version appearance is unsightly and overly complicated. If it had the same kind of view as the app, I'd stick with that.",
      "The itinerary for the flight works decent. Now, the \"enter name\" for hotel location and car rental for example, it would be nice to have the cursor in the field already rather than having to touch the field. For the names and fields, please have the field auto-capitalize the first letter automatically :) Otherwise, the search feature works well only typing say the \"Hotel Name\" with street number generally pops up the information quickly. I think the overall UI for each section such as car rental, flights, etc can use more icons and colors. It looks a little bland. Overall functionality compared to other trip planner app seem to work well so giving it 4-stars. Looking forward to more improvements! Thanks :D"

      "On the surface this app looks great. I planned my itineraries, but didn't book anything with the app. However, once I got to my destination I found out almost all the information was wrong. It couldn't pinpoint my location (I have an international plan) and instead of informing me of that, it would just show me in a wrong location. I couldn't adjust it either. Then every single one of the times to get from place to place was wrong. This app ended up being a huge disappointment.",
      "Visit A City is an extremely useful app for trip planning. The #1 feature is its ability to automatically arrange stops by proximity to limit the extra walking back and forth. It allows you to make your own by highlighting what you want to see but also has suggest itineraries for a number of different days and styles.",
      "Make your experience visiting a new city organized and easy. You can be militant with your schedule, or as care free as you want. Customization is good. I would give it a 5 if through the customization it would also help optimize your walking path.",
      "I've been using this app for my trips. I really like the options they give you depending on the length of your stay. The idea of being able to change times and places is very smart.",
      "Very handy app! I've loved using it so far. The only thing I would say is when moving an activity from one day to a different day according to personal choice, it would be useful for the app to rearrange the other activities in terms of travel to and from it, as it does that in the first place, as I then struggled to rearrange the day to make most sense. Other than that, very useful app! Would recommend."

They can modify/delete my personal info. and trips. This does not occur if i am logged out. Major privacy issue.",

      "All of a sudden, the fight informaton is removed automatically. We don't know if they are canceled or not. If I rely on the information I entered for future reference, this will be disastrous as I can't find it anyone. I will look for another app since this behavior will get me surprised. I cannot trust this app anymore.",
      "Forwarding emails to trips@ doesn't work 4 out of 5 times. Also adding flights with only alphabetic characters works, but many flights also have digits in there (eg are alphanumeric and not alphabetic). I end up putting most of my itinerary in there manually. Oh and it looks like the app is from the nineties - very old design.",
      "I use this app for ever trip! Helps me see all things I want to do or see. Use information from past trips to plan future trips based on notes I entered. Love it. Will always use. Only wish there was a way to make that a day's plans have been confirmed completely.",
      "A nice app, very much like WorldMate. Unfortunately there is one BIG FAILING. The trips are all stored in cloud, rendering the app useless once traveling, unless you have roaming data or available WiFi. Such a big let down, as WorldMate stored all your trip details on your device. Why TripCase can't do the same is beyond me. A bid step backwards.",
      "Not impressed. The issues I had years ago still are there. Does not merge reservations automatically. When merging manually still is clunky and doesn't put things in the correct order (flights completely out of order timewise, hotels on wrong days, doubling of entries for not explicable reason you name it and no way to fix manually). One trip and not impressed."

      "I absolutely love how intuitive the app is, I bought the Pro version to get rid of the advertisements, and now I'm very happy. One note, however, I couldn't find a report function. Barrow, Alaska changed its name back to Utqiagvik, and I think it's troubling that there is no functionality to report this to the app developers. Please add this function to future updates, thank you.",
      "Very disappointed the premium unlocks nothing of value in the app and you still have at least a 4 good investment to use the features most would use. What's missing is the data needed to record against all the popular locations. Most apps, you pay for Pro, you get all the features. This app, you pay for Pro - which isn't cheap as apps go - and you then still have at least double this cost to enable the recording of the most popular places.",
      "I spent the better part of the evening feeling cool by checking off all the places I've been to. Obviously not all are available. Fair enough, I understand you can upgrade to get more features. But what drive me nuts are the obnoxious ads. We're not talking about a banner but a full screen ad. There's a timer to let you know when there are due, roughly every 5 minutes. So maybe if you don't stay long enough having fun like me, you might not be as annoyed. Not for me : deal breaker, unistalling.",

      "Very good app, but missing one feature. There isn't cost split option if you are travelling not alone. For example, traveller 1 paid for meal for himself, traveller 2 and 3, while traveller 4 was not eating. It is really good app and I use it all the time, since most of the time I travel alone, but if I have someone else with me - I need to use different app. One day when you fix it - you will be the best in the market :)",
      "Used it to track my expense for my New York trip last Christmas and it was very easy to use and helped a lot in terms of keeping me on budget. My only dislike is not being able to export the data unless a premium member. Nonetheless a great app highly recommend if you're travelling on a tight budget or you just wanna see how you spent money",
      "I am using the paid version of this and have found it useful, but one thing is frustrating me. I added a category and want to change the icon assigned, but can find no way to do that, or even delete the category I added and re-add it correctly. UPDATE: Thank you very much for your prompt reply. I'm sorry I am so late in letting you know that your suggestion worked perfectly and I have updated my rating from 4 to 5 stars!",
      "I loved using this app to track my spending while travelling. It is easy to use and puts the money in different categories and then allows you to view the break down of your spending. It really makes me accountable when spending abroad and has helped me save money. I love that you can make new trips and set a total budget that automatically sets a daily budget that is then attainable. The free version does have some pop up ads but well worth it to have such a great app for free! Highly recommend",
      "Great App. I am using their free version. And I am 100% satisfied with this app. I make positive impact. And if you are a budget traveller then it is best app for you. To write your day to day expenses. Automatic total calculation helps to find your average daily expense."

      "Complements well with the web version. In fact, it's best to plan your trip in front of the PC and use this app to view/modify your trip while traveling. That said, the UI could use some improvements",
      "First impressions planning a RV trip (FREE): Pros: Most destinations were listed and easily added to my trip. Itinerary relatively easy to edit. Places easy to add. Cons: No satellite, terrain, etc. views on maps. Maps not current for navigation...a major highway near me doesn't show completion...that's inexcusable. Weather forecast was COMPLETELY inaccurate... Unable to download. No easy NAVIGATE option from the itinerary...have to go deeper. This app has potential, but is really basic.",
      "I'm currently enjoying how easier it makes to plan a trip. The only thing I think is missing is a section to calculate expenses and maybe time indicators for each place added in a day. Also integrations with Omio and Airbnb",
      "I was interested in sygic travel Maps offline & trip planner, but after trying out the free ones, I found that many stores names were not on the map, even when searching they were not available, and sadly my place of residence address were not on the maps..malaysia",
      "Great app to plan any trip, by allowing you to lay out the sites you want to see, places you want to go, and seeing on a map how close/ far apart. This lets you plan your day in the most effecient sequence - LOVE it."

      "Spam spam spam. I have never seen an app that feels the need to spam both your sms, push and email notifications by default for opportunities for bookings. This is plain marketing manipulation. Be better guys. Manufacturers are trying to get people to look at their phones less and now you're pulling them in with every single means possible. Do better!",
      "The app is okay I guess, but customer service is horrible. I called in understanding I would have to stay on hold to talk to a representative but after not recieving any wait times and completing the same automated loop twice it hung up on me. This happened two times. If you are looking for a company that cares about customer service this isn't the one.",
      "I travel for work & have used ABB over the past year. Pros: ABB is global. It is THEE App to use for work travel & vacationing. It is fairly easy to use, once you learn how to navigate the program. Cons: I don't like that you cannot book multiple reservations at one time, each one a separate transaction. And that availability is not displayed in real time. Also messages don't always display right away. Consumer Advice: always use the \"Instant Book\" feature.",
      "Great app, easy to use, just with a few quirks. 1) The ratings are shown rounded to the nearest 0.5 so you often think they are more highly rated than they are (this definitely applies to your Saved lists, not sure elsewhere). 2) There isn't a way to change your payment methods unless you are about to book a place (or at least I couldn't find it). 3) When looking at a saved list alongside someone else (both using the app), we saw different prices - mine included service charge; his didnt.",
      "It's a great service really. I understand they are likely to take the blame for bad services provided by hosts which is unfair but I had one issue with the App company itself which I feel should be addressed. If you do not use the App for a long time and forget your password, the recovery and reactivation process is overkill. It's good to have tight security, but in my situation, it worked against me. How can some one abroad auenticate with their (likely) native phone? Security question, plz!"

      "Editing my previous review. I haven't used this app for long, but recently have discovered a massive glitch. It's tedious to make profile changes, cos the changes don't get properly saved. I have shifted to another place, literally 1000 kms away in another country, and yet I cannot update my home address. No matter what, the changes are \"saved\" but they are never \"stored\" and hence jump back to the previous address almost immediately.",
      "Couchsurfing really has a great potential to have an amazing positive impact on the way you travel and maybe even see life. As long as you keep one thing in mind: at the start it is frustrating that you won't get anywhere without having reviews and being verified. But it is free to get verified if you host someone. Once you have been verified and gotten a review it will be easy to find a couch. It really makes sense actually as it is supposed to be a two way system.",
      "I want to edit my review and dis-rate the app now because a big problem I have noticed with this app which I don't receive any notification shows that I received a message from someone unless I go to my inbox and check myself and which can be after so many days because I don't keep in my mind that I have to check my inbox all the time because it has to be automatically. According to me, it's a huge mistake and am very sure that all the people are facing the same problem. Hope you work on it..!!",
      "I get no notifications at all. My changed in the profile are not getting updated and saved. I can not upload more than one picture for some weird reason. Everytime I go to a screen I get this notification of agreeing to share data- how many times do I really need to tap on that? The app is too slow, it takes forever to load."

      "There aren't a lot of good apps out there for showing where you've been in a step-by-step process AND allowing you to post a lot of pics AND allowing you to tell your story. After a bad experience with an app that kept deleting my hard work, I downloaded a bunch of new ones and this is the only one I kept. It isn't perfect. Its tracking often stopped following me, so I had to enter a bunch of locations and times by hand. Suggestions for steps aren't great either. But uploading pics is intuitive.",
      "Downloaded the app on my 2 phones - one doesn't sync with the other after making changes. I have now one account on two handsets with different contents. I still think it's a good application and rate it highly. UPDATE: Very nice for the app authors to contact me when the fix was found. Now changing from 4☆☆☆☆ to the ultimate 5☆☆☆☆☆! Highly recommended! The more you populate your account with your travels, the more you will like it!",
      "Such a cool idea! I've made 3 trips with it far with the 3rd being over 5500 miles trip across U.S. and hundreds of pictures and vidoes. Still on 3rd trip and continuing to add. Originally Got app for the travel tracker...it works great. If your traveling long distances or taking a vacation, I would highly suggest.",
      "Really like the app: tracks you, reminds you to place a step and keeps you close to people at home. However it can do with some improvements: being able to like and reply to single comments (like in fb/insta) would be great and editing pictures in the app.",
      "Really nice way to record your trips and for your family and friends to keep up with where in the world you are. You can add photos and a description of each place you visited and it creates a nice little map of the route you took."

      "I know there is the Covid-19 virus going around, and of course the phones are busy, but why doesn't the app or the website let me cancel online? I have been trying since 8 am and I keep getting this error message: This is a new reservation and is currently in progress, please try again after 30 minutes if you wish to cancel. I made this reservation 2 weeks ago. It's now 4 pm and I have until 6 pm or the hotel charges me, non refundable. Fun? No. Can I give 0 stars?",
      "The actual act of reserving rooms at a later date is not as intuitive as it could be. A nice bright button on the home page after signing onto the app would be great, BOOK ANOTHER? Having said that, the app keeps me logged in, so that may be a problem. There's no readily identifiable way to delete mail after having read it.",
      "Got stuck in the cold after they took money for a reservation. 20 minutes on the phone asking where my confirmation is if the money was held only to be told that the system was \"updating\". On a Saturday night, it was \"updating\". Not enough to completely shut down the app or website, just enough so that it places a hold on your money while leaving you out in the cold waiting for a confirmation or support to answer your call",
      "This site has the worst useless outsourced customer service and lately I've had nothing but screw ups on their end with bookings. After paying much more due to errors they will not fix on their end with room type and billing, I am uninstalling this app. If you have a problem with your booking (and there's a good chance you will using this app) you'll spend an hour talking to a rep in another country who will tell you how they cannot fix the problem. Also you get worst rooms (handicap, no view)",
      "I've been a long time, regular user of this app/site. I booked a room 2 months ago for a room in a month from now. It was non-refundable but that was before COVID-19 & the closure of the border. I'm self-employed & am now out of work. The money I used to booked a room I am definitely NOT going to use due to a closed border should be returned to me as I clearly had nothing to do with travel restrictions. I can't get anyone on the phone or via web chat. How do I get my money back..?"

      "Very good app! If you're planning a trip or even looking for local options, you need this app. It's definitely one of my most used apps for a reason. It's very informative and helpful. It allows you to save things you find at a location to your \"places\" list that you create so when you go, open your saved destination and have at it. I planned a weeklong Vegas trip of things to do, places to eat, etc this way and never missed a thing. I ran out of vacation before I did options! Highly recommended",
      "This app is slowly improving. Most things you can do via the web interface, you can do with the app. However irritations such as embedded links not always opening, and the Inbox being slow to update private messages, mean that its not quite there yet.",
      "Have used this app for years. It has generally been very good. However I would suggest it would be more user friendly if a review writer was able to get into a review he has made. The reason being that some times after a report has been posted a writer picks up an error he has made. At present time it is a real drama to try and sort it out. If the writer could get into the review and edit it there and then, no dramas that would be a real plus. Just a thought. Regards Kiwi nev No action yet.",
      "This app is not very good. It tries to do a lot, but does it poorly. To search for a specific listing you're better off using Google. I tried writing a review and adding photos, and the app is painful in this regard - it just doesn't work properly. If you can, use the desktop version of the website, because it's less painful. You would after all these years that the developers might finally get it right. Sadly, this is not so.",
      "For checking out Hotel reviews it's fine. But I don't like it for booking a trip. Does not give clear per person pricing. Mostly just per night cost of a room. I want to know exactly what I am paying for. Even for rides to the Airport it says may include an extra charge. Then doesn't say how much. Think I will keep using a Travel agent. I don't want any surprise charges later."

      "The APP is not real time and definitely useless . I purchased ticket on february for a march 25 flt. I supposed to be asking for rebooking or refund because of flt cancellations due to covid, however my flt is not even listed in the app. My hard earned money will be wasted! I also emailed several times but an automatic reply has been sent with a useless message. Not useful at all!",
      "This app is soo hard to cancel and the design is confusing. And because of the design, I was able to purchase additional baggage to my return flight instead of from origin flight. I tried to cancel it right away, just 2 minutes but there was no support, no customer support at all. And they still purchase it without minding the customers side. It would be better to purchase your flight right away to flight companies than making use of their useless service. Their service is only for making money",
      "SCAM! Very deceptive and trashy app. It will change the price right as you're getting ready to pay. I checked actual airline site as well as others (couldnt use them because of my foreign credit card) mulptle times and the price hadnt change. The only amount that changed was the fees which began at 10 dollars and jumped up to 30. Pathetic they would stoop so low. That kind of trash should be criminal. Especially during a crisis!",
      "I booked my ticket in this app but i cannot find my booking number in the airline official website. Now i cannot requesta refund for my cancelled flight. This company is only after your money."

      "I used this app on two prior trips. On todays trip I am not able to check in on my local flight without a passport. Just learned that the original flight was to Toranto and even though I'm getting off in New York, it's treated as an international flight. To the point, I had to re-purchase a ticket for $283 in addition to the $100 skiplagged ticket that is non-refundable. Also, Skiplagged has no customer service to help you avoid these situations and in their terms, holds no responsability.",
      "Helpful for plan making and dreaming. Not only does the search engine allow you to use the algorithm that gave them their name and got them in trouble (by saving us too much money), it also allows you to skip this search feature because there is more to it when saving money or searching for the right flight. You can browse price differences between airports, you can see predicted/lowest prices on different days and you can save your search for when the price goes down.",
      "I have booked multiple flights + hotel rooms over the past 5 years with Skiplagged. It has helped us save money on travel and we have never had a single issue. On top of that, they recently gave me a full refund due to Covid-19 cancellations. This is a good company and I reccomend you try them out today!",
      "I have tried SkyScanner, then moved on to Fareness, now here. Cheapest prices and app is very easy to use. It seems like they care about the little guy. I just hope they don't go too main stream and forget us like everyone usually does. That said. Try to use it before they get too big.",
      "This has got to be the best app ever!!!!! I share it with all of my friends & family and it has increased our ability to visit one another across the states. * The prices are amazing. * You have multiple dates to choose from. * You are future travel dollars everytime you travel."

      "Great when it works, horrible when it doesn't. Zero customer service if you book a hotel with them. No option to get a live person as phone disconnect after 10 minutes automatically (they don't ever answer). Email support isn't good either. The hotel I reserved with them had no AC. Hotel released me with no penalty but over a week and Id90 support still hasn't been able to fix the situation on their end. Use another travel agency.",
      "For Hotels it is a great tool but be aware with the car rentals. We rented a car through the app and when we arrived at the car rental place in Mexico the internet price was only available with a $8.000 deposit and other prerequisits. We felt quite duped and had to pay $30 more a day than we thought initially. So we will not use the car rental tool anymore. We havent tried the flights yet",

It was greatly appreciated & I loved the service. I will keep using this service due to that.",
      "Horrible. First CheapTickets sent Email about flight change/ cancel on march 8th. Without any clear information which airline canceled what flight. When I looked up my reservations they were not canceled by airlines. I went to SeaTac airport to find out myself what is going on. Alaska airline rep. Told that all third party companies doing this practice misleading customers so they customers start panicking and try all at once cancel their bookings. I will never again use this company.",

      "Patience helpful, but considering the complexity and enormity of content, it works. Train Status function very helpful, as most trains are reliably not on time. Can be clunky. Useful to browse routes, learn about connections, make reservations. Many, many rules apply; critical to understand before purchase. App details most of it.",
      "Convenient but Glitchy. It is a must if traveling on Amtrak, but it will often display an outdated trip count for multi-ride passes, 1 out of 10 times ticket purchasing doesn't work, and some days the app will not let either of my two phones login to show the conductor my ticket. Always keep a paper copy on hand or a receipt with the QR code in your email as a backup. But even with those issues, I use it every day and it is great for tracking and using Amtrak on the go.",
      "This app is almost useless unless you know where the train routes go. There's hundreds of stations that don't connect so you have to play a guessing game for hours to attempt to plan a trip.",
      "Terrible. Glitchy. Round trip tickets do not show up. every time I want to use a multi-ride ticket, I have to search through my email, find the number, go back to the app, then search for the ticket. it's insane. Also it doesn't show how many points my account has. That's not really important, but the fact that the app doesn't update from whatever database they have just shows another flaw. Sometimes it crashes without reason, other times it won't let you buy tickets without any error codes.",
      "You can check the train schedule, buy your tickets and use this app to board the train. Really convenient! No standing in line to buy tickets."

The blurb says the company is for veteran backpackers but obviously not! Very unhappy 😖",
      "I'm a frequent user of the app. This week my travel got canceled by the coronavirus and they charged me anyways. There's no way to contact them to get a refund. The costumer service doesn't really exist and the hostel said that can't do anything about it. I feel robbed.",

Negatives for me would be bus tracker does not work when looking at individual ticket but when you go to main bus tracker part of app you can put in your bus number. The other bigger negative is when looking at your trips there doesn't seem to be any order into the way they are displayed. I have to look through a random list to find my ticket.",
      "Needs to have more ways to pay for the ticket instead of the usual way of going to the website which takes more data to load up the page. Vs the app having the pay pal option or just cash payment option. And being able to see the reservation in the app and store it in Mobile wallet in case you get locked out of your email account.",
      "The worst travel experience you'll ever have starts with this app. Ticket selection sucks. It will automatically change your selection to a different boarding station without letting you know... causing confusion and mistakes. Then the \"track bus\" will fail to load, so you can't check whether the bus is late or if you're in the wrong station... More confusion... Finally, schedule numbers, confirmation numbers, and station addresses are all located on different menus... An amazingly awful app.",
      "Signed in to a friend's account to pay for their ticket for it to change the passengers name to mine resulting in me having to pay to change the name back to theirs. That doesn't make sense. I shouldn't have to go back and change anything if it's already there to begin with. As soon as I put in my card info, I guess it changes the passengers name????? WHY? That's the whole point of me signing into their account, so all the info is already in place, so I can just put my card info in and be done.",
      "The app is pretty easy to use. My advice, book single trip tickets instead of round trip. If your plans change you won't lose too much money."

      "The company and the employees are excellent. I first experienced the app few years ago, got nervous as I could see negative feedbacks about the company but my experience turned out to be wonderful and terrific. I tried again this year and the workforce has become even better. Even though you have to wait a little bit and be patient, it's worth it if you get served by the right employee. In my case, I highly appreciated the employee named Quinn as he/she made my travel become easier than ever.",
      "Very complicated, does not pick input quickly, and does something else. Overlapping ads in a small space. Happy to uninstall.",
      "They didn’t mention that I m allowed only one check in bag when I was booking the ticket. Usually It's always 2. Now I had to pay $200 extra. And customer service is always busy and horrible.",

      "It's weird that any app that functions internationally doesn't have an option to select your currency or to change units of measurement, just really lazy. And the fact that you can't sort results and that the filter option is so barebones is really the nail in the coffin for me. I don't want just a long list of things and places or I could just read travel blogs, I want to be able to narrow stuff down from that list and get good info at a glance. This app just doesn't provide that.",
      "Overall it is a good map application with tons of useful POIs but it would be even more useful if the developer could add functions like POIs filtering (hotel, eateries, shopping malls, landmarks...) and also allow the user to add their own POIs. Map maker allows users to add their own POIs and it makes it a winner. But their database is not as rich as Michelin's.",
      "Best traveling unbiased, unpaid, unmarketed opinions. If you want to get out of the crowd, and get local insights without surprises, this is the way to go.",
      "No search filters. Just shows random stuff on a map but can't search. Hardly useful.",

      "Sorry to give low rating.... I love Viator, BUT this app is severely lacking... 1) you can search by location OR keyword, not both. If your trip is on Hawaii, and you want to go paragliding, you have to scroll through paragliding in dozens of other places first 2) can't add things to wishlist 3) wishlist can't be divided (e.g. by location when planning multiple trips) 4) setting date of travel should auto populate check availability, yet the ca keeps going to \"tomorrow\" Just a few major things.."

      "As long as there is no problem with the flights booked through this app, everything seems fine. But my flight was cancelled and they didn't even send me an email... i wanted to contact them by email, but no i can't, because email support is not available for my basic service package. You booked a flight for me and now it is cancelled, you should notify me on time and refund me!!",
      "The app works, the company sucks, even if your flight is cancelled or if the airline allows you to change the dates free of charge or to request a full refund, you cannot with them as they use their own emails to book your tickets so you cannot get in touch with the airline directly. They will not refund you fully even if the airline said so. Plus unless you have paid for full pro package, you cannot get in touch with them pretty much.",
      "One thing that would make this five star is if you could adjust specific segments of trips with multiple legs, especially on multicity or nomad trips. So for example, let's say I have 3 flights/transits and I find the perfect package for a departure and a return but I want to change the time of the middle leg, I should be able to freeze the departure and the return and simply choose a later/earlier flight for the middle leg. In short, let us freeze options we like and edit parts we don't like",
      "The app is ok to use but the service is really poor in general. I found out that my flight was cancelled by accident and had to request for a refund which they seemingly accepted but now they have given me an ultimatum to choose from; Accept £10 from them or wait up to 6 months to find out how much Ryan Air will refund when this shouldn't be the case as Ryan Air have already disclosed that they are issuing refunds. So it is a win, win situation for them and total loss for me!",
      "The app doesnt work to update the reservation when it's changed by the airline and the customer service is terrible. My flight was cancelled and it still showed as confirmed on the app with no option to get a refund. I spent more money and upgraded so I could chat and still no word from kiwi even days later. Slim chance of getting a refund now - I've exhausted all ways of contacting kiwi, even emailing app support and no response!! Don't use!!"

      "Buggy backup. I really liked the app at first as there are ample options to customize items and add categories. Being able to add custom bags is nice, although the app added several copies of the same bag. But when my phone crashed and I tried to get back my data, I got back my list, but not the content. I tried to send several emails to the developer to resolve the issue, but didn't get a response.",
      "Frustrating!!! I paid money for this app thinking that it would save all of my lists. I added a Vacation list of 143 items or so and when I went back into the app to add more items, everything was lost and I had to start from scratch. There was no retrieval of it. I re-entered the list, went back in a few days later to add a few more items and same thing again - I lost everything. Wrote to the seller, never heard a response....terrible app! Waste of money and time!!!",
      "Biggest problem for me with all these packing apps is that they come pre-configured with literally hundreds of items under sections that I will never ever use. As such I look for apps that allow me to edit Categories and the items in them so that when I select 'Beach' or whatever I only have to scroll through the items that I might normally take, not the 200 items I won't. Couldn't find a way to do this even with the paid version so, refund and delete. Far quicker to write a list out with pen and paper.",
      "Very helpful app! Easy to customize to your specific needs. This will help you remember all of the essentials for your trip as well as helping you to not overpack. Once you compile your list, you can generate a shopping list of all the items that you need to purchase.",
      "Probably the best packing list app I've ever tried. Being able to choose the items you need from a predetermined list is an excellent way to prevent forgetting important items or having to remove a large amount of items that don't fit your lifestyle. I definitely recommend this app for anyone who has difficulty packing or simply wants to make the process more efficient."

I have forwarded the details to the email address provided and only accommodation appeared in the app, but it didn't register half of the accommodation details and wouldn't allow me to edit and add those details manually.",
      "Really enjoy the app, has made keeping up a lot of travel easier, but not 100% but that maybe due to the back end information source that is pulled was not updated timely. Have seen a few funky bugs. But for a free product - excellent. Would love to see a desktop interface portred.",
      "Love this app and use it for all of my trips! Highly recommended! (we had a flight delay and this app alerted us before the airport or airline app even did!).",
      "Great App. Keeps me up to date with my travel schedule. Sends timely reminders. Makes traveling much easier."

    "comments":[
      "Ive used this app in the past many times for inflight entertainment with NO issues at all. Until yesterday March 14th the 4 of us in our party tried to it. we could look through all the movies and tv shows available however when we tried to pick a movie to watch a stupid error would pop up saying device needed to be in airplane mode to prevent interference. Well when you put your device in airplane mode WIFI disconnects. so NO United WIFI which means no movies. i had a isle seat so i was able to see some people watching movies. talk about a long 4.5 hour plane ride.",
      "There are many useful and good features for this app, but I feel TREMENDOUSLY disappointed that the feature to scan my documents -- passport, etc. -- does not work. I have to visit a kiosk anyway. And also, why can't we provide scans for check-in on the United PC website? Why only in the app? Wouldn't it make international travel easier if we were able to do it both places? Wouldn't it be great if the scan feature in this app had worked for me this morning?",
      "Not a great app. Crashes often, the inflight entertainment portion will not work on either my phone or tablet (makes for long flights when you were expecting to watch movies on the app), requires all kind of unnecessary permissions (microphone, location, storage...), very slow to react after clicking, can't check in, wouldn't recognize Canadian credit card, asks for ZIP code when I selected Canada (we don't use ZIP, we have postal codes). The text notification for flight delays did work though.",
      "This is the worst travel app I've had, possibly the worst app. One click takes ~30 seconds to go to the next screen, at which point it just crashes. I like United, but this just screams lowest possible cost for an app and a QA process that consists of \"Works on my device\". Don't waste your time, kill trees instead, or fly with any other airline.",
      "Could not select for non US credit card, even though there is nothing suggesting i am american. Passport photo process was finicky and took forever. And at the end of a gruelling process, check in failed with no explanation! Also wants your location, to run all the time and eat your battery. Wasted a lot of time with this surprisingly unfriendly app, makes me less likely to fly united and more likely to seek out competitors (what few remain) in the future."

      "It's great when it works properly. It continues to show me available seats. After entering all my information, it says the seat is no longer available. When I go back to select another seat, once again, I have to enter ALL my info, select a seat that is \"available\" according to the app, just to find out it's not available. it happens again continuing to show the seats are available when they aren't. For convenience, it's NOT that convenient. Very frustrating and disappointing.",
      "A clean and effective app for managing all of my flight check-ins. Only minor improvements needed. (1) Once checked in and on multi legs the app doesn't seem to know you've already done it. It shouldn't keep asking if I want to check in when the check-in is complete. (2) It can be a bit slow waiting for the pinwheel to stop processing. Sometimes you wonder if it got stuck.",
      "I rely on this app for most all of my travel (since Alaska has so many flights out of PDX - Portland, Oregon)...that I'm flying Alaska almost exclusively. It makes the check in and TSA so much nicer (with digital boarding passes and so much more that integrates with your mobile device... For example, you can easily add the flight info to your calendar, check - in and change seats, make flight changes when necessary, etc.). I think they've done a good job with the app.",
      "Wonderful Application, mileage tracking, booking and finding flights. Hotel and car rentals, check-in and your boarding pass; all on your phone. check on your flight schedule and updates, can be abit late sometimes, especially in Seattle. The gates jump around, the application helps. Would have five stars, but I have had to run",
      "App was easy to use but wish they would explain carry on baggage long before I was checking in . You have a change in carry on size that people should be aware of right from the start before checking in on the app..something I was scrambling at the last minute to do....also so good selection for a 6 hour flight sucks. Almost everything is crackers and cheese...no real food"

      "Terrible experience! Without my consent, I have been charged 2199/week by tourbar through Google play. I never used the trial version by myself. Listen, i wouldn't mind a subscription but that has to be by my choice not by deceit. Inspite of repeated request of refund of my money which was charged incorrectly, this app support did not respond 😡. If I don't get money refund asap, I am going to complain to court and will sue ur app.",
      "Bizarre. I cannot believe this app would ever be recommended for people to find travel partners! The fact you have the option to select whether you want your partner to pay for you entire holiday and can filter via 'height and build' means I wouldn't be surprised if 1.this app is mostly used by escorts and 2. if its used for human trafficking. The only 'matches' I was presented with was one of the creepiest lists of men I've ever bl***y seen. Weird.",
      "Worst experience. I can't even reply to the peoples who text me. And not able to start the ' just 7 days' trial without payment options. Developers, First i need try this app for somedays. After that if i don't like this app and cant cancel the subscription.. my money will be gone! Please make it trial without any payment option.",
      "Canceld trial after 10mins. Maybe make the app send messages for 24h or 7 days without mutual likes. Its a good was to market your product. Thanks anyway. App looked good. UPDATE: Used the trial, i am able message now and get full potential from this app. Really good app, people are legit, if someone is fake, u are informed person has been removed. One thing though, can you guys add the option to look theough different image folders on Android and there is a scroll issue in images fold Android",
      "Except for the paid subscription part, rest is all good. There's still a whole lot of room for the app to improvise in terms of the speed of loading pages and the features to communicate with friends!"

The guides they provided were extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They chalked out the plan well and never had any issues during the trip. Highly recommended",
      "I booked pawna lake camp via thrillophilia and experience was worst ..nothing is like as shown in picture...the campsite was very far from the lake on the top ...there was no indore games like carroms and all ...the site was very common and wasnt atall like they promised...there was no coordinator to reach the site and also no one was ready to guide us from thrillophilia whether where to go and which is the site ..",
      "The worst application.Do not make any bookings on this site..It is a fraud site..I made a booking and they just kept it in awaiting confirmation while my money was deducted.They mention numbers and email address for support but never respond. Dial the number and it will keep ringing even in business hours. Even if you send email to them they do not respond. They just dupe you for the money and don't answer at all.",

      "Needs to have a better off line version Generally a good app but it could be better.",
      "Very useful! Used it in Tokyo, Berlin, Rome, Florence, Venice and will use it shortly in Paris. Love the offline feature, it's super simple to plan and navigate. Well worth the money. Indespensible in Paris, especially during 2019/20 metro strikes. Very responsive and helpful customer service. Helped me with setting up App when I changed from ios to android without having to pay again. Highly recommended!"

It's useless if I can't zoom in without seeing pixels instead of fine details. But I also understand that you need to make money, and if everyone gets the free eBook, then you won't make money. But I would GLADLY pay for a high quality eBook. My rating is based on the future I would use the most, and at this point it doesn't meet my expectations."

    "title":"World Travel Guide by Triposo",
    "description":"Triposo is your smart travel guide - it’s free and works offline! Our awesome algorithms crunch through millions of websites and reviews to deliver unique recommendations across 50,000 destinations worldwide! Personalize your trip by picking your favorite hotels, sights, activities and restaurants and book them seamlessly in our app! That’s not all, our city maps work without internet so you can wander freely. \r\n\r\nDownload the Triposo app and start discovering the world today. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy you need Triposo\r\n\r\n• Triposo works offline so you can avoid expensive roaming charges and data plans - offline maps, offline routing and offline city walks all at your disposal.\r\n• Discover highlights and hidden gems in over 50,000 destinations worldwide through mini-guides created by locals or passionate travelers.\r\n• Book hotels, tours, activities and transportation all in one place seamlessly through our app.\r\n• Triposo is free and easy to use \r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures of our Android travel guide\r\n\r\n- Pick a country or major city and you can preview it right away. You can then dowload the full guide if interested.\r\n- A downloaded guide works offline, without an internet connection.\r\n- Each guide includes a country map and detailed city maps for the top cities. \r\n- Each guide includes info about the major sights, great restaurants, different nightlife options and more.\r\n- Currency converter.\r\n- Phrasebooks for the non-English locations including text to speech, depending on the capabilities of the TTS system available on your phone.\r\n- Weather forecast (updated when online).\r\n- Extensive information about local wildlife, festivals, culture, food for major locations. Less so for the others.\r\n\r\nOnce installed you have access to country guides covering most of the world and ranging from old time european favorites like Italy, Spain and France to more exotic destinations like Thailand, Vietnam or Cambodia.\r\n\r\nIf you only want a single city and don't want to download an entire country into this guide, we also provide city guides, covering the major tourist cities in Europe like Amsterdam, Rome, Paris and London, but also for slightly smaller places like Brussels, Oslo and Prague.

      "I like the simplicity of the app and the fact that it offers free downloadable travel guide. But I've tried to download several time (my internet speed is good) but it's doesn't work.",
      "Lot's of information, but there are many many bugs. The \"walk\" feature to walk the saved places doesn't seem to work. I can't create day plans and assign the saved places to several days etc. So it's quite useless for travel plans.",
      "Not good enough. Can't view individual items without downloading a whole, often quite large guides. Search within a guide is useless, just brings up paid tours and similar. Understand they need to make money, but I did pay for the app. Used to have an iPhone and the iOS so seemed to work much better. Interface here is pretty dated. I keep hoping for a good electronic travel guide but this just can't touch a book.",
      "I loved this app quite a lot for its offline functions and awesome information including inside the guides. It was quite handy while I was traveling around solo in Europe. Recently I downloaded it for another trip planning yet it got super slow and crashed sometimes. It is a pity that the app is unable to deliver those amazing information smoothly as before.",
      "Works okay for me. Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet (8\"), standard o/s. Don't understand the low ratings. Just remember that this app is primarily a catalogue listing separate country or area specific location Triposo guides, so the actual information in this app is naturally going to be rather sparse. #WorksForMe - thanks. 🍻"

      "Love the app, helps you see the property and areas that are around. Photos are very helpful, and the reviews. It shows the total price for your stay and some properties have pay at the property upon arrival. So you can actually book months in advance although with that option you may pay a little bit more. I'm ok with that cause it allows you to save up for your trip.",
      "used to be great, but this weekend it left us stranded due to double bookings. If you use it, make sure to contact the venue before booking. edit. It's now 8 months later. We again used it a couple of times and over this past weekend they AGAIN double booked us. This time I did contact the venue and they confirmed everything is fine, but upon arrival it obviously wasn't. Save yourself a lot of grief and uninstall",
      "I used this app in 2019 to book my first vacation. I was pleased with the locations I was shown & the options given. There was a smooth flow of communication between the host the app & myself. I was able to cancel with ease I was able to reserve same way and make additional requests. Emails from the hosts came in a timely manner because the feedback thru the app was perfect. As for the pricing I didn't feel I was over charged credit card information was protected. It is user friendly#great app💯",
      "Always makes it fast and easy to find a hotel! And prices are usually cheaper than booking directly through hotel, especially if booking last-minute. And when the hotel has no rooms available to book directly, there are usually some rooms available through this booking site. It also has detailed information regarding the hotels. I use this app a lot! I always end up finding a decent hotel in the end! Thanks so much 😊",
      "I believe the application through TripAdvisor then Google Play to Booking APP download relatively quick. I also was very impressed with the data submitted and quick confirmation via personal email. The special request is based solely on memory but prefer the upstairs. I stayed here in the past but cannot recall the room number but it was definitely upstairs. I hope the breakfast bar improved yet recall the bananas were good. The staff from what I recall very efficient checking into the motel. TY"

Now I'm going to have to spend the last day of my vacation finding somewhere that can print my boarding passes because the app does not work. It will be a long time before we fly American airlines again",
      "This app is way too hard to use. I was told to download it and follow the instructions before we take off. Well i did and i tried for an hour with no avail. Eventually i got to movies just to find the adds for them and more steps to follow. Plus you need wifi to use the app and to use the wifi you also need the app. It is a never ending cycle that gets you nowhere. My rating is below one star. The app is a utter disaster.",
      "I used to consider the AA app the pinnacle of airline apps. This latest version is too paired down. It is not easy to navigate (no burger/left nav or swipe indicators). I can no longer easily send or screenshot your itinerary to send to others. Instead I have to either send each flight individually or dig out the email to view my trip. Makes me want to travel even less with them.",
      "There's no way to remove boarding passes from previous flights, and the app invariably shows me the wrong boarding pass when I try to have it ready for the gate attendant. The widget is worse, and doesn't automatically pull info on my current flight. It always shows an older flight, and sometimes doesn't even refresh after going in to the app and refreshing it. This app needs another pass through QA and several additional functionality items before it gets handed over to the public."

Nowadays the app doesn't always find cheapest combinations of travel between certain destinations. When I book sections of the trip separately it can make quite a difference in price and makes my trip cheaper. Which kind of makes the app feel a tad obsolete.",
      "Tl;dr: download Trainline instead... For Omio's Devs: You should really work on the UX guys... The app is buggy (performing the same search at the distance of a couple of minutes yields different results) and it takes ages to view trains at different times (not always possible because sometimes the slider at the bottom is not there). Same situation in the web version (painfully slow). Also, a £3 fee on a £18 ticket is kind of a rip off, isn't it? Trainline's fee for the same journey is 75p...",
      "This app is a must have when traveling. If you find yourself staring at the Kiosks at the stations getting confused, download Omio. The app is quick and easy. Provides all the information on the trains before they even announce over the load speaker."

      "I don't drive, so planning my trips is a regular part of life. Rome2rio provides maps & optional methods of transportation (bus, drive, taxi, walk, etc) along with the estimated costs of those methods. Rome2rio has saved me a great deal of time by not having to go to multiple apps to gather the info I need, to ensure an accurate, well informed trip.",
      "Never reviewed an app before, but I will for this app. And it doesn't cost anything!! Got this when I moved to Europe for a few years traveling from Australia. And this app is the best thing I could have got. It will seriously get you anywhere. Given myself and groups ways on buses/trams and underground we didn't even know we're there. Any capital city it will help you map out the underground as well and tell you where to go, same as buses to and from the airport. Must have for traveling.",
      "Love this app, never had any problems and the details for onward travel have been amazing. It's taken me all over the world, using it locally in the UK, bus rides through Asia and Australia and have train plans next month in Europe. Features include walking directions between stations etc, approx price of fares, can filter the dates and times required and can link to buying tickets (although never used this option so can't comment.) Have recommended to many travellers along my journeys.",
      "I love that this app not only gives you various public transport options but also gives you the approximate price range of each option. It would be good if it also gave the times in the summary as well, but it's easy enough to find them out (a few clicks) Thanks!",
      "Fantastic App! Used it for the first time on a break in barcelona. We couldn't do without it, so helpful in getting around. Very reliable information, invaluable if using public transport. Would definitely recommend."

If you add second tick on the right side for packed item or change of color of the row or a line cut through the item for packed items it will be much better. One more suggestion. Please minimise the height of the rows, so that we can see more items at a glance. Thanks.",

I tried 3 or 4 other packing apps before I found this one, but this is the one I'm sticking with. Fantastic functionality for a free app, but I have paid for the premium version (without ads) to support the developer, it's worth it!",
      "I've done maybe 5 trips so far with this. I love how you can create a custom template and just copy it over for every trip and just remove the items that don't apply. I've created my perfect master list now. Even let's you put weights in and assign items to bags. My only wish is that you could see the weight of each item in the list so I can see at a glance which items are heaviest. You can see the weight of each bag when you edit a trip, but seeing it by category and item would be useful too."

      "Great app to budget your trip. It is very useful to calculate your travel budget before traveling around the world and serves as a travel planner. It helped me become a digital nomad. Recommending it also to backpackers and solo travelers. I love the gear section as well. It is a nice and visual attractive packing list.",
      "I love this app! Leap gave me a good idea of alternatives to my current lifestyle. I never thought I will be able to travel for more than two years but this is what I got as a result from this app's calculation and I checked it it makes sense! I got excited to give up 9to5 and start exploring the world. I recommend this app to everyone who is tired and bored of their current lives. This app has more than I expected and is therefore highly recommended.",
      "Excellent app for trip planning and budgeting. Finding it super useful for my long term travel preparations. Nice interface design as well. Had a minor technical issue at beginning and developer was super quick to respond and provide a fix. Upgraded to the full/premium version. Definitely recommend."

      "Overall experience is good. Two things I need to mention: 1) when you download your, sometimes it download previous one instead of downloading which I'm currently observing. 2) when it plays content bright pixel start blinking on top of the screen. Why?",
      "Used this program to post up our QCT Miami Daily City Tour and QCT Miami Black Heritage Tour in several segments. Once I watched the tutorials and worked with it over a period of time it became easier and easier to publish my tours, make changes/updates, and even add multiple languages and various voices to narrate.",
      "Time consuming with limited content. May be a glitch but when I search I get several tours not available in english even though default language is set to english. Abit of time wasted when tour names are the site name.",
      "wonderful idea! good implementation! can you add autoplay no gps mode so that one can listen the whole tour in a row sitting on a plane without manually selecting next point? Hack: share bluetooth in-ear with your mate."

I put the card information and buy and afterwards I got the mail with higher price. I checked again and did another book more to find out what happened. Because I got screenshot of the price. And I realized when you put the card information they add 90 USD for using the platform just one second before click buy. It's insane don't use this",
      "Booking is easy and flights are cheap, but customer service is inexistent, impossible to talk to someone, the word \"refund\" not to be found anywhere, the chat with the bot leads you in circles with an infinite series of \"you've been queued\" \"sorry if all our agents are busy\" \"anything else i can do for you?\" They make it so difficult to even get an answer, that the clear intention is to tire you to the point you give up. Thai Airways cancelled my flight, make it easier to be refunded. Simple.",
      "It's booked so well. But the fares it displays before filling in the details it increases after the process. I don't like it at all.",
      "I booked flight to Tblisi using edreams. The booking was fine and i got the confirmation,everything was ok. But as the airline cancelled the flight, i tried to call them for cancellation(no email for customer service), always getting busy pre recorded announcement.",
      "Bunch of hidden fees. Buyer beware. Edit: On top of the hidden fees, the site it says it charges your local currency, for me it was CAD and on the site during the purchase it said CAD. BUT when I looked at my credit card statement it turns out it was charged in USD. OK so I sent in a ticket on their website, it said they would have someone get back to me in a few days. Been about 2 weeks now with nothing. If I could give lower than 1 star here I would. Buyer beware."

      "The app worked great for awhile, but now I cant even look into booking a flight. If you put in an airport in the from and to sections, it stays blank. The number one feature, being able to book or check out potential rates and prices, is unusable. The app was never great, but if it fails to perform its primary function, then it is trash. Just use the website.",
      "I have the same general issues that most people have had. It loses trips just about every time I travel. When I try to reenter my info it can't find the trip at all. It also carries over to the website so luckily I screen shot my boarding passes as soon as i get them. Awesome idea, terrible execution.",
      "This app worked great until recently. My phone crashes whenever I try to open this app now and even locks my phone up to the point of needing a hard reset. Once I uninstalled it, my phone works fine. Guess I'll have to keep in uninstalled until the issues are resolved as I'd rather have a working phone. Samsung S20 Ultra+ 5G on AT&T",
      "It never works!!!! Everytime I attempt to open the app just shuts down. Which defeats the whole purpose of the app. I can't book flights, I can't check-in, I can't use to scan my tickets which means I know have to have a paper ticket. I can't do ANYTHING!!! I have updated, I have uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing works! Someone please fix because this is crazy and very inconvenient.",
      "Generally 'stale', not dynamic app - fails at giving passengers up tp date info. Ex1; Does not provide or update gate information (even 30min from departure time). Ex2: cannot change flight for cancelation (though email points you to app to do so). Ex3: boarding card often reverts back to \"check in\" after you've done so - board pass unreliable when you need it."

I now unfortunately have to delete each one that I double save as way point. Also, it would be nice to be able to add option to categorise our waypoint for example by country. And also if the name of the country can come below the city's name. We are not all familiar with these places.",

      "Superb app. You got deals from min 3 agents. You discuss, analyse and choose the best suitable. The attractive thing is that this platform acts as mediator between you and agent so that the trust factor is added on in any deal. Agent won't generally misbehave because TT is watching him... Payment inatallments, tracking and instant update/notification about your installments!! Everything on a single screen... that's also one of the wow things of the app as well as TT. Best exp till date.",
      "Very bad experience with travel triangle. We booked a package with 4 star hotels for our Kerala trip but they provided hotels which are not even worth of 1 star. Just a waste of money. They are simply making profits. Before making the payments we will get multiple calls but during the trip if we get any issue they will not respond.",
      "Poor... We had poor experience when we booked our Himachal trip iN December 2019 when the agent cheated us and booked an inferior Hotel at Manali wheb their invoice indicated a different hotel... We have already complained about this a thousand times a d requested for a refund... Travel Triangle sided with the agent and took thier side... Will never book in your pathetic app again",
      "Quotes for all locations, domestic or international, are available instantly from multiple travel agents who are ready to customize packages. Am a frequent user and would recommend.",
      "Dont install the app, these people are frauds, they took away 150000 rupees from my bank account. For which I am having a legal battle with them. This App steels your personal data as well. I have staryed receiving calls from different travel related businesses after installing this app. Uninstall the app and never do business with these fraud people and company."

      "First they ask to access ALL your photos, even private ones. That's a bad \nprivacy violation. Then the app automatically builds photo album about \nplaces where we've been (all, no possibility to select, it means giving all \ngps data to them, without having an account!) and after creating an \naccount, these albums disappear. Where is my data now? Stored with no name? \nThen it asks to review places which I never heard. A well-done review takes \ntime and time is money. Not to mention if we add good photos of the place. \nThey ask this service for free, or better, in change of \"the chance\" of \nwining 200$ in travel services. Which is nothing. Not least, the app \ncontinuously run in background, sucking resources and energy for nothing. I \nreceive frequent notifications of it from the system. I'm sorry, but I \ndon't understand the utility and benefits, maybe I'm missing something? Be \ncareful before giving your data for nothing!"

      "Great idea. Very useful application. So easy and simple to use. The concept and design are convenient. Thanks.",
      "Nice idea, not great execution. Matching doesn't work properly and therefore finding trip buddies is hindered. For example if I dislike someone and then like the next person, the 3rd card is again the 1st person that I disliked. This becomes an infinite loop. Can't create trips ideas for people to join in, only few agencies are promoted.",
      "Great idea! there are times when it could be really difficult to have your friends organized for an adventure and it is awesome to be able to find other people out there who are eager to travel and explore. The app is awesome and I recomend it 100%!!! Kodos to the team who put it together!",
      "I’ve tried other travel apps in the past but this one is by far the most advanced one! Finding other travelers with similar interests, having your own travel content, browsing through interesting tour offers - they have everything in one place!"

      "Absolutely Amazing! Only been using a few minutes and I love it. It's time consuming to set up but worth it for planning a big trip. If you like to have all the info in front of you for sights you will be seeing and how to get there but want to go digital then this is the app to use. I appreciate it's free and can be used offline with the exception of planning to get to your destination because you need to be online for Google maps, oh using Google maps is another great thing about this app! I can't wait to share my trip plan when I'm done, yet another feature it has! Thanks!",
      "Just started using this because I needed an app to plan my trip without having to book anything yet, and this is perfect! I could map out my days with or without specific timings, plan my budget, share with friends... Superb app. I only hope to be able to find more locations because there's too many specific places that I can't find probably due to them being lesser known spots. Other than that, it's perfect and I might just go pro for it.",
      "Perfect app for all planning and travels. would be 5 star if the distances and transportation mode is able to be selected within the app so users could see at a glance the distance and transportation modes. Google should have acquired you guys to work on their Google Trips! with Google tickets, passes, flights etc. sync to the app via. Gmail would be perfect!!",
      "very easy to use. I would love it more if we could create group or share our travel profile with partner soo they have it on their phone and can look or add whenever and see updates. Id also wish you could link website or google photos instead of screenshoting a must see and then loading it. Money input in US $ would be great. view option button nd see plans in photo version not just text"
