      "More than the app the problem is their costumer service. 5 mails sent, 5 times they replied without spending one second to understand my needs, and without solving my problem. In other words, if you book with them, forget the chance to indicate your frequent flyer number, as in my case, and for 4 different flights, it was not possible. Never again.",
      "The APP is not real time and definitely useless . I purchased ticket on february for a march 25 flt. I supposed to be asking for rebooking or refund because of flt cancellations due to covid, however my flt is not even listed in the app. My hard earned money will be wasted! I also emailed several times but an automatic reply has been sent with a useless message. Not useful at all!",
      "This app is soo hard to cancel and the design is confusing. And because of the design, I was able to purchase additional baggage to my return flight instead of from origin flight. I tried to cancel it right away, just 2 minutes but there was no support, no customer support at all. And they still purchase it without minding the customers side. It would be better to purchase your flight right away to flight companies than making use of their useless service. Their service is only for making money",
      "SCAM! Very deceptive and trashy app. It will change the price right as you're getting ready to pay. I checked actual airline site as well as others (couldnt use them because of my foreign credit card) mulptle times and the price hadnt change. The only amount that changed was the fees which began at 10 dollars and jumped up to 30. Pathetic they would stoop so low. That kind of trash should be criminal. Especially during a crisis!",
      "I booked my ticket in this app but i cannot find my booking number in the airline official website. Now i cannot requesta refund for my cancelled flight. This company is only after your money."

    "comments":[
      "Updated - Needs a lot of work. It should provide boarding passes after they are sent to tripit. It doesn't let you enter your phone number from your phone (laptop works). Not even from desktop mode on phone because it does it \"automatically\". Except it doesn't. It also won't let you delete a single flight that it has in error. The app is okay at finding flights in email though. It couldn't see one leg of my trip, is there a maximum of 5 flights?",
      "Disappointing. Basic info shows up in one place, which is nice. No integration of frequent flyer or rewards memberships in trip content. Keeps losing email scan capabilities so I have to reset it every time. And now the option to reset it from the app setting has just disappeared. Right now I could type info on a plain document and get the exact same capabilities I am getting from tripit.",
      "Badly let down by the map functionality. Yes, you can plot points on a map but despite Tripit's claims, you cannot view the whole itinerary on a map. Going into map view displays itinerary points within the immediate vicinity of the start point but you can't view anything further afield. The app links into Google maps but normal zoom functionality (+/- buttons, pinch etc) is missing so it is not possible to zoom out. I could only see half my itinerary on the map. Pointless.",
      "App keeps freezing after editing trip and I have to lock my screen and then unlock just to be able to close the app. I wouldn't use it except for the fact it has the simplest and easiest way for the parents of 20 students to see the info on a trip abroad I'm organizing. Pain for me but provides the best way to view for them. I have a Samsung Note 10+. Just as a note, the web version appearance is unsightly and overly complicated. If it had the same kind of view as the app, I'd stick with that.",
      "The itinerary for the flight works decent. Now, the \"enter name\" for hotel location and car rental for example, it would be nice to have the cursor in the field already rather than having to touch the field. For the names and fields, please have the field auto-capitalize the first letter automatically :) Otherwise, the search feature works well only typing say the \"Hotel Name\" with street number generally pops up the information quickly. I think the overall UI for each section such as car rental, flights, etc can use more icons and colors. It looks a little bland. Overall functionality compared to other trip planner app seem to work well so giving it 4-stars. Looking forward to more improvements! Thanks :D"

Recently found out that if i share a trip with someone, if i am logged into my account when they open the shared link, they have complete access to my profile and my other saved trips. They can modify/delete my personal info. and trips. This does not occur if i am logged out. Major privacy issue.",

Especislly since you can save articles, pictures of locations, and get good deals. I just wish that I was able to do the same for traveling in the states. I was able to save articles but the articles did not have pictures of the restaurants. I would like to see listings of restaurants and be able to save that restaurant.",
      "It's simply amazing. Used their website for a while, now discovered the app. Been helpful for Vietnam and Cambodia so far, I'm sure it doesn't end there. Improvement ideas: allow to copy the address, that way I'd be able to quickly past it to the ride hauling app (or better yet, integrate buttons for the ride hauling apps installed - if that's technically feasible)",

There research has always been accurate in my experience and I find it very easy to use especially for short trips where you need to cram in as much of the good stuff as possible, this app has saved me time.",

      "Tried a London Art Nouveau walk yesterday. It was helpful but a little sparse and some buildings were more or less interesting. Plus some long walks between them, where perhaps links to City Mapper might help."

I cannot trust this app anymore.",

Also adding flights with only alphabetic characters works, but many flights also have digits in there (eg are alphanumeric and not alphabetic). I end up putting most of my itinerary in there manually. Oh and it looks like the app is from the nineties - very old design.",

      "A nice app, very much like WorldMate. Unfortunately there is one BIG FAILING. The trips are all stored in cloud, rendering the app useless once traveling, unless you have roaming data or available WiFi. Such a big let down, as WorldMate stored all your trip details on your device. Why TripCase can't do the same is beyond me. A bid step backwards.",
      "Not impressed. The issues I had years ago still are there. Does not merge reservations automatically. When merging manually still is clunky and doesn't put things in the correct order (flights completely out of order timewise, hotels on wrong days, doubling of entries for not explicable reason you name it and no way to fix manually). One trip and not impressed."

      "Thank goodness for CheckMyTrip. Part of our flight was canceled, and another part of it re-routed. We have yet to be advised by the airline, but we got prompt updates with CheckMyTrip. We would have started the 2.5 hour trip to the airport without being aware of the changes. Love this app!",
      "Promising but buggy. I downloaded it today considering it's from Amadeus, which is a well-known industry standard software, I was really expecting more. I have recently booked a return train journey and accommodation through well known booking sites. I have forwarded the details to the email address provided and only accommodation appeared in the app, but it didn't register half of the accommodation details and wouldn't allow me to edit and add those details manually.",
      "Really enjoy the app, has made keeping up a lot of travel easier, but not 100% but that maybe due to the back end information source that is pulled was not updated timely. Have seen a few funky bugs. But for a free product - excellent. Would love to see a desktop interface portred.",
      "Love this app and use it for all of my trips! Highly recommended! (we had a flight delay and this app alerted us before the airport or airline app even did!).",
      "Great App. Keeps me up to date with my travel schedule. Sends timely reminders. Makes traveling much easier."

When I finally got through, the agent uttered I was being unresponsive and quickly hung up while I was talking. She literally gave me 1 second to reply while on hold for over 2 hours. Now I'm stranded outside the country in this crisis because the airline canceled a flight and put me on a connection before the first flight. I'm not a time traveler. Thanks Expedia!",
      "This app sucks, how did it get 4.5 stars? You will NOT GET ANY REFUND if you cancel a flight. You will only get CREDITS can only be redeemed by calling them. You cannot use your credits on the app!!! And they have some technical issues so you cannot call them to book a flight. So your refund money is gone. The app sucks.",
      "DO NOT BOOK TRAVEL WITH THIS APP!!! Due to covid19, we had flights booked. The airline canceled our flights but cannot refund us because we booked with Expedia. Expedia's robotic call system will not allow us to speak to an agent and there is STILL no option on the app for a refund. We are trapped in a foreign country as they have our money and we cannot book another flight. We are not the only ones. UPDATE: Your reply matches Expedia's Mar 12 email, but nothing has changed with ref to refunds.",
      "I found the travel insurance that is offered to be useless in the face of a real emergency. I purchased my trip long before the COVID virus was announced. I am outraged that the travel insurance company was allowed to add a bunch of exclusions concerning COVID-19 long after my purchase. AIG altered the policy to avoid paying out. In my opinion, the insurance offered is a scam.",

Otherwise  the stylist font looks good but very difficult to read. Thanks in advance.",
      "What an infuriating app. Every time I download I try to log in using my Lonely Planet ID. Nope, this app is only interested in new accounts. Cant even do that as of course my email address already exists in an account! Waste of my time. I shall go back to Google's trip planner instead. At least they let you use their one!",
      "The app is great and when it works it is good and interesting but most of the time I use the search it crashes with 'no network connection' and the option to 'try again'. This happens when I have a good connection and other apps have no problems etc..?",
      "[Edit] so you say I can edit my trip offline, and then publish it all at once? How do I edit a photoblog, 100 photographs all at once? How many days do you have where there is enough time to add 50? Or let's say 30? In reality the design of the app is flawed, if it can't scale to more than one trip uploaded in its entirety, what about the people using the three minutes of airtime they could scrounge, each day, in Bali, under a volcano, trying to tell the story the world wants to hear? Must they sweat it out, not having the USA's 300mb/sec, but a paltry 2mb/sec line they are only too grateful for. You need to travel, you need to experience frustration of watching gmail take 20 minutes to display one screen in Malawi and then tell me I must edit my story offline. This is lonely planet, a travelers go to site, not the Aldi app I put my shopping list into. Imagine trying to explain an earthquake in Haiti in twenty words, and the half a jpeg that managed to upload.",
      "I had a really frustrating experience. i had written a pull post up (took me probably 2 hours) and becuase there is no draft saving mode I lost everything when the app closed out. I uninstalled it becuase of this. i was really excited to use it too 😔"

      "Complements well with the web version. In fact, it's best to plan your trip in front of the PC and use this app to view/modify your trip while traveling. That said, the UI could use some improvements",
      "First impressions planning a RV trip (FREE): Pros: Most destinations were listed and easily added to my trip. Itinerary relatively easy to edit. Places easy to add. Cons: No satellite, terrain, etc. views on maps. Maps not current for navigation...a major highway near me doesn't show completion...that's inexcusable. Weather forecast was COMPLETELY inaccurate... Unable to download. No easy NAVIGATE option from the itinerary...have to go deeper. This app has potential, but is really basic.",
      "I'm currently enjoying how easier it makes to plan a trip. The only thing I think is missing is a section to calculate expenses and maybe time indicators for each place added in a day. Also integrations with Omio and Airbnb",
      "I was interested in sygic travel Maps offline & trip planner, but after trying out the free ones, I found that many stores names were not on the map, even when searching they were not available, and sadly my place of residence address were not on the maps..malaysia",
      "Great app to plan any trip, by allowing you to lay out the sites you want to see, places you want to go, and seeing on a map how close/ far apart. This lets you plan your day in the most effecient sequence - LOVE it."

What if pick up and return address for car rental is the same? Why separate fields for address, city and country? Should be simplified. 2) doesn't work offline.

      "Very good app! If you're planning a trip or even looking for local options, you need this app. It's definitely one of my most used apps for a reason. It's very informative and helpful. It allows you to save things you find at a location to your \"places\" list that you create so when you go, open your saved destination and have at it. I planned a weeklong Vegas trip of things to do, places to eat, etc this way and never missed a thing. I ran out of vacation before I did options! Highly recommended",
      "This app is slowly improving. Most things you can do via the web interface, you can do with the app. However irritations such as embedded links not always opening, and the Inbox being slow to update private messages, mean that its not quite there yet.",
      "Have used this app for years. It has generally been very good. However I would suggest it would be more user friendly if a review writer was able to get into a review he has made. The reason being that some times after a report has been posted a writer picks up an error he has made. At present time it is a real drama to try and sort it out. If the writer could get into the review and edit it there and then, no dramas that would be a real plus. Just a thought. Regards Kiwi nev No action yet.",
      "This app is not very good. It tries to do a lot, but does it poorly. To search for a specific listing you're better off using Google. I tried writing a review and adding photos, and the app is painful in this regard - it just doesn't work properly. If you can, use the desktop version of the website, because it's less painful. You would after all these years that the developers might finally get it right. Sadly, this is not so.",
      "For checking out Hotel reviews it's fine. But I don't like it for booking a trip. Does not give clear per person pricing. Mostly just per night cost of a room. I want to know exactly what I am paying for. Even for rides to the Airport it says may include an extra charge. Then doesn't say how much. Think I will keep using a Travel agent. I don't want any surprise charges later."

I was told this app was garbage but didn't listen. Lesson learned!! Hopefully nobody else has to go through this. Book airlines and hotels on your own through Google and save the headache",
      "Booking was easy. Good luck with customer support. I've been trying to call for 2 days now with no response. I can't even get a hold of a real person and the AI support just keeps sending me on a loop so I can't cancel my flight. Once this trip is settled I'm never using this again",
      "Incredibly frustrating to try and cancel a reservation using this app. In fact, it was actually impossible for me. I ended up having to cancel the hotel and the flight individually with the providers. I have since deleted and uninstalled this application and will never use Travelocity again in my life. What a joke.",
      "Booked hotel for 3 days, due to weather, needed to cancel one night, but app only allowed total cancellation, could not contact Travelocity by phone to cancel just 1 day due to \"technical difficulties\" on their end. Contacted hotel to cancel 1 day, but hotel said they would do it but couldn't due to it being booked through Travelocity. After trying for 3 hrs to contact representative had to cancel through app costing me $200.00. I missed cancellation mark by one hour. Thx Travelocity for nothing",
      "Would NOT recommend using this company! When I went to book one hotel room, the site told me that it had timed out and not went through, so naturally I did it again. I ended up being charged for 2 rooms and have been trying for days to get ahold of them to get refunded , with no luck yet. The phone lines always say \"we are having technical difficulties, please call again later\", no response from FB messenger, or email either. I just want my money back from my unused hotel room.."

So, I decided to create an app which specially made for group/solo expenses.&quot;</i> <br><br>This app has following features:<br>• Create multiple trips to manage expense<br>• Add places in visit list<br>• Add description/note<br>• Create a shortcut to easily access any trip detail<br>• Split expense between people<br>• Share By option to add expense for selected people<br>• Add deposit amount for any person<br>• Import/Export trip expense<br>• Share trip expense in excel sheet format<br>• View trip stats by category, date and person wise in Pie and Bar chart<br>• Add/edit/delete expense category<br>• Add background image for any trip<br>• Add expense in multiple currencies<br>• Edit/delete expense details<br>• Sort expense details according to person/date/category/share by<br>• Search trip<br><br>This app is easy to use and almost cover all requirements related to the group expense and single person trip. <br><br>Please email question/feedback and suggestion directly to the developer.",

      "Love this app. Use it every travel and it is awesome. Highly recommend it kf you like keeping an eye on what your money goes to. Also really good to better set the budget for future trips! Love love love it! Only wish it had a barcode reader or scanner for tickets, but still easy to use as it is. 👍",
      "Usefull app. But I can not export do GDrive - it creates file of 0 bytes size. Useful functions would be: duplicate item, category review by list/table (not only graph), average spent per day for categories (e.g. for holiday), date of item - not today's date, but selected according to last item's date (e.g. if adding all spendings at once after holiday).",
      "This is one fantastic app for group travelers who want to save themselves from all the budget distribution among all,which is most painful thing to divide and distribute amount. You can use this app which is very user friendly and easy to use. I have just now used for my jaisalmer new year trip.",
      "This is an amazing app! I am tempted to give 5 stars but it can improve on two things - 1. It is not immediately clear how to assign an admin (long press). Mention it or make this available on menu. 2. At the end of trip, it would be awesome to have a table that says who pays how much yo whom to settle dues.",
      "Hi ... Please explain how do we put an expense limit to the categories and the with ongoing trip spending, we get to see the remaining balance amount for the category ? Unanle to find the feature in the 'Manage category'. Thank you..."

      "Save your time from using this app, and using priceline. I have booked a hotel with priceline. Chat and called because I could not make it to my reservation due to the quarantine, and both hotels and priceline declined my refund. Not only that, the representative for Priceline stated that I would receive a call in 15 mins. 45 minutes has passed by, and no call. Please reframe from using this application and Priceline in general. They are a rip off, and only about the company policy. Unbelievable",
      "This app seems more for buying a new trip then tracking one. I love priceline and all the people in custermer support, the deals, updates in the email but the app is not geered for that service. It seems to really want bew business. I am un installing it.",

      "I used like 5 different apps back and forth trying to find a decent flight, and this one ended up being not only the easiest, but definitely the cheapest. Doesn't direct you to another site to book, and you individually choose departure and return flight. Super helpful and informative.",
      "It's great except using it for flight. The date of birth is not the most efficient. Scrolling several pages to get to my birth year was ridiculous. At the end, it kept the correct month and date but stayed with 1990. I tried three times. It needs to be fixed. Other apps use easier ways to get dob."

      "There aren't a lot of good apps out there for showing where you've been in a step-by-step process AND allowing you to post a lot of pics AND allowing you to tell your story. After a bad experience with an app that kept deleting my hard work, I downloaded a bunch of new ones and this is the only one I kept. It isn't perfect. Its tracking often stopped following me, so I had to enter a bunch of locations and times by hand. Suggestions for steps aren't great either. But uploading pics is intuitive.",
      "Downloaded the app on my 2 phones - one doesn't sync with the other after making changes. I have now one account on two handsets with different contents. I still think it's a good application and rate it highly. UPDATE: Very nice for the app authors to contact me when the fix was found. Now changing from 4☆☆☆☆ to the ultimate 5☆☆☆☆☆! Highly recommended! The more you populate your account with your travels, the more you will like it!",
      "Such a cool idea! I've made 3 trips with it far with the 3rd being over 5500 miles trip across U.S. and hundreds of pictures and vidoes. Still on 3rd trip and continuing to add. Originally Got app for the travel tracker...it works great. If your traveling long distances or taking a vacation, I would highly suggest.",
      "Really like the app: tracks you, reminds you to place a step and keeps you close to people at home. However it can do with some improvements: being able to like and reply to single comments (like in fb/insta) would be great and editing pictures in the app.",
      "Really nice way to record your trips and for your family and friends to keep up with where in the world you are. You can add photos and a description of each place you visited and it creates a nice little map of the route you took."

I have it set to start and stop trips manually, which works well for me, because I can immediately designate if this trip is business or personal. If I forget to start or stop a trip, it's very easy to edit. It leaves me in control.",
      "Very well made, and easy to use. Needed it for work trips. Tried several overdeveloped applications, but this one just/only did what I needed: - Automatically starts trip based on Bluetooth connection - Easy to switch trips between business and private - Ability to export (needed subscription). - Recognized stored places and adjusted private/business notation based on stored places automatically. Possible improvements: - Export is in a old excel version, please update to latest version. - Issue with odometer. Sometimes I used the bike to travel. Cannot turn off odometer registration or switch between vehicles. Just ignored this registration because i just needed the traveled distance.",
      "It's been great so far. Automatically starts when my phone connects to the bluetooth in my car.",
      "It's ok but not 100 percent reliable. I find I have to make a few manual edits to correct entries.",

      "This app looks really nice! Very easy to use, lots of features and good information about sights and cities. But it's still not really useful for day plans: 1) there's no option to sort the places automatically by distance from each other, so the \"route\" view in the map is totally chaotic with lines going upside in all directions 2) there is no way to see the \"real\" route from one place to the next on, there are just straight lines. 3) no saved places from Google maps. Can you somehow show them?",
      "The app is about 80% to a good trip-planning app. It lacks a few features, but mostly only little things. The major issue I have with it is that it only allows national or city-wide plans. States, regions, provinces, etc. should be included, too. Some nations, like the US or China, are too big to see in a single trip, and others that serious travelers usually only focus on one region at a time (France and Greece spring to mind). Please add in-between planning abilities!",

      "Absolute garbage. Lost my entire itinerary after an update. Worst travel app I can imagine.",
      "Nice travel planner. Easy to use with drag and drop. I plan on country, city and daily level and this app allows me to do so. I also get country insights straight from Wikivoyage. Sharing the trip with friends makes it easier to talk about without writing down everything. Cool end to end planning that lots of other apps lack. I planned my Canada, Morocco and Germany trip with it and will continue to do so. Plus, the app doesn't require unnecessary or loads of privacy permissions! Can't beat!"

      "On the surface this app looks great. I planned my itineraries, but didn't book anything with the app. However, once I got to my destination I found out almost all the information was wrong. It couldn't pinpoint my location (I have an international plan) and instead of informing me of that, it would just show me in a wrong location. I couldn't adjust it either. Then every single one of the times to get from place to place was wrong. This app ended up being a huge disappointment.",
      "Visit A City is an extremely useful app for trip planning. The #1 feature is its ability to automatically arrange stops by proximity to limit the extra walking back and forth. It allows you to make your own by highlighting what you want to see but also has suggest itineraries for a number of different days and styles.",
      "Make your experience visiting a new city organized and easy. You can be militant with your schedule, or as care free as you want. Customization is good. I would give it a 5 if through the customization it would also help optimize your walking path.",
      "I've been using this app for my trips. I really like the options they give you depending on the length of your stay. The idea of being able to change times and places is very smart.",
      "Very handy app! I've loved using it so far. The only thing I would say is when moving an activity from one day to a different day according to personal choice, it would be useful for the app to rearrange the other activities in terms of travel to and from it, as it does that in the first place, as I then struggled to rearrange the day to make most sense. Other than that, very useful app! Would recommend."

      "I know there is the Covid-19 virus going around, and of course the phones are busy, but why doesn't the app or the website let me cancel online? I have been trying since 8 am and I keep getting this error message: This is a new reservation and is currently in progress, please try again after 30 minutes if you wish to cancel. I made this reservation 2 weeks ago. It's now 4 pm and I have until 6 pm or the hotel charges me, non refundable. Fun? No. Can I give 0 stars?",
      "The actual act of reserving rooms at a later date is not as intuitive as it could be. A nice bright button on the home page after signing onto the app would be great, BOOK ANOTHER? Having said that, the app keeps me logged in, so that may be a problem. There's no readily identifiable way to delete mail after having read it.",
      "Got stuck in the cold after they took money for a reservation. 20 minutes on the phone asking where my confirmation is if the money was held only to be told that the system was \"updating\". On a Saturday night, it was \"updating\". Not enough to completely shut down the app or website, just enough so that it places a hold on your money while leaving you out in the cold waiting for a confirmation or support to answer your call",
      "This site has the worst useless outsourced customer service and lately I've had nothing but screw ups on their end with bookings. After paying much more due to errors they will not fix on their end with room type and billing, I am uninstalling this app. If you have a problem with your booking (and there's a good chance you will using this app) you'll spend an hour talking to a rep in another country who will tell you how they cannot fix the problem. Also you get worst rooms (handicap, no view)",
      "I've been a long time, regular user of this app/site. I booked a room 2 months ago for a room in a month from now. It was non-refundable but that was before COVID-19 & the closure of the border. I'm self-employed & am now out of work. The money I used to booked a room I am definitely NOT going to use due to a closed border should be returned to me as I clearly had nothing to do with travel restrictions. I can't get anyone on the phone or via web chat. How do I get my money back..?"

I now unfortunately have to delete each one that I double save as way point. Also, it would be nice to be able to add option to categorise our waypoint for example by country. And also if the name of the country can come below the city's name. We are not all familiar with these places.",

Also if I search for fights with 2 adults and 2 children to somewhere that is not a listed destination, it then goes to a new screen where I have to select flights, again, and it forgets that is for 2 adults and 2 children and finds flights for a single traveler. Even if you click on a selection you can't add note passengers and redo the search.",
      "So i have a new phone... When you first install the app, you don't get that screen on first use. You are offered the opportunity to set up an account (which i skipped) then you get a \"where do you want to go\" screen with no option to tap search, then flights. Only by closing the app and reopening does dialog as you describe it get presented. Maybe you need to rethink the after install use cases?",
      "Terrible app on a mobile phone, text overlapping and filtering is hard to navigate, especially when trying to look at monthly flights. Overall very poor in comparison to the actual website. The whole app GUI needs completely overhauled. Uninstalled & now using the website. Also, judging by other reviews, Skyscanner aren't listening to customers.",
      "Privacy problems. No matter what I do, turn off all location settings and this app can override and figure out the country I'm in. While this is a privacy concern, the third party search results remain in the wrong currency and language despite setting them in the Skyscanner app's preferences. Uninstalled.",
      "I was just told month view available by tapping the dates box? To clarify I was looking for the \"anytime in a particular (April) month / whole Month\" option as offered in the browser version? Thanks for your explanation I'd already seen the graph view didn't realise it was a replacement."

      "Sorry to give low rating.... I love Viator, BUT this app is severely lacking... 1) you can search by location OR keyword, not both. If your trip is on Hawaii, and you want to go paragliding, you have to scroll through paragliding in dozens of other places first 2) can't add things to wishlist 3) wishlist can't be divided (e.g. by location when planning multiple trips) 4) setting date of travel should auto populate check availability, yet the ca keeps going to \"tomorrow\" Just a few major things.."

      "This app is useless if you're tryijg to track a King County Metro bus. They only update the est. arrival time after the bus is already late and always by 2-4 minutes. If the bus is late they add 2 minutes, if it misses that they add 2 more minutes, until it actually arrives. The bus can be 30 minutes late and it just keeps telling you 2 minutes. Incredibly useless, especially considering that their busses are never ontime to begin with.",
      "Absolutely sucks. The one redeeming feature is that it shows some options that Gmaps doesn't (and doesn't show some options Gmaps does). Imo, should only be used in conjunction with OneBusAway.",
      "Lately this app has been useless. I try to use the trip planner to go from one address (my work) to another (home) and the plan trip button is greyed out. I close and restart the app and have to enter the addresses all over again. If it starts working as expected, attempting to view the trip on the map crashes the program. This is especially frustrating when one is en-route and the app doesn't remember the last trip. Major debugging needed.",
      "The planner gives good information on all modes of public transpotation unless there are planned reroutes or alerts.As I write this review, there is a parade rerouting at least 5 routes. None of them show an alert with this app. You have to use multiple websites to make make this app accurate or expect to be late to work. Fix the alert and my rating goes to at least 4 stars.",
      "Samsung OS Update Crashes App It used to be useable for me, but once I accepted the recent Samsung software update I no longer am able to even open the app. This isn't the Trip Planner App Devs' fault so much as it is Samsung's. That said, whoever manages the app should make an update. This effects many commuters like myself who use buses to get to work. I do not wish for I or others to have their work or appointments hindered by lacking a reliable bus schedule and route to their destination."

      "Very good app, but missing one feature. There isn't cost split option if you are travelling not alone. For example, traveller 1 paid for meal for himself, traveller 2 and 3, while traveller 4 was not eating. It is really good app and I use it all the time, since most of the time I travel alone, but if I have someone else with me - I need to use different app. One day when you fix it - you will be the best in the market :)",
      "Used it to track my expense for my New York trip last Christmas and it was very easy to use and helped a lot in terms of keeping me on budget. My only dislike is not being able to export the data unless a premium member. Nonetheless a great app highly recommend if you're travelling on a tight budget or you just wanna see how you spent money",
      "I am using the paid version of this and have found it useful, but one thing is frustrating me. I added a category and want to change the icon assigned, but can find no way to do that, or even delete the category I added and re-add it correctly. UPDATE: Thank you very much for your prompt reply. I'm sorry I am so late in letting you know that your suggestion worked perfectly and I have updated my rating from 4 to 5 stars!",
      "I loved using this app to track my spending while travelling. It is easy to use and puts the money in different categories and then allows you to view the break down of your spending. It really makes me accountable when spending abroad and has helped me save money. I love that you can make new trips and set a total budget that automatically sets a daily budget that is then attainable. The free version does have some pop up ads but well worth it to have such a great app for free! Highly recommend",
      "Great App. I am using their free version. And I am 100% satisfied with this app. I make positive impact. And if you are a budget traveller then it is best app for you. To write your day to day expenses. Automatic total calculation helps to find your average daily expense."

You're best bet is to get the apk of the previous version of the app, otherwise searching for tours on your phone will not be worth it. Oh yeah, and the tours I've booked have gone well, this is just a review of the app.",

      "No way to get mobile tickets on iOS or android. In addition, I tried reviewing the tours I took and the app refused to post my review, telling me to try later, then my review is gone and have to type it again. After two trials I have app. One of the worst apps out there!",
      "Sorry to give low rating.... I love Viator, BUT this app is severely lacking... 1) you can search by location OR keyword, not both. If your trip is on Hawaii, and you want to go paragliding, you have to scroll through paragliding in dozens of other places first 2) can't add things to wishlist 3) wishlist can't be divided (e.g. by location when planning multiple trips) 4) setting date of travel should auto populate check availability, yet the ca keeps going to \"tomorrow\" Just a few major things.."

      "Bad app. Useless when traveling. It should have a map like Google maps with all places indicated, filter something and only appear that in the map. The system only allows you to download like cities, but for example when traveling to Bali, we wanted to search places in general, but you can't, you must know in which \" city\" that place is to find it, and normally you don't know that why you are searching. So the best thing would be to have all places for countries or regions, and have a search box",
      "Wow. Used to be great. But now they're charging 5 bucks (4 pounds) to TEMPORARILY ACCESS guidebooks for a month. For anyone reading this, don't throw money out the window! You can buy ANY used guidebook for that price and its yours too keep 😊 alternatively, use a library! Lonely planet, you did have the option to price fairly, but you didn't. Don't @ me.",
      "I used to love this app - it was easy to use, had lots of information, and helped me plan for a number of trips. Now it's a paid-for subscription service, I'll be uninstalling as its no longer fit for purpose for me - the costs aren't worth the amount I use it (despite Lonely Planet's copy and pasted response to all of the other comments that are the same as mine). There are a number of other free resources (which funnily enough includes LP's own website) that I'll continue to use instead.",
      "The app is now not useful at all, since they implemented new ridiculous subscriptions (way overpriced). I'm very disappointed about Lonely Planet. I will not pay that price for subscription, doesn't matter which reason they give. If nothing change I will simply delete the app. We are in 2020, we can find a lot of travel information on the web without having to pay for. It was a great app, before...",
      "Atleast offer a trial run before charging a subscription. I've installed it, and in 2-3 minutes, I'm getting a window to subscribe to \"Must See.\" I mean these information are also available on other site. So why would I pay for something that doesn't even differentiate you. You have got to come up with a better proposition."

      "An extremely buggy and frustrating application. Showed me a \"NullReferenceException\" when I wanted to view the ticket I booked. Don't know what that is, but it's definitely not my ticket. Once I logged in to pay for my ticket, I found at least 5 other card details which weren't mine. Are these there for me to use for free? Are these guys being serious? I login and find other card details already saved!!!???",
      "What a bad app, the customer care is slow and unsatisfactory. Booked a ticket, they debited the amount from my bank and didn't give me a ticket. Repeated calls did not help. They do not pick up the line and do not care about customer's. Move to another app unless you want to be scammed. Should shut down business if you can't handle things. Certainly suing you.",
      "I don't know weather this concerns you or not you app is pathetic and so is your customers care. This is my second booking with you and needed assistant for both of them but didn't get for one. App doesn't have cancellation option for me. Site is not working as well and customer care representative are busy. Well Guess it was my mistake then choosing you app for booking..... Hope this ratings and comment warns you upcoming customer",
      "I have booked flight ticket on 13th March through PayPal gateway. After payment there was no confirmation on the ticket booking and I'm unable to login my account. Worst Customer Care!!! They have two landline numbers and they are always busy. Email service is also equally worst, even after multiple mails there is no proper response at all. Now I'm clueless my money is gone 😔",
      "The app is not updated with the revised rules of cancellation. Tried cancelling my booking through the app but the booking still shows the older process of Liberty insurance under 'how to claim' section Booked a fully refundable ticket by paying Rs 1000 extra but while trying to cancel, the refund amount is only rs 400 instead of 3,800 Customer care no. Has busy tone since morning It's just a hassle to use this app"

When you call on their customer care number they just keep the call transfering from one department to other and if the call gets transfer to the correct department they just give you some lame excuse and no refund received.. Highly frustrated with them.. Instead is good to take some pain and book by yourself..",
      "Worst app! Tried to change my flight and while trying to change it, money was deducted from my account but flight wasn't rescheduled. When I tried to find out what had happened, no one responded appropriately on the call helpline and their so-called support website was of no use and their chat service wasn't of any help. Had to rebook my flight ticket.",
      "Not able to change or cancel flight through app due to corona virus impact imposed in countries. Not able to connect to customer care. Almost tried 6-7 times and was on call for more than 1 hr each time but call not connected and getting disconnected after hour.",
      "Worst app ever! I wanted to reschedule my flight but the app or website did not allow me to reschedule it. Even the customer care service is not picking up my phone and they picked my call on the night of departure only 10 hours left and they are not even try to solve my problem .worst servive mmt. Will definitely file a complaint against you",
      "Worst app for customer service,you just can't connect with them,not on customer care,no revert on emails & chat is just waste of time. Please be careful while booking because God forbid if something happens & u want to cancel or change ur booking be prepared to say goodbye to ur hard-earned money."

    "description":"WallTrip is a FREE travel expense manager - tracker, an essential tool for a budget traveller, to help to manage the travel budget and analyze how much money you are spending in the trip or travel as well as control how much money you still have in the wallet without the need to count money.\r\n\r\nEasily manage your travel budget and travel expense\r\n\r\nSimply inform your travel budget that you can spend in your travel and then register the travel expenses when they happen. We made this as easier as possible in order to let you inform the expenses in just 3 touches, so that you can register your expenses in the moment that you have them and do not need to wait until arrive to the hotel. \r\n\r\nConvert the travel currency to your home currency\r\n\r\nYou can always register which currency you will use in your travel as well as your home currency, for each wallet that you create. For the expenses, incomes, and goals, you will always inform the values in your travel currency, and WallTrip will show you how much you are spending in your home currency.\r\n\r\nCreate as many trip wallets as necessary\r\n\r\nYou can create as many trip wallets as necessary. Use it as a way to also manage different currencies during your trip. For example, if you travel to Russia, Ukraine, Italy, and Brazil, you can create a trip wallet for each of these countries and each one with a different currency.\r\n\r\nOrganize and group your expenses by categories\r\n\r\nWallTrip provides customized categories in order to allow you to track the money usage according to each category.\r\n\r\nSee statistics of your expenses - with charts and tables\r\n\r\nWallTrip provides a series of statistics of your expenses with charts and tables to better let you analyze your spending.\r\n\r\nCreate trip goals to save money\r\n\r\nOne plus of WallTrip is the possibility to create goals and save money for them. How does it work? The idea is simple: you can basically create a goal (e.g., \"dinner in a fancy restaurant\") and inform how much money you want to save for that goal (e.g., 100 U$). The app will block this value from your available money and, as soon as you reach your goal, you need to edit your goal and mark it as achieved, which will make those 100U$ available again. After that, remember to create the real expense related to your goal (e.g., \"94 U$, Dinner at restaurant XYZ\") as soon as you actually have the dinner, so these 94 U$ will be debited from the available money.\r\n\r\nLet WallTrip be your travel expenses tracker and help you in your next trip!\r\n\r\nSupported languages\r\nEnglish\r\nPortuguese (Português)\r\nRussian (Русский)",

For example, if you travel to Russia, Ukraine, Italy, and Brazil, you can create a trip wallet for each of these countries and each one with a different currency.<br><br><b>Organize and group your expenses by categories</b><br><br>WallTrip provides customized categories in order to allow you to track the money usage according to each category.<br><br><b>See statistics of your expenses - with charts and tables</b><br><br>WallTrip provides a series of statistics of your expenses with charts and tables to better let you analyze your spending.<br><br><b>Create trip goals to save money</b><br><br>One plus of WallTrip is the possibility to create goals and save money for them. How does it work? The idea is simple: you can basically create a goal (e.g., &quot;dinner in a fancy restaurant&quot;) and inform how much money you want to save for that goal (e.g., 100 U$). The app will block this value from your available money and, as soon as you reach your goal, you need to edit your goal and mark it as achieved, which will make those 100U$ available again. After that, remember to create the real expense related to your goal (e.g., &quot;94 U$, Dinner at restaurant XYZ&quot;) as soon as you actually have the dinner, so these 94 U$ will be debited from the available money.<br><br>Let WallTrip be your travel expenses tracker and help you in your next trip!<br><br><b>Supported languages</b><br>English<br>Portuguese (Português)<br>Russian (Русский)",

      "Great little app to track your budget whilst away.  I was looking for something that allows to see how much cash I have remaining and this looks like it does the trick.  Will mainly be using it simply for cash but like the ability that I can break that down should I need. I say looks like as I haven't used it anger yet but will soon.  What I would like to see is an item on the summary screen showing what the daily limit is for the remaining budget as well but I think that would need a start and end date to be put on the trip.  Also a desktop widget showing remaining budget/daily limit and the ability to quickly enter an expense (or income) item",

And send myself the data so I have a backup or record elsewhere. But the app itself already fulfills the purpose that I need of recording my spending in a simple way, so for that 5 stars!",

      "This is the most useful travel itinerary planning app I've used without all those useless extras.",
      "Absolutely Amazing! Only been using a few minutes and I love it. It's time consuming to set up but worth it for planning a big trip. If you like to have all the info in front of you for sights you will be seeing and how to get there but want to go digital then this is the app to use. I appreciate it's free and can be used offline with the exception of planning to get to your destination because you need to be online for Google maps, oh using Google maps is another great thing about this app! I can't wait to share my trip plan when I'm done, yet another feature it has! Thanks!",
      "Just started using this because I needed an app to plan my trip without having to book anything yet, and this is perfect! I could map out my days with or without specific timings, plan my budget, share with friends... Superb app. I only hope to be able to find more locations because there's too many specific places that I can't find probably due to them being lesser known spots. Other than that, it's perfect and I might just go pro for it.",
      "Perfect app for all planning and travels. would be 5 star if the distances and transportation mode is able to be selected within the app so users could see at a glance the distance and transportation modes. Google should have acquired you guys to work on their Google Trips! with Google tickets, passes, flights etc. sync to the app via. Gmail would be perfect!!",
      "very easy to use. I would love it more if we could create group or share our travel profile with partner soo they have it on their phone and can look or add whenever and see updates. Id also wish you could link website or google photos instead of screenshoting a must see and then loading it. Money input in US $ would be great. view option button nd see plans in photo version not just text"

Useful to browse routes, learn about connections, make reservations. Many, many rules apply; critical to understand before purchase. App details most of it.",
      "Convenient but Glitchy. It is a must if traveling on Amtrak, but it will often display an outdated trip count for multi-ride passes, 1 out of 10 times ticket purchasing doesn't work, and some days the app will not let either of my two phones login to show the conductor my ticket. Always keep a paper copy on hand or a receipt with the QR code in your email as a backup. But even with those issues, I use it every day and it is great for tracking and using Amtrak on the go.",
      "This app is almost useless unless you know where the train routes go. There's hundreds of stations that don't connect so you have to play a guessing game for hours to attempt to plan a trip.",
      "Terrible. Glitchy. Round trip tickets do not show up. every time I want to use a multi-ride ticket, I have to search through my email, find the number, go back to the app, then search for the ticket. it's insane. Also it doesn't show how many points my account has. That's not really important, but the fact that the app doesn't update from whatever database they have just shows another flaw. Sometimes it crashes without reason, other times it won't let you buy tickets without any error codes.",

I at least wish there's a Miscellaneous/Other category that I can put weird expense types in there. I mean, insurance, which is a default expense type, doesn't really fit into any of the above categories, but it's in transportation. I'll be nice if you can do more than 30 days for multiples for long trips, and it would be even better if you can enter a total budget amount for a type of expense, tell the app the number of days you're traveling and the app breaks down the average for you. It'll also be great if these budgets and real expenses logged can be exported to a spreadsheet or something. Or... even just exported so you can continue recording on another device... I know it says cloud sync is coming soon, but not sure what \"soon\" is."

      "Superb app. You got deals from min 3 agents. You discuss, analyse and choose the best suitable. The attractive thing is that this platform acts as mediator between you and agent so that the trust factor is added on in any deal. Agent won't generally misbehave because TT is watching him... Payment inatallments, tracking and instant update/notification about your installments!! Everything on a single screen... that's also one of the wow things of the app as well as TT. Best exp till date.",
      "Very bad experience with travel triangle. We booked a package with 4 star hotels for our Kerala trip but they provided hotels which are not even worth of 1 star. Just a waste of money. They are simply making profits. Before making the payments we will get multiple calls but during the trip if we get any issue they will not respond.",
      "Poor... We had poor experience when we booked our Himachal trip iN December 2019 when the agent cheated us and booked an inferior Hotel at Manali wheb their invoice indicated a different hotel... We have already complained about this a thousand times a d requested for a refund... Travel Triangle sided with the agent and took thier side... Will never book in your pathetic app again",

      "Dont install the app, these people are frauds, they took away 150000 rupees from my bank account. For which I am having a legal battle with them. This App steels your personal data as well. I have staryed receiving calls from different travel related businesses after installing this app. Uninstall the app and never do business with these fraud people and company."

It's useless if I can't zoom in without seeing pixels instead of fine details. But I also understand that you need to make money, and if everyone gets the free eBook, then you won't make money. But I would GLADLY pay for a high quality eBook. My rating is based on the future I would use the most, and at this point it doesn't meet my expectations."

    "description":"• Play 11 different awesome road trip games\r\n• Keep track of your score with an easy to use score keeper\r\n• Add a little more excitement to an already fun road trip game using our easy game timers \r\n• Use the simple gas trip calculator to find a quick estimate of how much your trip will cost  \r\n\r\nBased on the popular site http://www.TopRoadTripGames.com\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAMES\r\nThese games are outlined in an easy to read article style, with game instruction and variations.   Here are some of the games:\r\n\r\n• The Storyteller\r\n• Spot It Game\r\n• Word Puzzle\r\n• Memory Word Game\r\n• Abc Game\r\n• Name That Tune Game\r\n• Riddle Games\r\n• Slug A Bug (car bounty version)\r\n• Cloud Shapes\r\n• ISpy Games\r\n• More coming soon!  \r\n\r\nWe tried to add most of the popular road trip games currently being played and the more we looked, the more we found.  Expect more games to be added in the future.  In addition to compiling some of the most fun road trip games out there, we tweaked a few of them to make them more family friendly.  The traditional Slug a Bug game is fun the first couple times with your siblings, but when dad plays, arms start to turn colors faster than a 2 week old banana. So to prevent World War 3 on your arms, we have come up with and tweaked many road games that should be fun for the whole family. This includes both the younger and older folks.\r\n\r\nWhile most of these games can be played on the road, they can also be played at home or even while you're sitting in the doctor's office! Either way, these games are simple, easy to play and should provide hours of entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIMERS\r\n\r\nGame Stop Watch and Count Down Timer\r\nGames are fun, they are even more fun when time is taken into the equation.  Game timers are like salt and pepper to your meat and potatoes, they can make a fun game even more fun.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCORE KEEPER (Game Scoreboard)  \r\n\r\nNever dig around for a pencil and paper ever again.  Simply add in the number of players playing and how many points you’re playing too.  Set up a player profiles for later game play.

    "descriptionHTML":"• Play 11 different awesome road trip games<br>• Keep track of your score with an easy to use score keeper<br>• Add a little more excitement to an already fun road trip game using our easy game timers <br>• Use the simple gas trip calculator to find a quick estimate of how much your trip will cost  <br><br>Based on the popular site http://www.TopRoadTripGames.com<br><br><br>THE GAMES<br>These games are outlined in an easy to read article style, with game instruction and variations.   Here are some of the games:<br><br>• The Storyteller<br>• Spot It Game<br>• Word Puzzle<br>• Memory Word Game<br>• Abc Game<br>• Name That Tune Game<br>• Riddle Games<br>• Slug A Bug (car bounty version)<br>• Cloud Shapes<br>• ISpy Games<br>• More coming soon!  <br><br>We tried to add most of the popular road trip games currently being played and the more we looked, the more we found.  Expect more games to be added in the future.  In addition to compiling some of the most fun road trip games out there, we tweaked a few of them to make them more family friendly.  The traditional Slug a Bug game is fun the first couple times with your siblings, but when dad plays, arms start to turn colors faster than a 2 week old banana. So to prevent World War 3 on your arms, we have come up with and tweaked many road games that should be fun for the whole family. This includes both the younger and older folks.<br><br>While most of these games can be played on the road, they can also be played at home or even while you&#39;re sitting in the doctor&#39;s office! Either way, these games are simple, easy to play and should provide hours of entertainment.<br><br><br>THE TIMERS<br><br>Game Stop Watch and Count Down Timer<br>Games are fun, they are even more fun when time is taken into the equation.  Game timers are like salt and pepper to your meat and potatoes, they can make a fun game even more fun.  <br><br><br>THE SCORE KEEPER (Game Scoreboard)  <br><br>Never dig around for a pencil and paper ever again.  Simply add in the number of players playing and how many points you’re playing too.  Set up a player profiles for later game play.  There is an auto sort feature in the scoreboard that will always show you the leading players.  Playing road trip games has never been easier!<br><br><br>THE JUST FOR FUN NICETIES<br><br>Road Trip Gas Calculator<br>Why?  Because it’s cool.

I had my most prized possession. My piggy. I was on my way to golden piggy. Then I lost everything. I logged in. I had no stars. No birds. It was like I had never played. I'm honestly so sad. I burst into tears and am disappointed, depressed and overall just so sad that this has happened.",

Further more, if you find a deal, plan on 3x that price because this is all false advertising. I've even tried options that would give the lowest price advertised and I don't know where they're making theses prices up because the most basic options don't give the price the advertised.

      "Latest update crowds screen has complicated the simplicity of the app. Now more money grabbing by creator to silver line pockets for driving features. Pay to remove ads one thing but now taking away a free feature and charging to have it in the app is shameful, you creators are just turning into Trucker Path mentality",
      "Great service to plan your trip with! As for improvement, it could get speed limits and traffic info from maps, and allow you to select additional area's that concern you.",
      "I really like the app's ability to show weather forecasts for the time I'm supposed to be driving through a city. I do wish it allowed me to block out certain driving times (I'm not going to be on the road at 3 in the morning) or would allow me to bound the departure or arrival time a bit. (I plan to leave during the weekend but not today.)",
      "Not only can you see current forecast along route, but you can also run the start time up a day or more and check the forecasts along your route for the entire trip or for each hourly waypoint along the route. Also great for RVs in that you can set your speed and select truck driving mode which is sensitive to winds.",
      "Easy to use accurate information and you can set it for your 10 hr dot and reset breaks along route. To actively deside where you will be better off and not get stuck with a road closure. Wind warning have been on point too for high profile vehicles. I actively use this app winter months for my Trucking business. Outstanding job. Let me know if you need any beta testing."

      "Used to play Delicious on PC & loved every series. Installed this game on Galaxy tab & though is Delicious it seems glitchy & difficult to manuver. Also click play a level, watch the advert but after advert sometimes click play it takes me to yet another advert. Game itself a bit overdone with added task & no explanation on how to complete or the meaning of or help for particular task making it impossible to advance level. 3 star due to other Delicious PC games played otherwise 2 star.",

So if I use this app to record the trip of a lifetime my record of the trip is entirely at the whim of the company behind the app. An export function of some sort is a requirement for anything more than superficial use. It's useful to share with friends and family close to the time of your trip but not to document your memories.",
      "Really great app for saving all your memories, you can record your treks on the map, navigate, add images/video, voice and notes. I liked the live sharing feature. You can also discover sites and explore them. I really enjoy this app, and it keeps improving all the time.",

      "this ad sucks pop out my screen each minute",
      "Update 1: Had some issues with the app at the beginning but after emailing the support team of WishTrip, they found out there was a bug but they managed to rectify the problem quickly. They also explained carefully how to use the system as I misuderstood some of the app features. Now it seems better and perfect especially knowing that I can also access my account in a web browser and its potential for my future treks. Thanks"

      "!!!! they cheat!!! Don't you use myTrip exactly. I wanted to cancel my flight, I sent a message to mytrip and then they canceled. But they said me, we will never return the money. If you do not come back my money, why cancel the ticket. After again i called to them if so you will not come back my money I want to use ticket then myTrip said to me\" we canceled your ticket you don't fly. \" If you wouldn't come back to my money, I was going to use that ticket. I was going to fly. I don't recommnd",
      "I've been using this app for the last four year's trips, and it is so convenient having flights, and car reservations, and hotel reservations easily accessible on the fly. I also enjoy the ability to make notes and essentials lists, as well as itineraries that can easily be edited as the need arises. One small gripe is that I upgraded so as to make the data available on my wife's phone, but when I changed phones, I lost that ability. One improvement I would suggest would be more categories for event/ location details. I think this would especially be helpful for business users. Another might be adding GPS info to the locations database. Just a thought...Oh yeah! And make it sync to your laptop! And be able to add a photo with each itinerary location or event!",
      "Great app. Has all the features I need without trying to sell me tickets like other apps. It just needs to add a terminal space for departure since this is also important",
      "Flight from Auckland to San Fransisco not accepted as flight lands in San Fransisco before it leaves Auckland. This is due to crossing date line and going back a day. Fix that and I'll reinstall and have another go."

      "Editing my previous review. I haven't used this app for long, but recently have discovered a massive glitch. It's tedious to make profile changes, cos the changes don't get properly saved. I have shifted to another place, literally 1000 kms away in another country, and yet I cannot update my home address. No matter what, the changes are \"saved\" but they are never \"stored\" and hence jump back to the previous address almost immediately.",
      "Couchsurfing really has a great potential to have an amazing positive impact on the way you travel and maybe even see life. As long as you keep one thing in mind: at the start it is frustrating that you won't get anywhere without having reviews and being verified. But it is free to get verified if you host someone. Once you have been verified and gotten a review it will be easy to find a couch. It really makes sense actually as it is supposed to be a two way system.",
      "I want to edit my review and dis-rate the app now because a big problem I have noticed with this app which I don't receive any notification shows that I received a message from someone unless I go to my inbox and check myself and which can be after so many days because I don't keep in my mind that I have to check my inbox all the time because it has to be automatically. According to me, it's a huge mistake and am very sure that all the people are facing the same problem. Hope you work on it..!!",
      "I get no notifications at all. My changed in the profile are not getting updated and saved. I can not upload more than one picture for some weird reason. Everytime I go to a screen I get this notification of agreeing to share data- how many times do I really need to tap on that? The app is too slow, it takes forever to load."

      "Buggy backup. I really liked the app at first as there are ample options to customize items and add categories. Being able to add custom bags is nice, although the app added several copies of the same bag. But when my phone crashed and I tried to get back my data, I got back my list, but not the content. I tried to send several emails to the developer to resolve the issue, but didn't get a response.",
      "Frustrating!!! I paid money for this app thinking that it would save all of my lists. I added a Vacation list of 143 items or so and when I went back into the app to add more items, everything was lost and I had to start from scratch. There was no retrieval of it. I re-entered the list, went back in a few days later to add a few more items and same thing again - I lost everything. Wrote to the seller, never heard a response....terrible app! Waste of money and time!!!",
      "Biggest problem for me with all these packing apps is that they come pre-configured with literally hundreds of items under sections that I will never ever use. As such I look for apps that allow me to edit Categories and the items in them so that when I select 'Beach' or whatever I only have to scroll through the items that I might normally take, not the 200 items I won't. Couldn't find a way to do this even with the paid version so, refund and delete. Far quicker to write a list out with pen and paper.",
      "Very helpful app! Easy to customize to your specific needs. This will help you remember all of the essentials for your trip as well as helping you to not overpack. Once you compile your list, you can generate a shopping list of all the items that you need to purchase.",
      "Probably the best packing list app I've ever tried. Being able to choose the items you need from a predetermined list is an excellent way to prevent forgetting important items or having to remove a large amount of items that don't fit your lifestyle. I definitely recommend this app for anyone who has difficulty packing or simply wants to make the process more efficient."

      "Mostly awesome...I just wish the menu was easier to navigate. For example, when I open the app and I have a flight THAT DAY, it should be the first thing I see (i.e. You have a flight today! Here's the details etc) instead of having to look all over the app for my confirmation number when I'm at the airline kiosk. Other than this, it's a stellar booking app",
      "This app is good for monitoring flights but if they want more people to use it to actually book their flights, they have ALOT of work to do. Customer service is terrible. If something changes with your flight and you need to talk to someone, GOOD LUCK. Response times take weeks and theres no actual phone number you can call to talk to someone. They need to hire more staff to manage the large chat volumes, or get an actual call center. I will never be using the app again to book my flights.",
      "There app charges double / doesn't find the best deal. Booked montreal to Miami for May and app said $500 was good and to book. When I did a simple Google search, I found the EXACT same flight for half the price. I thought Hopper was supposed to give us the best deals, I guess not. Last time I'll be using the app to book a flight.",
      "I also use Google's tracker & find it more reliable since it'll email me almost everyday when prices have changed. So to my surprise when Google told me the lowest price, I was disappointed that hopper didn't send me notifications. I had to open the app to find out they also agreed it was the lowest time to buy. Another unfortunate thing is that they don't have an option for which class u want, unlike Google. I still have this app around to compare prices, but didn't use it to buy our flights",
      "Nothing but confusion. I booked my trip a week ago and have had minimal communication. Trying to contact customer support is near impossible. They have no telephone numbers. Currently experiencing a full on nightmare trying to book a trip. 0/10 do not book with this app. Should have went with Expedia my God."

      "Super useful and easy to read UI to find transit routes. There is a JR option to search for routes and you can view the timetable incase you miss your train. I have also showed the routes provided by this app to employees to reserve Shinkansen tickets.",
      "Overall a very helpful app that provides detailed instructions and routes. Very useful for those with a JR pass since it indicates which suggested routes are JR only. One suggestion would be to improve how ticket prices are indicated; it can be confusing at times to figure out the exact fare required for a trip that requires transfers.",
      "Easy to use and very informative, really helped plan our trip.",
      "Great app for route planning with the JR pass. Could show more info when you search.",
      "Extremely useful and well done app. Everyone who is traveling to Japan should have it installed."

      "This app makes it so eazy to book last minute attractions and plan yor trip. The mobile vouchers are awesome and the prices are decent, most of it is cheeper than trip advisor! I used this app for my study abroad semester and i booked all kinds of stuff in lots of different countries.",
      "Very good and easy to understand . I use GYG.. everywhere I go.. I've had full refunds on cancelled bookings..You can reschedule your tour times and dates without any issues.. Highly recommended. Reputable and reliable tour operators and guides, knowledgeable with detailed historical and modern informative. Good with time keeping on pick up and drop off .. GYG customer service is excellent.. I love this app ❤️",
      "Misleading trip in Rome. They sold me tickets for the Colosseum and advised to download them and go straight in. Only to then be told AT THE ENTRANCE that you have to collect them away from the Colosseum, about 10/15 mins away. I cannot stress enough that people do NOT use this app, I paid 30€ only for a trip and ticket I couldn't use.",
      "Booked and paid for a trip through this site and then when we turned up there was no record of our booking. A wasted journey and still haven't received a refund.",
      "When we arrived for our tour, the tour guides had us down for the March when we booked for February. Not what you want when you're planning a weekend away! However the staff where great and we got to go on the tour, the tour guide Maggie was fab well worth the trip. However I will be booking direct with the host in future, we have another tour booked tommorow so hopefully we don't have the same issue!"
