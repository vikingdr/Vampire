      "This was the best. Since I've had my Note 10+, about a month, this app was working great. Why did you have to ruin it? While there was room for improvement, the new channel listing stinks. In portrait, the picture shrinks to a ridiculously small thumbnail, if you want to browse through the list while watching something else. Show info is gone. Often,the list is mostly blank. But worst... the show's are constantly buffering. Thanks for breaking what really didn't need fixing.",
      "Latest update looks nice, but it's missing a key feature and the usability has decreased. (1) Favorites are missing. (2) Vertical categories requires more scrolling and tapping than the useful horizontal menu. (3) Last channel viewed is not remembered after closing and reopens to a different channel. (4) Picture-in-picture no longer works. Despite these issues, this is still my favorite TV app.",
      "I definitely don't like the updated version of the Pluto TV at all. It takes too long to start. It doesn't restart on the previous channel that you watched. I can't change the channel like the older version. I have to turn off the Pluto TV to get to a station that I like. I'm thinking about uninstalling the Pluto TV app. It doesn't list the shows anymore on the updated version. What happened to the Wahlburgers TV Show in the 300s channel? Overall I'm Very Much Disappointed in the updated version",
      "Newest update turns itself on despite force closing it repeatedly. That is UNACCEPTABLE from a streaming app. Your privacy policy reads like the former Soviet Union's bill of rights. There aren't any, you mine horrifying amounts of very personal data (name, ph number, email, home address, etc) and give full access to multiple 3rd parties. Want my ss # and bank PIN too?!?",
      "Worked great until it updated, use to load up fast and not freeze, now it lags, the color guide was better than the black and white guide now, pictue is clear I must say, I know it's free, but if it's not broke, don't fix it. I do recommend this app for an alternative to watch tv on the go."

      "I'll state my couple of drawbacks first to get those out of the way. Not all movies have captions, so options for the hard of hearing community are more limited. Lots of amateur movies, or flat out corny, particularly among sci fi, so if you don't like that there's that. That being said, many great movies are on here. It's accessible via computer or phone, super easy to navigate. Suggested options aren't repetitive. Ads are short, and allow for the best part. It's free",
      "I've just installed this and am about to watch my first movie on it. 5 stars for being free and transparent about how this app works...ie...ads. Given the current state of things with COVID-19 it's great to have this app to pass the time. I've only briefly glanced at the movie selection, but I'd like to see more current titles in the future. Lots appear to be old movies and/or ones I've never heard of. Hopefully I can leave my review at 5 stars after I've had more time to utilize it.",
      "Little specific complaints, but here's a few. Unique movies, nothing wrong with this just aren't my jam. I wanted to watch the film Rango, as shown in 2 of the images of the app, and it didn't have it, tad annoyed. Good interface Few ads Its free! I mean theres a chance I won't keep this forever but this is worth it as you lose nothing. Would recommend, 8/10",
      "Only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because you can't find \"common\" shows. Alot of \"knock-offs\". But it's free so can't complain too much. There's ads as if you're watching TV, but the app has to get paid somehow right? So long as we don't find out later that they steal or sell info, I don't have much to complain about. Will continue to use it till they run out of shows!",
      "I rated 4 stars bc nothing in life is %100 perfection. Everything's going to have a flaw.....the only issue here is the same as any other viewing platform is that there are ads . Eventhough ads are necessary, there are only a couple spots throughout a full show where ad commercials popped up. They were quick and painless! Great app.....love it....will keep it!! 🤘🤘"

      "I love this app! Yes, it has commercials during the tv shows but you can watch a lot of shows shown on tv/cable the very next day on this app. You can go back in time and watch some old shows you use to love and have forgotten about. For example, I found and have been watching \"The Six Million Dollar Man\". There are movies, investigative report shows, news reports...you name it, you can probably see it. This app is definitely worth trying!",
      "This app gives me any news feed I may want! Thank you for the hard work! Well done! I'm changing my review of your app. Why? Because every news channel runs fine except FOX NEWS the entire reason i got the app. You are intentionally interrupting it and or slowing it down. Ive recorded it with my other devices to show any and everyone who my want to see it! Im going to share that info with my chat buddies and FOX NEWS! Such a shame you were doing realy well for the first month!",
      "I appreciate the variety of shows offered. I am not a sports or political enthusiasts but this app isn't all about just those. I don't mind the ads, they are not excessive and they have not played during a video clip. Ads is what keeps apps free and I find things I wouldn't normally know existed; they also give my eyes a break when I don't want to shut down. This Free TV app also don't put spyware or extra hidden apps or files on your device (at least any that I have found) that take up memory",
      "Needs some major work on the Chromecast. I have to go to the Google Home app & select which device I want (I have 2 Chromecasts). Then I have to go to the Freecable TV app & select which show I want to watch. I have to make sure my phone is horizontal & not vertical. My phone can't snooze (to save battery life) or it quits playing in the TV. Fix these problems & I'll give 5 stars.",
      "This app is much bigger than Pluto TV, I like the entire concept of the way it's been shown to me, it has a huge amount of news, entertainment, movies, updates classic TV shows and I also enjoy the clips from the latest episodes, to say this is a must have app is more like a must keep app! Thank you very much!!!👍🍿👍🍿🎬"

      "Nice but very pricey! Is it worth $54 a month? Let's see, there are commercials throughout the movies. Playback on week old sitcoms like American Idol are loaded with ads that you are not allowed to skip! The cool thing are all the available movies, old shows, new shows, live entertainment, oh wait, there are TV apps that do the same thing BUT THEY ARE FREE!!!",
      "I love this app! We are able to look up movies and tv shows and add them to our list so easily. If we want to catch up on our shows, no problem. They have them. The only thing is I wish it was less in cost. When I first signed up it was a really good deal. They then added more channels and went up on their price because of that. Unstandble, but I wasnt given the choice if I wanted the new channels and the price increase. So, to help with cost, I have to go back to cable. Not what I wanted.",
      "Hands down best streaming app out there!! We had sling TV first, then tried Philo TV. Then went back to sling TV. We were not happy with sling TV because they have too many issues to get worked out. Too many glitches. Since we got YouTube TV we could not be more satisfied. No glitches at all!! We like having a regular guide to pull up to see what we want to watch, YouTube TV has that. We cut the cord and haven't been happy until we got YouTube tv!!!!! Need more space to write. We love it!!!!!!!!",
      "Decent service for the money but way too many sports channels. At least we get local news channels, unlike HULU, which gave us news channels based on our wifi location not our physical location. Only other drawback is that when you delete a recording it doesn't remove it from your list until 9 months after the record date. Definitely beats paying the high price of cable.",
      "Not a great service. It held lots of promise, on which YouTube has fallen short. Overall,not a great interface. Then, when you find something and it happens to be not subscribed from your local area, you get way to many ads, often for the same product (using exactly the same as), in the same commerical break segment. I tried it for almost a year, and I'm cancelling it. Don't waste your money on YouTube TV."

I like using the app on my Chromebook at times and in rooms where I don't have a TV, but what's the use if I can't access the channels I wish to watch that are on my service level?",
      "Beyond horrible. -5 stars. Slow loading. Constant errors of several types. Channels won't load even after cache clean & reboot etc. It's worse after every update. Never gets better. Spectrum sucks but this app is even worse. Can't wait for fiber optic and streaming so I can watch Spectrum burn to the ground. The single worst service and app ever. Just don't!",
      "This app used to work perfect for me. Loved it last year. Until I did the app update it required last month on my phone. Since then this app does NOT WORK at all. I've contacted them to report it, & reinstalled the app. & No results from both. Let's get this app fixed, Spectrum. Or you may lose a customer.",
      "My ability to cast just flat disappeared. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Still nothing. Just when I think charter does something decent, it ruins itself. And sadly the charter email on the internet is literally the worst I've ever seen. Sooooooooooooo slow. Working it on my phone is 10 times faster than an actual CPU. Junk",
      "App is garbage. It's constantly freezing and buffering. I have deleted and re downloaded multiple times and I've upgraded as well. It's still trash. Can't seem to even get past the black page that says spectrum. It just freezes rt there constantly Edit march 9th- have deleted and re downloaded numerous times this issue never seems to be fixed. I have 5g and 2g and it happens on both. Edit march 11th- is still not loading. Not a problem with Wi-Fi, using 5g and 2g...when will this issue be fix BS"

I would request any help or support here",

When setting the settings to Auto it tries to go into 1080p but the picture is then devided in 4 squares with 4 seperate outputs of 480p. Could yu please look into this ?",
      "Needs Work - Please add support for the integrated channels feature in Android TV. Would love to see multiple channels added for Library, Live TV, and Recommendations. YouTube TV on Android TV should feel like a native product/integration, not third party. The interface could also use a scale feature to reduce the interface size and allow more content to be displayed.",

      "This program still stutters on HIsense Android TV.  Tech support says that it isn't compatible with the TV, but this obviously is meant to be compatible since the list of devices indicates it is.    The picture stutters badly, jittery, choppy, freezing and unwatchable.  January upgrade did not fix anything.  This was reported in early December in comment below.  480p is not a reasonable option.    YouTube TV on Roku to same TV using same connection method at same time works flawlessly, but why buy an Android TV to use the Roku?  There should be an immediate fix or make sure that it is recognized as incompatible.  Also, watching YouTube TV on Chromecast Built-in has the same issues."

      "A very nice app in the free streaming service category. It has a very good selection for my age demographic. I am, however, only giving 4 stars because it lacks one feature for use on my device: there is no way to clear the \"Continue Watching\" feature. Sometimes you may begin a movie or show that you don't want to continue (because you've changed your mind once it began). How do you clear that feature? Please fix this and I'll gladly add the final star.",
      "Interface is fine for a free streaming app. 8 commercials per movie is tolerable considering how, again, it's free. That being said, is it really too much to ask that I'm able to enjoy what I'm streaming? The ads conveniently play perfectly every time. The movie/TV part however, not so much. My screen kept freezing as audio continues to play and then turns green. This happened several times within the first 20 minutes of just one movie. I'm sorry, but that makes it unbearable to watch.",
      "Seemed to be okay at first my first time watching a movie, that is until I experienced the ads. I'm not opposed to some ads by any means, it is free after all. The problem is they run choppy, sometimes out of sync with voice. The time doesn't match up. It will go back to the movie for 3 seconds, then go back to the ads all over again as if I hadn't watched the ads at that interval yet. After what was supposed to be like 1 minute of ads to continue watching, I was really at 3 or 4 minutes.",
      "I love the variety of movies & shows. They have regular, but not too many commercials. But this site does need work. When watching a tv show you cant easily get to the next episode. When opening the app at another time it will start the series over from the beginning instead of the next episode. It doesn't really let you make a list of shows & then get to that list. I am looking forward to improvements & an update.",
      "ZERO STARS. I tried watching movies on CRACKEL but VOLUME LEVEL WAS SO LOW~ ~>Icouldnt even HEAR THE MOVIE enough to tell what was going on. Maddening!. I used the closed captioning because I am severely hearing-impaired CLOSED CAPTIONING. It's not enough I can hear well enough to watch movies other apps! If that wasn't enough when the ads came on it blasted me out of my seat and I had to move my phone over 2 feet away from ME it was SO DARN LOUD! If you're handicapped, I highly advise against"

      "I am having a lot of problems with this app ! There are a lot of advertisements !! The ads start about 2 seconds after you start watching a program !! They keep on and on !! When you close them out it reloads the program you were watching back to the beginning !! I can not watch a full episode of my most favorite program !! I have tried everything and nothing works !! Please help !!",
      "Poor service, a lot of ads, almost every ad u have to restart app , doesn't pick up where u left off at & won't let u finish watch 1/2 hr shows! Well got told that there was issues with a release that they had earlier in the week & that they issued an update & for me update to latest version . I did that & now when there is an ad the movie/ show starts at the beginning instead of where it left off at, not sure what to do??",
      "Just downloaded but I have to say I'm impressed how easy and quick it was and the amount of really good American TV shows and movies is very good. I'm definitely glad I found it and gave it a try. Right now it's 4 stars but I'll do an update in a month or two. I'd like to see Travel channel, Discovery channel, Sifi channel in there at some time. Great job off to a good start!",
      "This is GREAT I LOVE IT ! I understand why you put ads in it but too many ads spoil the shows , if you are going to put alot of ads in it at least put them on the top of the screen so we can still watch the shows without being interrupted, other than that I would recommend this app to everyone, I love documentaries and paranormal, , Keith Taylor Ashland Kentucky",
      "Don't waste your time. About one minute into a show, a commercial begins. You can X that out after 5 seconds, but there's another commercial right after that. And then when you X that out, it goes back to the app, but the app is paused. You have to reopen the app. By that time, you've missed at least a half-minute of the show and say, \"The heck with it,\" and you uninstall the app."

Support page requires attaching a file but no way to include any files even there is none, and field to add a file does not work so there is no way to add a file anyway.

One TV I own (Sony 4k Smart) It just will not work on. This Sony uses Android OS and the Google Play Store for apps. I can go right in and pull up Xumo for android tv's, install the app, but when i open the app. It will pull up just like it should then all of a sudden it closes. I have uninstalled, ✓'ed p'missions on tv. Idk? Anyone??",
      "Won't play entire movie. It worked okay at first, but lately everytime I try to watch a movie or show it won't let me. As soon as I pick a channel it shows the first part, then it shows an ad, and then it starts over again. It keeps doing that that until it's time for the next movie. Then it starts doing that with the next movie. So you never get to actually see the show you wanted to watch in it's entirety.",

It's got some awesome shows and movies I want to watch but Everytime I go to watch something,an ad starts playing in the middle of the show and then the show starts from the beginning all over again.

      "For the app being free with no cable required this is a pretty good app. Lots of reviews are saying that there are too many ads, but personally I don't mind the amount of ads. Plus in regular tv you get commercials anyway so the ads aren't really a problem. The only problem I do have is that parts of episodes in shows are skipped. For example in one show the first 2 episodes were fine but after the middle of the third ep. the skips were VERY frequent and that takes away a big chunk of the plot.",
      "I love that I can now watch every episode of Days of our lives in this app! However, the things that I dislike the most while watching shows/movies more than anything else in the world is commercials and there are 2-7 commercials every 4 mins while trying to watch the show. You can't fast forward or skip them at all and I hate that but otherwise this is a good app! The picture is great and it's almost always perfect never splotchy!!!",
      "Overall I find the application to be quite good, but a big fault would have to be the fact that live broadcast, such as NBC Nightly News takes so long to actually become available. I have other channel apps, which show the last broadcast, just moments after the live feed is complete and I even have my local NBC affiliate app, which broadcast the news live, as it's being shown on television. Waiting for the next day, to be able to watch the news, now more than ever is shocking.",
      "Why have \"locked\" content when you can go to hulu and watch the same show. I binge watched a whole season of law & order svu all the way up to the most recent episode in which you all locked the most recent episode. And you play the same ads over and over. With hulu I pay a few extra dollars for no ads. **UPDATE** New problem. I started watching New Amsterdam on the app. The \"continue watching\" shows episodes I watched already. Hulu does not have season 1.",
      "Major networks putting out apps that function so poorly that its a nuisance to use baffles me. This one, in particular, has shows that are tv originals (in other words, designed for commercial breaks) that break for commercial at the wrong time--even mid-opening theme song. It even returned to the theme song after the commercials....Seriously? Commercial breaks mid-sentence. Like an amateur Youtube video. Love the dreaded black screen that is \"buffering\". Yet Netflix plays flawlessly."

      "I don't get it... I have had Sling for a few years and have never had any issues until recently. Anytime I watch anything it constantly freezes up and goes to the buffer wheel and then it will eventually just black out the screen. This has happened on multiple devices with different internet connections. I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no resolution to the problem. All other streaming apps Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon work great, it's definitely a Sling problem. Hard pass. Do not reco",
      "More updates, sometimes we make it through a commercial break. Even after a couple of updates, now I can't stream at all. Yikes, one awful step backwards. Updated to new version, now some times we can stream past a group of commercials, but basically it has the same problems Chromecasting. Shows constantly go black during commercials while simultaneously jumping to the beginning of the show. It isn't fun watching the beginning of a show over and over with no option to resume.",
      "I really like it. Much better than hulu which I just canceled and half the price. More user friendly! So much easier to record and find shows. My favorite, when my screen times out while paused, when I open it back up it comes on with whatever I was watching and starts playing. With Hulu that would've taken at least 4 more clicks. Only had it a week and I wish I would've changed alot sooner.",
      "Horrible app. I've used this app on my android phone, on Roku TVs and on the Amazon Firetv box. The app crashes and freezes on every device. Customer service says it's my internet connection, which isn't the case. My internet works just fine with a 100mbs signal and I have a full 4G LTE signal on my phone when it malfunctions. And the app is always updated. Time to switch to a different service. I don't recommend this app.",
      "Paid and seen that the same stuff is on Pluto for free. Talked to someone on chat 5 minutes after signing up and no refunds. Now I tried to get on it this morning and its telling me to update my subscription and asking for 30.00 more. Hell no. So at this point I cant watch any thing. Waiting for customer service to open up to ask why and it's also telling me it cant support my tv. Hum rip off scam. No local channels either."

I would like to give you 5 stars if you fix this. I am updating the app! Nice friend of the app, Jesus * Edit 2 Question! Do you have a radio app or eas radar?",

      "I just downloaded this abc app a couple hours ago on my Hydrogen Red and so far it's working perfectly. I've paused a few times and switched between 'windows'. The program I'm watching remained and is playing smoothly even with commercials. Granted, I would rather the commercials be at the end so I can enjoy the commercials and the show without interruptions. I do enjoy commercials just not during my show. I love the ability to access and engage in the programs I'm so fond of. Thank You",
      "Love the shows but the app stinks. It never starts up where the episode left off. Will \"play\" ads but not show them and when the show comes back on its further into the episode than it should be. I'm constantly having to go out and come back in and guess the closest spot to play episode again without triggering the ads again. Even though I have to do that with EVERY commercial break. Its extremely frustrating.",
      "It used to work fine. Since Jan/Feb 2020 it's been acting up. Telling me my area is not supported when I'm in Cali. I've restarted the app, my phone, and /or reinstalled the app sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. And yes, I did send an email through the app for help and it still not working.",
      "Not impressed with this app at all. Abc is one of the biggest networks but you can't even watch live TV on the app (at least in my area). It also often is difficult with watching shows, if you try to skip to a certain spot it always starts you at the beginning of the segment all over again. There's also many times errors that come up when I try to watch something.",
      "I think its great. Could use a little less commercials. But very happy to have the opportunity to use it. Otherwise I would'nd get to watch my favorite ABC episodes. My work hours keeps me from watching regular air time. So I play catch up on the weekends. Thank you ABC !"

I've uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared all data, deleted the app completely, turned my phone off and on, checked internet still all it does is buffer. 10 minutes and hasn't even got 15 seconds into a show. Horrible",

      "This app deserves ALOT more than 5 stars. You can never find any disney shows or movies on Youtube, and this app has it all!! Full seasons, episodes, movies etc! And every episode, you get 1-2 ads. I'm not saying that's good, but it's not bad. I would TOTALLY recommend this app for people who don't have it yet!😀😀",
      "I actually used this app before and it was... Still bad, but now I can't even watch the Tangled series which is the entire reason I redownloaded it. I entered my provider and it's still being stupid. Just add the rest of this mess to Disney+. There are even episodes missing between Disney+ and Now from the Big Hero 6 series. I'd rather you just be money hungry with + instead of being infuriating with the small stuff that's supposedly free. You're Disney, you never try to make people upset. :(",
      "This app is Amazing, but I hate that you have to have a TV provider to watch a Lot of things, This is a problem for people who don't have a TV provider, And many of My family members including me are upset about this, I would rate the app Five stars, if this feature Was Removed, But Other than that, The app is pretty good,",
      "This is a really bad game and i would put a negative 1 because you need to put in your tv provider put the dum thing is that some people dont have to put in their email but others do. When i put it in, it says prossesing error even if i have a lot of internet. It would be a good game but this is a real problem for me. Please fix this!",
      "I don't know how I should feel about this app. It has stuff I couldn't find on the Disney+ app which is a good thing but... Having only 2 episodes of Pokemon or just a handful of episodes for a lot of the shows here makes me want to go to the Disney+ app. I suggest either putting full seasons on here or focus more on disney+. For what it is this isn't a bad app just it lacks the content to make it worth it. I don't even know of anything here worth keeping this app. Maybe tangled... But that's it"

      "While it's convenient to access content on your phone, this app is awful. It's horribly slow, even when doing simple things like bringing up channel listings or episode descriptions. Takes forever to load, and often loses the stream. It's much easier to go through the app or site of a specific network instead. A lot of channels are unavailable when you're not at home, and it doesn't even recognize when you are home. And you can't cast to another device! Way to screw customers over Xfinity!",
      "I do not like the inability to search by channel. If I want to know what is on a specific channel I may have to scroll through hundreds of channels to get the one that I want and then see what is on from there. Instead I would like the ability to type the channel number in the search window and immediately jump to it instead of scrolling.",
      "This app and X1 sucks ass. You won't reconnect my internet modern at home because of this BS not so easy plan. Been without internet for a week. Can't use the Roku app connected via Mobile Hotspot to my phone. Can't pull it up on my phone and mirror it to my TV. Mean while my recordings keep mounting and I can't watch them. Not to mention that the remind and fast forward are horrible as the time moves but not the picture.",
      "Zero Stars! Stinks! Why doesn't this app work as well as NETFLIX ???Now with slightly less lagging, skipping and looping, all at no extra charge, even while in my home and connected to WI FI! Horrible performance! Very, very slow app. constantly looping and skipping! does a great job of providing consistent commercial breaks!! Go Xfinity !!",
      "Best On the go Experience. You can review DVR content. You can set your DVR you can watch TV remotely. You can download and watch progress instead of using your data. Like the commercial says don't be fooled by FiOS. I tried FiOS twice regretted it both times and could not wait untill my two year period was over."

So For example if I am on my back porch I can press play and my kids show will start. It's also really cool that you can stream the roku channel on your device with the app. I'm still kicking myself for buying a replacement remote last year before I knew about this app. It's so easy to use my three-year-old uses it to control his TV. Don't change a thing!",
      "It's great when it works, the private listening feature is particularly useful and just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it's buggy as hell and does not work most of the time. With private listening on the audio will often lag and sputter so much that eventually my phone will disconnect from the tv. No problems with connectivity when private listening is off, but that feature is basically my only use for the app. Sometimes sputtering audio will keep playing long after the video's paused.",
      "If I could make use out of the private listening feature it would have been a 5 star rating for sure! I can't seem to figure out how to use it and if I even can use it in the way I hoped to use it. At night when my family is sleeping and I don't want to bother them with the TV volume too loud I thought that I could nix that problem with the private listening feature but doesn't seem to work that way. Without that 1 issue 5 stars would be there without question!😞"

      "Hulu live TV no ads it's a joke, every show I tried to watch has commercials. I cancelled, then resubscribed to get Hulu no ads for $11.99 a month, most all of the shows are actually commercial free. The only problem is the library is limited. ABC, NBC, and FOX shows are great with no ads. They have the current episodes, as well as classic TV shows. You have to wait until 2 am the next day to watch new episodes. You can watch General Hospital after 5pm the same day, which is cool .",
      "Hulu is great when it works, but that's only sometimes. The app is laggy and slow, plenty of weird errors, sometimes it just refuse to start. Poor customer service, almost no feedback when something goes wrong which is often. LiveTV crash or just refuse to work, and more commercials than you expect to see, especially if you pay for \"Hulu (No Ads)\" Will be looking elsewhere. I spend more time watching the free streaming services more, just because I'm sick of fighting with Hulu to get it to work correctly.",
      "Always something to watch and great selection. Just when you think you've watched everything you could possibly watch they come out with a new series or new movie. My favorite are the Hulu Originals those are some of the best TV shows the movies I've seen yet. I watch Hulu on a regular basis probably about oh I'd say an hour or two a day every day of the week and I'm still finding new stuff I've never run out not to mention they have way better programming than Netflix. So yes I like my Hulu.",
      "Love this app. Beat the area cable company by a mile. Always something to watch and the DVR is amazing. Just one problem the past few days. It has started to buffer a lot. Thought it might be a device cleaning issue. But cleaning doesn't help. Hoping the new update will take care of this. Other than that, I love this.",
      "Every update stops working. Somehow when you go to Hulu help it is always your device that is supposedly the problem. Every other streaming service works just fine oily problem is Hulu. Now if I travel I have to connect to my home network. Seriously, the idea of me paying for a streaming service is so I could login and use it on my tablet or computer while traveling. Price keeps going up and service keeps getting worse. Too many other services out now to stay with Hulu."

It will either play smoothly but is extremely pixelated, or is crystal clear but freezes up about every minute or two. I talked to support and they said that it's because i didn't add a service provider. And to try watching on the web site. It still does the same thing. I have 6+ other apps with no providers and they play great. They refuse to fix this.",
      "Video quality is poor compared to other streaming apps. In addition it keeps trying to abandon my show and force me to watch 'Coronavirus Now'.",
      "Buffering and poor quality streaming is a major problem in this app. It is not a matter of carrier or type of phone. I have tried in different phones and also friend's different carriers. The problem is definitely with the Fox Now app. I like watching many Fox programs. However this app does not allow me to enjoy any of the programs"

      "I have to say that I really have enjoyed Star Trek Picard and Discovery, but I have an issue that needs attention please. We need a way to access the \"Full screen\" mode. Laptops are not like televisions, so the \"widescreen\" mode you have is reducing the Laptop screen size. We appreciate your assistance with this problem. Can we have an option please to exit \"widescreen\" and go to \"Full screen\" mode in the Future? A small request hopefully, as we do pay for the streaming service. Thank you!",
      "This app is not the same as it was the first time I tried it.The first time there were not as many ads as there are now, and it played and casted better than it does now. The show I try to watch has problems casting, when it does work it disconnects then I start it again and instead of starting where it left off it starts at the beginning. By the time you get the program back to where you were it cuts off again. Very aggravating! Thinking about canceling this app just not worth the aggravation",
      "It lacks a lot of features that other streaming sites offer. It will not automatically go to the next series when you're binge-watching. It doesn't always tag the shows that you have watch so it's easy to lose place in a binge-watching. I wished it would let you skip the front trailer in the end where they show next week's programming.",
      "I just did your new update and its horrible. Cant even watch my soap. It keeps stopping for long periods! It was fine before, dont fix what isnt broken!!! Now its 3/19/2020 and its doing it again after doing your app update. All i get is a circle in the middle of the screen going around. No other apps have that problem!!! You need an update to fix the update!!! 3/20/2020, I still cant watch Y&R!!!! I get circle going around in middle of screen! It stops for a second, cant understand to 2 words.",
      "Glad we are wasting money on an app that does not work with mobile data. Disney + works fine. Netflix works fine. YouTube works fine. Videos on Facebook work fine Anytime I try to connect on mobile data I get told my connection is not stable enough, and that I should upgrade to commercial free. Get your stuff together CBS, why would I spend more money when you can't provide what you promised to begin with."

I get it's free but still, that many commercials, that often, is rediculous. The app claims you can pick up where you left off by signing up.... Not a fact.

      "it's great watching TV but as soon as you click on a movie it's all pixelated. It doesn't do it for TV shows only movies. You can also only watch things that are live or recorded on your DVR. I think I'll be going back to Hulu live TV. Also, I record The Magicians each week and each week I have to search for it to play an episode. I think Fubo is just starting out in the game and has a lot to learn but their charging as if their experts in it. Not cool.",
      "Ok it gets 3 because it gives me the networks I want. It looses 1 star because its difficult to navigate. If you look at a synopsis and go back it goes back to the top show instead of where you left off. Fast forwarding is a nightmare and I wish it would automatically play the next episode. Looses the other start for the price tag.",
      "This is the absolute worst streaming app we have ever used. We can't make it through any single episode without the video freezing at least a dozen times (sound continues, though) which forces us to close the app and restart everything. We canceled our subscription 2 weeks ago and cannot WAIT for it to be over. Save your money and go with literally ANY other streaming service.",
      "I really like fubo and with the last update I like what was done to upgrade the fast forwarding and rewinding. My only problem is since the last update ive noticed when I watch the new york rangers on msg and when watching cartoon network it is constantly going in and out of focus. It may be doing it on other channels also but its really bad on those. Please look into and fix this problem and I will change my rating and honestly if it is not fixed i will be canceling my subscription.",
      "This app was ok until the update...I was just dealing with the tech issues...but now if I want to watch a show it has been taking forever to load!!!! This is horrible! I reached out to customer service back in Nov. to trouble shoot.They told me I would hear back from them in 24 hours. It was a month later when I got an email...Not even a phone call! I started watching the app now and guess what? I'm still waiting on my show 2 load as I am typing this and it STILL ISNT UP YET! HORRIBLE SERVICE!"

      "Great app! To address what others are complaining about: I have vision issues and I can see everything just fine, there are the same amount of ads as every other streaming app. And this one is significantly less in price! IF YOU DONT WANT ADS DONT WATCH LIVE TV. Philo is excellent, highly recommend! So easy to record and you can record as much as you want for 30 days! If you dont watch it by then, you probably weren't going to watch it anyway!",
      "Great channel line up. Love the shows and really love the on demand. Unfortunately I get tired of it and turn to my old stand byes due to the number and lengths of commercial breaks. I actually stopwatch timed them today. Breaks were every 3.51 to 5.51 minutes apart. Talk about commercial overload especially when so many of us r stuck at home. Do u have a limited or no commercial break option? I pay CBS all access extra for no commercial breaks and love it.",
      "so-so as backup if other stream svc not working/available. pain in the butt that you cant cast directly from app. battery drains faster cause have to keep chromecast app open. even better would be an app i could install in smart hub of tv, then tv remote is functional & streaming isnt hogging all my phones resources. few positives are low cost, & being able to watch shows i missed earlier w/o using up all the dvr space. still, the other issues would never allow this to be my go to app.",
      "Great price for streaming your entertainment... Customizable channel guide is great , line up your favorite channels from top to bottom ( unless your married with children... In my house there is a me first list it goes like this---->>> kids, kids, wife, wife, kids, wife. Notice there is no \"Me\" on our list....thats because \"Me\" ends up on my tablet with headphones streaming Philo...unless it's a new Nick jr episode or Lifetime movie playing for family time. 😁👍",
      "Under \"Guide\" you need to have larger round icons for networks so they are large enough to see when scrolling. I'm 45 great vision and still have trouble. Look at the YouTube TV app it's the best design of the best. You should design yours more in line with their simplicity. You offer a great price but your Apple TV app is horrible. Can not see networks name when scrolling. You need a hide channel feature like YT. Only episode 10 & 11 showing of the walking dead? Why can't I view entire season?"

      "This is an update: this service has some horrible issues. They tried to make it look like it was my TV (was brand new). Then my internet but that was upgraded months prior due to other reasons. Nothing works. It constantly buffers (freezes) or just simply craps out (error message). Can't change the channel to a different show... makes it worse. You have to completely shut off your TV. The picture is awful... you see double vision and looks like moving in slow motion. It's a rip off",
      "The App won't let me sign in with correct log in information on the television. I messaged rep, was typing back and forth for an hour. The rep tells me he will \"troubleshoot\" and call back. That was over a week ago. I haven't been able to watch this for months, & get notification they're raising my rate (for the 3rd time in 3 months). Today when I attempted to open the app, all I saw was a blue spinning circle. You are unable to speak with anyone on a telephone. Cancelled. Will not use again!",
      "This is a poor excuse for a streaming app. 1) Episodes from different networks almost always pause and buffer at some point. (even with 140Mb+ download speeds) 2) Should you stop watching your current show, and decide to watch another show, (for your kids or spouse lets say) you will be unable to resume the first show from the last scene you watched. The app will force you to re-watch an entire episode even if your missing just the last 5 minutes.",
      "It has the most content. It needs improvement but they continue to do this. It's not the cheapest but u get what u pay for. The only big negative is they don't have live phone customer service and support. I hope this changes in the future. I have to type and chat with customer service back and forth with my two index fingers. It's very time consuming.",
      "Great content wise. Useability definitely horrible, doesn't allow casting, doesn't allow multi-screen, and if you leave the app and come right back restarts and sometimes you will end up watching 5 minutes of commercials, app freezes, 5 min. Commercials, then app freezes then again commercials. Happens tooooo many times. Honestly if it wasnt for the content it would be worse app I've used to stream. Horrible speeds, horrible useability and horrible set up."

Today it started to continuously buffer during ads & programming. All of the other streaming services I use are not having an issue. Nor am I experiencing any difficulty with any other online app or service. This app also lacks several features that I enjoy on other streaming apps. I would not recommend download",
      "Watching Biggest Losers and the episodes on the app are obvious edited down. Parts are cut out in the middle of conversations. Makes me wonder if other shows are edited down like this. It's super annoying. Picture quality is good. But give us the entire episode!",
      "I thought the episodes were unlocked for USA viewers a week after their release but I'm not finding it to be accessible. I'm trying to watch NBC, ABC, and CBS which I bought a ROKU to access then had to download the USA app, now I have to unlock this show, that show, every show to continue watching them. If I could afford $50 to $70 per month on cable, that would be much easier to access decent television. If you require I have a cable provider in addition to my ROKU stick why do I need a app?",
      "I don't know what just was fixed, but put it back the way it was! More bugs were added to this app, can't watch anything longer than 3 minutes without issues!!!!!",
      "Movies and my favorite shows with seemingly instant load times, and a few 30 second ads spread few and far-between puts this network app well above most other apps in the same genre. The effortless way to connect through your provider automatically and without the hassel of creating and maintaining a username and password has been the deciding factor for me personally. This app will live long and prosper. Well done! Whoever thought of that should have keys to the building! Lol"

      "Occasional hiccups in the ads and casting functions keep this from bring perfect. Playing the same ad five times in a row is irritating. Having the app crash while trying to cast is annoying. But it doesn't happen often. Other than that, the only other concern is the inability to watch an episode over again. The app plays all the ads associated with the episode, then goes back to the menu instead of playing the episode. Work it out guys!",
      "That app is awesome as a whole. Full episodes that my on demand doesn't carry let's me watch episodes I normally couldn't without having to pay for them. The reason I give this 3 stars is because they haven't added casting abilities while watching episodes. This means that you can only watch on your phone. (Why would you limit your potential?) Lastly are the ads. They are slow to load and often play back to back same ads. For this I felt the developers earned a 3 star rating.",
      "App UI is somewhat clunky (have to chromecast before hitting play, chromecast button is at top not floating so you have to scroll up) Also ad delivery is atrocious. 3 minute blocks of 10 second ads that keep repeating themselves. It just becomes obnoxious. I get you gotta get that dollar, but I don't want to watch at all anymore. Short ads? Short blocks. Simple.",
      "Extremely frustrating to watch anything on this app, which is really heartbreaking due to the fact that there are great shows listed on this network. Constantly getting interrupted with ( I guess its ads, but it's just a black screen) and also getting an \"something went wrong\" message after the show continues from break..please update this app to make it better. Will give higher star rating if improvement is awarded.",
      "I really enjoy being able to see all the shows I enjoy. The playback is very good. My only complaint is the commercials. I understand the need for them however I wish there wasn't so many during the program. The best part is the ability to unlock all the episodes. If not for that I would not have installed the app."

      "App is trash. Keeps force closing and crashing. Att and direct TV should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of product they have now. From the satellite TV to the app. Nothing works right. I have to unplug the swm power supply every other day or I get a 775 error. No one to come out and look at it either. This is before Corona shut everything down, I'm just now getting around to posting about it. If I had any other option for tv or internet I'd change in a heartbeat.",
      "Crashes all the time. If you have to pause and minimize to do something else, you need to log back in. DVR lets you fast forward commercials but on the app you have to watch the same 4 commercials over and over until you want to throw your device against a wall. When the app crashes every few minutes you have to watch from wherever the app feels like starting your show from and you cannot skip to where you were. There are like a BILLION sports channels! What the heck????",
      "It use to be a good app, but now the app is out of sync with the voice. Also, just like everyone else, I can be in the middle of watching a show and it freezes!!! I force stop the app, clear cache, clear data, and restart my phone. It only fixes the issue for about 20mins, then I have to do the process all over again. I've had to download other tv apps to watch my favorite shows because of this problem. New update to fix this, please!!! Ugh!!!",
      "Slow slow slow. Slow startup. Slow navigation. Slow response. Slow authentication. \"Cannot play content at this time\". \"Network error\" \"Unable to authenticate \" and other errors happen randomly then go away on a subsequent try, or after forcing the app to close and restarting it. My home network is rock solid and no other app has issues. Clearly the QA process is severely lacking. This app is a major disappointment.",
      "I cannot log into my account! It keeps telling me my email and password are incorrect, but it is correct. I went to create account and it tells me I already have one. Well, duh, I don't understand why I can't sign in. This is way more complicated then is necessary, the app won't even send me a link to my email to correct the problem. Smh I hate this app!!"

      "Will agree with people saying this app use to be great. I loved watching movies from Google play. But recently I rented The Joker but it was wasted money instead because I kept getting a message that said it can not playback and something about needing chromecast. It's a bummer because I was really looking forward to watching that movie. Now I cant watch any one the movies I've purchased in the past. I'm so sad 😭😭😭",
      "I love using this app for most of my digital media purchases. One problem, though and I'm not sure if it's being looked into or how deep it goes. I think whoever is in charge of creating thumbnails is completely unprofessional. My example is The Magicians in the newer seasons, whoever created the thumbnails is intentionally picking characters making a \"goofy\" face. Season four is a very emotional and powerful season, but the thumbnails created for it make it out to be a complete joke!",
      "Used to be ok but now useless. I keep getting an error when trying to play anything in my library. The error says 'this type of playback isn't supported and I need to use Chromecast instead of mirroring' But I'm not trying to mirror my screen, just watch on my phone. Tried reinstalling the app but no difference. Used to work fine til yesterday so now my movie collection which I have paid alot of money to Google for is not accessible! Needs to be fixed urgently.",
      "1st, it's absolutely ridiculous that with an Android TV Box you CAN NOT download a content unless you use WiFi! I have a much faster Ethernet connection but it says I have to use WiFi! That is completely stupid! Second, you download the videos and good luck finding them. Of course even though I bought them there is no standard video file in the locations it says movie / tv files or stored, whether I tell it internal or SD Card. I'm disappointed I didn't know these things before I bought content. Just having to switch my box back forth from Gigabit Ethernet to WiFi is bad enough then to not be able to move them to my 2TB hard drive simply adds insult to injury!",
      "Its a really great app. But when ever I'm trying to play some of the TV series. I purchased some episodes won't play. It keeps on saying error and try to restart my device if problem persists. I tried that. And it isn't working. And I still can't watch my purchased movies. When they are downloaded. Only on wifi. Please fix this"

I would like it better if it did not tell me I am not connect to the FIOS server and I am in the house not even 3 feet from the box. This means I can't watch a show on my phone from the guide while my grandson watches a show on the TV and the signal droping is nerve racking. This is not good and needs to be fixed. Especially since I have FIOS for TV, phone and Internet.",
      "I have this app on my phone and tablet, as well as enjoy it on my home tv. I attempted to add it on my laptop and the drop down menu listing all my devices then indicated there were no valid devices available. In light of this information should I understand that to mean there are no apps for pc/laptops?"

      "In between shows all it does is sits on a looped, silent, screen for 10+ minutes. Absolutely ridiculous! I would rather have ads playing, like the other apps do. It is constantly disconnecting from Chromecast. Lots of lagging. Out of an hour show I can watch about 3 minutes sporadically. This could be much better, but the effort isn't being put into it.",
      "Great app. Picture quality is good, has great sound and the download is fast. Can watch on all my devices, including my Ruko. Don't care much for the long pauses, would rather watch a commercial than nothing... But you dont have anything that describes what the movie or show is about , would be nice to know our than look at the title of what is being shown. Oh, could add some children networks please. Overall I Love It!! Keep up the good job.....",
      "Doesn't work with AndroidTV. Constant popups about API incompatibility, zero keyboard support. Trying to use a touchpad and drag things is an exercise in frustration. Would really like to watch some of the content I can manage to see, just can't see fighting this app to get to it though. Will keep it installed as a reminder to keep trying anytime an update is released.",
      "Horrible. Way too many commercials and its the exact same commercials everytime which gets annoying quick and with the constant STIRR we'll be right back screen for 5 mins is annoying. Both of these factors make it rather difficult to watch the local news which is the only reason i have this on my roku",
      "Doesn't ever work for TV streams. Months later no updates channels just spin. Pluto tv is killing it and this app doesnt seem to care at all."

      "There is a RIDICULOUS amount of ads in each episode you watch. Not worth your time. When you have to watch 5-9 commercials per interruption and you're interrupted 3-5 times each episode...it's ridiculous. And if you try and skip forward or backward during regular play, you get to do it all again. Can't skip ads either and they automatically sell your info unless you go into the settings and check a box not to",
      "The ads were annoying enough, but now (watching on Chromecast) my phone gets a notification, buzzes, and blocks my screen at the start and end of ads. This interfere with anything I'm doing and adds no value. Moreover it regularly says no connection when there is one, and it can even connect to the Chromecast on my wifi. I'll be deleting the app, and watching with adblocker on web.",
      "I screenshot the shows to my television. I just wish they would have the entire current season of a show, like Riverdale. I'm late to the party I guess. Lol. I haven't had any issues thus far. Also I wish the ads would only play at the beginning and end of the show instead of throughout. They do keep the ads short.",
      "Use to be the best casting app. Now its the worse. Biggest thing, it blows up ur phone with notifications while casting. Every new commercial, pause, play, fast forward, rewind, etc, it sends 1 to 3 loud notifications to ur phone with every action, easily close to 100 notifications per show. You have to silent ur phone. Very annoying. Then it doesnt remember where u left off. Then skips to the next episode. Have to watch 10min of commercials to find where u left off. Note 9. Chromecast Ultra 4k.",
      "This app allowed me to watch the episodes of supergirl, legends of tomorrow and batwoman to name a few that was perfect viewing; not like when I tried to watch them with my dvr where I had been experiencing since Sunday March 01, 2020 I think I was having this problem even in February and my wife even let me know that she has been experiencing these same problems on her TV Pixelation, picture and audio breakup (pausing and missing words) on the CW - WTTOD • 9 (Still happening even now.)"

      "When functioning properly it's a 5 Star app. But recently it has not been detecting nor connecting to my fire stick at all. I've even unplugged fire stick a few times for at least 30 seconds and more 😔. Last time something like this happened i just bought a new one and everything was fine again. Could it be time for a new fire stick? Is that the ultimate fix... new fire stick after new fire stick.",
      "Used to work great. Stopped working a few months ago out of nowhere. It wont connect to my device. I deleted the app and redownload it. I tried to put it on my bf's apple phone (I have an android), but it didnt work on his phone either. I keep trying to use it every few weeks to see if they fixed the problem, but nope.",
      "After losing my firestick, I had to use this as a last resort to watch TV. And boy, is this truly a last resort. Half of the time, it struggles to connect to the tv (that's only a few feet away, may I add), and the inputs lag a lot, too. Everytime my phone turned off due to inactivity, theres a 50% chance it wont connect again. But, as I had no other choice, I kept using it. But, the last straw was when it just stopped connecting entirely. Save your sanity and just buy a new remote.",
      "Works great when it does work. I've used it tirelessly as a backup for my lost or broken remote. I've written the developers but have no response. Have any of you? I feel the lost connection issues could be an easy fix. I could probably fix the code myself. It's not my job. As bad as it runs now, sadly it's still the best one on Google play. I would buy this app if they would fix it. But they want you to buy the firestick remote replacement is the obvious reason they won't fix it.",
      "The app works maybe 5% of the time, if that. Otherwise it says it cannot pair with the stick. i've tried uninstalling/reinstalling/signing out/signing in/ unplugging a replugging stick etc. I feel that the only reason this simple bug hasn't been fixed by a huge tech-savvy company is because Amazon is purposely providing a faulty app so that you are forced to repurchase the tiny, black, easily misplace-able remote 😞"

      "App is complete trash. Never stays signed in. Plays tons of ads even though you pay. Always says playback error check connection. I have 200mbps internet. The connection isn't the problem. Can't watch anything on mobile data, just buffers . Also the UI for the app is terrible. I need Google maps just to navigate it. AMC makes good TV shows. They don't know how to make an app. Tubi and Crackle are better and more stable as far as the apps concerned and they are free .",
      "Constantly logs out and the UI is insufferable. I tried using this app but it's absolutely horrid. The interface doesn't allow you to save any show you're watching or has an easy to use library. After I find the show I want to watch it logs me out if the app I've paid for after every episode. The app on the Xbox suffers from the same UI but so far hasn't logged me out.",
      "Crashes constantly. always has issues casting. Seems the only thing that keeps a solid connection is the commercials that will loop over and over and over again while the shows disconnect and freeze. Sometimes the show doesn't load at all and commercials will continue to play... I hope they can fix this app because it's a joke",
      "This app is horrific. Most of the time the app is useless, with infinite loading screens, repeating ads to the point where you want to rip your hair out, and of course, not being able to log in to view anything. Don't even waste your time with this garbage, it works when it wants to, which is very rarely.",
      "This has to be one of the worst TV apps. I skip a few minutes to get back where I was when the app randomly decides to bring be back to the 2 min mark. Then I have to watch like 3 sets of 2 min ads and hope it decides to work. Also the UI sucks."

And they haven't released the full episode yet. So then what's the point of having the episodes even pop up. It's annoying because I sometimes miss an episode when it airs on TV and I can't even use the app to catch up because they dont have updated episodes, even after they air on tv.",

I have to sign in everytime and that process takes forever...if it works at all. A lot of times i get looped back to the sign in screen again. Smh",

Finally it'll start working and everything's cool, then it'll just randomly not play videos",
      "This app is garbage on your phone. Every time I get a call while watching it takes 20 min for the show to resume. You guys should get with Hulu on how to have shows resume after a phone call without having to restart the entire app a few times. I'll just watch my shows on spectrum app.",
      "Such a terrible \"log in\" process (on Andriod, at least). I have to uninstall/reinstall the app everytime I watch something because it never loads once I choose my provider if I don't. I will even have the option on a program to \"resume play,\" but it makes me choose provider even after knowing I was there and gets stuck on the hourglass after that."

      "This is now my favorite app again! Thanks for fixing my problem i wrote about below!: This used to be my favorite app! But one day it stopped working on my android phone. I unistalled and re-installed the app several times to no avail. It keeps saying check your Internet connection even though I'm using my phone data. Even if I switch to Wi-Fi it still does not work. All my other apps work perfectly. My Internet connection is high and works great. I relied on this app every week. Very upsetting.",
      "Newest Update fixed it! Thanks! Been using the app on galaxy s5 since cut the cable cord 3 years ago. We loved it as it is the best we found to get OTA listings. Started getting glitchy this week. Error about issues with internet connection even though the in app ads came through just fine. Installed the upgrade; issue not resolved. Sure hope it gets resolved. updating cell phone is not an option. If not to be resolved, would be extremely helpful for dvlprs to post compatibility information.",
      "For no reason at all this app keeps telling me to check my internet connection and it won't work. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. Still will not work. Don't know what happened to it. I've had this app for a very long time now don't know why all of a sudden it is not getting a connection to the internet. I am connected to the internet. Every other app Wi-Fi stuff works. Update: issue with the app has been fixed,reinstalled it so far so good thank you TV Guide I did not like that other cheesy",
      "Totally unusable now. Same error message everyone else is getting, there's nothing wrong with my internet connection. Very disappointed nobody's fixing this after all the complaints. Even after the new update it's still dead. Zero stars if I could. ☹️ Too bad, I used it for several years, off now to find something that works. Update...app has been fixed, glad to have it back!! Thanks, 5 stars again!",
      "Stopped working earlier this week. Says no internet connection - try again, but every other app that needs internet is working fine. Still not working 3/11/20. OK, it's working again and is once again the best TV guide app. But next time let's not take over a month to fix a problem that completely shuts down the app!"

      "Worst App Ever. (Sony Smart TV) Every time we paused a show, we had to back all the way out, come back in, resume. Then, it stopped working altogether. Had to uninstall app, reinstall it, then do the \"run to the computer, log in, enter the six digit code\" dance. I'll also say that the selection, many which are duplicated on Hulu, Netflix, and Disney+, isn't worth the price. Didn't even finish the free trial. We're done with it.",
      "Terrible Terrible Terrible I mean for $5.99 there's a lot more value out there I will be cancelling I've truly given this app an honest shot as I do like some of your entertainment offerings but can't deal with the constant buffering freezing casting issues from my Brand new Samsung Galaxy S 10 C'mon guys get it together heard it was better but couldn't try trial again and so I paid will not pay again till I know for sure. Thanks Rip off Rip off Rip off Rip off Rip off",
      "Absolutely horrible selection of tv shows and movies, it's asinine that they want money for such a horrible app. There's several free apps that have a much better selection of tv and movies.",
      "I've never used this app I have been trying to cancel my subscription since the first month you charged me bout a year please tell me how to uninstall before bill is due again...very unhappy with this... and guess it's okay if you like old movies...but I do not thank you...",
      "I don't understand. Why can I not watch Epix on my computer? I was really excited to start Deep State, but I can only run Epix on my phone. I'm very disappointed. I don't want to pay money to have to watch what I want on a 3 inch screen."

      "Streaming to tv has improved a lot, but you still cannot decide what level of HD you want to stream based on the bandwidth you have. You can do it for downloads, sort of (low/med/high), but this doesn't really tell you anything except for how many hours you can store. This is useless for phone users who may want to tailor the quality to their phone's resolution. Also, I think the older Simpsons episodes are still oddly cropped to fit 16:9, which cuts off some of the image.",
      "Lots of content, but the app is trash. The app is not at all feature-rich, and it is often glitchy. Most shows are 2min long, and it stops playback after every show. This drives my kids nuts, which in turn drives me nuts. I dont want to have to find and play a new episode every 2 min or less. Netflix has set the bar on what to expect from a streaming app, and disney cannot compete. Casting to another device, is never a smooth experience.",
      "Update March 22: after downloading an update for the app, now I can't watch anything. The audio come through but the screen just stay black. For all the shows and movies. Please fix. If you haven't update, don't do it!! __________________ Does not work in note 10 I have a note 10 plus and I get the error 83. Still waiting for the fix. Thanks.",
      "Got the app when it originally came out a few months back to watch the mandalorian... But the moment the season stopped I tapped out because the app does not work. It freezes. Audio de-syncs. Not worth the money when other streaming services can provide subtitles, and fluid streaming. And if you look up the problem it just falls back onto your internet speeds... which I do not have a problem with. I regularly sit at 24mbps. Disappointed and will be uninstalling again.",
      "Very, very frustrating. Since update about 2 weeks back, app allows log in and access to title select screen, then simply doesn't work. Wouldnt even run previously downloaded content. After an endless series of 83 errors, I reinstalled. Now, I get to the play screen, and get a never ending load screen. PERMIT USE TO STREAM IN BROWSER, INSTEAD OF YOUR APP THAT DOES NOT WORK."

      "One of the best apps I watched for tv.. however it does need to do a better job at stopping n replaying Frm same spot... n going to the next following episode... at the moment too much of a hassle to get back at same spot n to change to next episode",
      "I would give this app a 000 if I could . I am uninstalling. Several shows in watchlist I cant watch yet because they do not have them and the ones I want to I cant figure out how without needing to also purchase the app that show is on. So it is not clear how to us it."

Purchase this easy way to turn your phone into a remote control for mobile apps on you're Smart TV. I have a Roku TV made by TCL. It's rated as the top smart tv.. For Cord cutters. I have a cheap antenna connected to my TV and I connected my TV wifi to the same wifi on my phone and get thousands of shows.",
      "Wow! I have been trying to set up a tv remote that works with my tv and roku streaming stick! I have been trying for over 2 weeks off and on with no luck. I downloaded this app and it practically did everything by itself! I did almost nothing! I definetly reccommend for anyone! Especially the technically handicapped. I'm happy!",
      "This app is pretty reliable when Roku's app isn't working properly. The only thing is unlike roku this app connects to cable and or antenna for your roku smart TV. In order to use TV setting like volume and cable or anttena channels one would need to be a premium user or pay for those extensions. What is free is fine and I have access to all the apps I have on my home screen in this app unlike with roku. Overall this is a very good app to replace Roku's when it isn't working properly.",
      "I was using the official roku app when it abruptly stopped working. I reopened it over and over, but it kept closing back up. I rebooted my phone a few times to no avail. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app it several times hoping that would work, it didn't... this app installed within seconds, found my roku device and worked flawlessly and immediately!",
      "I love it love it love it love it love it. It actually works. I lost my real remote for my TV and the remote on my phone made it super handy to have. Best part is it worked instantly. Like within the snap of my fingers. It was awesome and now I don't have to worry about the remote control because I have the remote on my phone. ( Product in the app store)"

      "Update fixed the fitting of the screen issue, but your streaming quality is horrible. It's blurry beyond being reasonable. ESPN is blurry for 10 seconds and it corrects itself. Also, does the status bar have to stay on showing me the time and how many bars I'm getting. Most apps it times out and scrolls up into the screen. Pretty frustrating imo....",
      "I was trying to watch the nba game. TNT app commercails are longer then TV commercails so I missed a little game every commercial break. Missed 1min of the halftime show. I like the half time show better then the game. And of course I missed the last minute of the game. 1st there was a timeout. 3mins go by. TNT comes back on. Game over. Lol. The worst.",
      "Update: 2-18-20: app simply won't load now. 0 stars. Original: This app crashes when you try to log in. It crashes when you select your programming. It will crash when an ad plays. Sometimes it crashes before it will even load. Pitiful. I wanted to update my review to note something else. So even if you check that you're logged in first, you can fully expect a significant chunk of your screen real estate will be occupied by a large \"sign in for full access\" bar along the bottom. Garbage.",
      "The bug is still there. When I stream to my chromecast from my phone. All I get is a TNT opening screen.",
      "Interruptions of any kind (like my alarm going off) force you to back out and restart anything you're watching."

Too Much Tom Styer or whatever his name is commercials, back to back. If you had regular commercials I would've rated 5 stars but I don't like being force fed Political Drama and Racial BS. Maybe they'll fix it. I have called and made several complaints about Haystacks commercials but other than that it's good"

An edit, I was emailing tech support back and forth and their last message to me said I needed to be using Android 5 or newer to which I replied that I'm using version 7 and they never responded back.",
      "Was a five star now a 2. This new update is so all over the place and dumb. My list it is buggy cause if you have or try to add a show on your wishlist it sections it off to allll your lists that are new and just gets you lost. It was one click. We don't need a list page for shows and movies. We have sections that say movies and TV and wishlist if was fine. If we are to lazy to look through our stuff thats our fault. Why can I look at a movie that I don't own and put it in a list? Wishlist? Y",
      "I haven't been able to use disc to digital for months. This was the entire reason I started using VUDU in the first place. Every other app can locate my phone, but not VUDU, so it isn't my phone. It keeps saying location must match Billing address. I am at my Billing address and I used to use this service with no problem. They need to fix this bug or remove the location requirement. This is ridiculous.",
      "I love this app! I've been using it for a very long time. I love that the free movies don't have too many ads and the disk to digital is something I've used a lot. Thank you for adding the list feature too. I like being able to group movies together. Y'all just keep making this app better every time! It'll be 5 stars when I can export it to my sd card.",
      "Have \"start from beginning.\" I have a lot of movies and I don't always see all movies in one seating. Having the option for watching a movie from the start would be great. Just about every other movie service offers this."

This app was free as a part of the unlimited package. Way took upsell. Call ATT and different agents tell different stories or don't know. Talk to ATT technical support, no help. Advised to go to ATT store, no help. They can help when it comes to accepting payments. This app SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!",
      "Maybe the most annoying app I've ever used. Have to reset password everytime I use the app; literally from one day to the next it'll log me out then not accept my password until I change it. Then the next time using it comes around and it won't accept the new password again until I change it. So ridiculous.",
      "The app has lots of commercials. No conservative or non biased news channels. Doesn't save marked shows for long. No options for selecting your own channel preferences. Has a few good channels, but most I would never watch.Streams great in low reception areas. Comes as part of the unlimited data plan and was intended to replace cable TV or dish. It is a poor substitute for either.",
      "I got this for free with my plan, but the stupid app won't even let me access it! It's constantly telling me to subscribe even though I am. I went to my local store to make sure I was doing things right, they confirmed that I was and needed to call customer service. Well three hours later and fifty redirections going through 600 different reps and Not One Single Person could fix or figure it out for me. Needless to say I do not recommend the app at all."

I have a cheap antenna connected to my TV and I connected my TV wifi to the same wifi on my phone and get thousands of shows.",

I downloaded this app and it practically did everything by itself! I did almost nothing! I definetly reccommend for anyone! Especially the technically handicapped. I'm happy!",
      "This app is pretty reliable when Roku's app isn't working properly. The only thing is unlike roku this app connects to cable and or antenna for your roku smart TV. In order to use TV setting like volume and cable or anttena channels one would need to be a premium user or pay for those extensions. What is free is fine and I have access to all the apps I have on my home screen in this app unlike with roku. Overall this is a very good app to replace Roku's when it isn't working properly.",
      "I was using the official roku app when it abruptly stopped working. I reopened it over and over, but it kept closing back up. I rebooted my phone a few times to no avail. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app it several times hoping that would work, it didn't... this app installed within seconds, found my roku device and worked flawlessly and immediately!",
      "I love it love it love it love it love it. It actually works. I lost my real remote for my TV and the remote on my phone made it super handy to have. Best part is it worked instantly. Like within the snap of my fingers. It was awesome and now I don't have to worry about the remote control because I have the remote on my phone. ( Product in the app store)"

      "I love this app. Because it has so many great movies and TV. a lot of the movies and TV shows that is on here I do watch on a day-to-day basis. Is better than having cable TV. Cuz it don't book a whole whole lot",
      "I love the app, it's has my favorite shows. But I wish it had all the episodes without you having to unlock them.",
      "The variety of shows and episodes is great. But my biggest issue using the APP is everytime it goes to commercial break I get the message \"Something Went Wrong\" and it goes back to episode selection screen. I also wish, after you logged in and made an account, there was a tab that shows you what shows you've been watching.",
      "Literally works about 25% of the time. Some shows are inaccessible because the app crashes completely if you click on it. At least once per show it will crash randomly for no reason, then it's 50/50 if you'll be able to get back to that episode. The most recent season of MAFS only displays 1 episode but there have obviously been more. And you CAN watch them - if you start at the beginning and scroll through to the end of each episode it will automatically go to the next one. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!!!"

No apparent link in navigation between the movie button and list of movies. I do not watch the series on this network so the app is useless to me.",
      "I would give it much higher, but the advertising freezes at the same area and I can't watch the rest of the show. The advertisement freezes at 10 seconds and it does not allow you to move pass that it and I can't match the rest of the show. How can I match the rest of the show? This happens on each one of the shows, not just one. So can someone help me with that problem please?",

      "This app is fantastic, it would've been 5 stars. But the app does not have all of the seasons, movies, episodes, and ovas(?) (i.e. the Unova, Kalos regions, and some DP episodes. I dunno want to know which ones are missing). But if and when it has everything, I will change my review. There's a minor glitch saying that changes have been made to my account, when I didn't do a thing with it. Then it fixes itself later on.",
      "My experience is simple. All that i needed was a good time seeing pokemon and that is full filled . I always searched it in youtube and i got a bad result but on this app i always got a good result. I am very excited in watching what will happen in the batlle between ash and kukui but the app hasnt uploaded it yet. I am waiting for it and also for the next season.",
      "I really love to watch the most recent episodes of Pokémon but, On my new phone I downloaded this and it's still at EP. 42 while on this phone it's already at 48, please fix this. I also tried to send it to myself, but I clicked on one note accidently and now I can't choose anything else anymore, my one note says \"working on it\" for a few hours now and it gets really irritating, please fix this too.",
      "I do not like this app for a few reasons, first being that not all episodes are there, second, most of the time the quality is really bad, third, the episodes I download are not permanently there in the *downloads*, and not even half of the entire show is not there. So better fix these problems as soon as possible. And forgot to mention another big problem, that is…while watching videos, in between the video stops playing, pause and unpause helps…but fix this too.",
      "Words can't describe how happy I am with this app. I've been dying to watch so many episodes of the original series, especially the one where Pikachu contemplates leaving Ash for a herd of wild Pikachu (Seas. 1, Ep 36 if you feel like bawling your eyes out). I'm also so ecstatic you have the first Pokemon movie on here. Netflix's updated rendition was honestly meh. PLEASE put more of the movies on here, ALONG with their pre-movie shorts. I would love you forever. Thank you. Fave Pokemon: Crobat"

      "Would not select a stat if it was an option. Haven't been able to log in for weeks. It keeps redirecting me to the login page, even after resetting the password, too many times to count. This app was free as a part of the unlimited package. Way took upsell. Call ATT and different agents tell different stories or don't know. Talk to ATT technical support, no help. Advised to go to ATT store, no help. They can help when it comes to accepting payments. This app SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!",
      "Maybe the most annoying app I've ever used. Have to reset password everytime I use the app; literally from one day to the next it'll log me out then not accept my password until I change it. Then the next time using it comes around and it won't accept the new password again until I change it. So ridiculous.",
      "The app has lots of commercials. No conservative or non biased news channels. Doesn't save marked shows for long. No options for selecting your own channel preferences. Has a few good channels, but most I would never watch.Streams great in low reception areas. Comes as part of the unlimited data plan and was intended to replace cable TV or dish. It is a poor substitute for either.",
      "I got this for free with my plan, but the stupid app won't even let me access it! It's constantly telling me to subscribe even though I am. I went to my local store to make sure I was doing things right, they confirmed that I was and needed to call customer service. Well three hours later and fifty redirections going through 600 different reps and Not One Single Person could fix or figure it out for me. Needless to say I do not recommend the app at all."

      "I finally found an easy way to watch my old DVDs using this app. After downloading the movies to the directory file it is simple to pick the TV device you want to play the movie on. I use Amazon Fire stick 4.0. The picture and sound are very clear. Excellent app! I highly recommend it. Update: I've been using this app for a couple of weeks now and I love it. With the COVID precautions right now, I am able to stream my JW meetings on the TV. Excellent!",
      "Seems good and solid, i would give it a 5 stars, but there's only one problem: the movie crashes randomly, usually 2 or 3 times during one movie. Then you must restart the app and manually search the movie to continue watching from where it was interrupted. It can be quite annoying when having a movie night with friends. Fix this and i'll give a 5.",
      "Was using allcast prior to this app. Alllcast can't access the sd card. Its ads are a bit more obtrusive. No volume control. Used with xbox. Randomly down ALL DAY. Switched to Xcast. Instantly found the xbox to mirror to. Can open SD. The ads are so tiny. Can control volume, replay, shuffle and more. Even has sub file support. You can click where you want to jump to on the video. Queue is annoying, it queues the whole folder you open. Honestly doesn't get in the way though. 5/5 love it ❤❤",
      "So I have a bug report hoping this gets attention. When I pause something I'm streaming to my firestick, if it goes into screensaver I can no longer pickup where I left off. I can't even stream anything. I have to restart my firestick and app sometimes even my phone to get connection. Glitch on samsung a20 but experienced on zte as well. Love the app otherwise connects fast",
      "Works 70% of the time for me. Occasionally it won't work well with my Bravia's inbuilt Chromecast. Don't know whether it's the app or the TV. Ads are a bit intrusive with full screen banners playing sketchy videos with sound. It being not cent percent working for me is keeping me away from buying the ad free version."

Loved it, would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat, it was cheaper because they didn't have to make as many DVDs cut down the prices for the movie companies...then Fandango bought it...you can't earn discounts with purchases, and now it is just as expensive to buy a movie on this app as it is to go out and buy the DVD. From $19.99 to $27.99?! It's now cheaper at the stores to buy the actual disc!",

      "I haven't seen a lot of these shows, so the content is decent for me. Since there isn't a ton of variety or new content on a regular basis, I'll probably cancel in 1-3 months time. The App itself is terrible. Constantly glitches, does not support Chromecast as it claims, can't use it simultaneously with other apps, and continuously rejects my username and password even though it's right. Overall, disappointed. It could have had a lot of potential",
      "Love the content but considering unsubscribing in search for a more reliable service. As others mentioned, the app just stops working (you get a grey screen or a loading screen) from time to time. This happened on Feb 5th, when it did not work for a day, and today again. I don't use it every day, so it is possible it doesn't work more often than just a few days a month. No response or apologies/refunds from developers. Please fix this.",
      "Having the same problems I have been reading about on here. Won't replay a show if I want to watch again. Now it won't play an episode I haven't watched. Please fix. I have reinstalled and signed out and back in. Thanks. Was working for awhile but as of 11/20 or so it started not letting me rewatch a show or continue on to the next episode of a series I'm watching. Please fix Thanks ps I'm using my Mobile phone. Hello. The app has been great. But has 3/17 it won't load just broken circle.",
      "I like the shows, but... I can't log in to watch them anymore. It says my password is invalid. I changed my password, twice, to try and fix it. Still can't log in. Tried to delete the app and download again. Still can't log in. Tried to turn off my tablet and turn it back on again. Any guesses? Yep, still can't log in.",
      "The app is ok but the service is not. There is no way to rate them separately so I'm going to review the service since it costs money. The service is relatively cheap, currently $7/mo less 2 months if you pay for a year at a time. They do have a lot of the old BBC shows but they fall short on several of the newer shows. For example, I really like the \"new\" doctor who that started running in 2005 to now. They have NONE of those seasons available. For me this is a deal breaker."

      "Still unable to access anything because it won't let me sign in. I know there's a pandemic going on. I understand that you might not be there but it's just kind of annoying that the sign on issue is still going on. Old review. I keep trying to log into Xfinity and it keeps popping up with an error webpage not available. I can still watch some of the show but everything is locked.",
      "No rewind or forward control 😬 I don't understand why there aren't rewind or forward controls (like 10 seconds back and forward). There are many times when I'd rather not even use the app because I know there's likely to be a point when I want to rewind, and will have to sit through like 10 minutes of already watched content because it's darn near impossible to go back a specific amount of time when forced to use your fingertip on the time bar.",
      "I love the content and love being able to cast to my TV. However, I am forever arguing with the app to get it to consistently access the content I want. It'll go along flawlessly for a while, then abruptly stop and say that I'm not authorized to access the content I was just watching, even though I'm still logged in through my Xfinity account. An hour or reinstall later, it works just fine. Same issues pop up on Food Network Go. Love the idea, just wish it didn't require so much fiddling.",
      "This app is super clunky and full of bugs. Constantly doesn't save where I left off on shows which has probably wasted hours of my time just skipping through episodes, which you can't even do without the app glitching out, not playing videos, crashing, etc. Weird keyboard glitches when you type stuff into the search bar. Not able to go to show's main page from anywhere but the search bar. Continue watching section goes blank randomly. The list goes on it's just ridiculous.",
      "Again, another useless streaming app. This thing crashes at least 3 tome per hour long episode and don't forget the insane number of adds, over 30 for one show, then the app hangs at the end of the ads and when you restart you have to try to get theough the ads again...good luck! Total piece of garbage."

      "So many ads. Just so many and so long in between. I have no problem with ads, but there are so many and at 3 minutes a pop its excessive. People arent complaining about the ads, but if you're going to do 3 minutes worth if ads at a time, is all that necessary. I'm going to delete this and just watch clips on youtube. It's not worth it for all the ads",
      "What the hell!! I've been using this app for months to catch up on whatever shows I miss. Our cable is set up through our business because it's at the office and we dont have cable at home. I've never had an issue logging in or watching the shows until today. All of a sudden after all this time when I go to log in, an error message pops up saying this app does not support business accounts. That is BS! was never an issue before. Guess I will be deleting this since I can't use it anyway.",
      "Terrible the worst app. Adds are ridiculously long. You can't rewind without it jumping all over and making you watch another over 2 minutes of commercials. I would be near end of episode and it would start over. Installed it today because Spectrum does not have the 90 Days Before episodes on demand. I needed to catch up on 2 it literally took hours and was seriously annoying. I will be uninstalling now. I will quit watching the show before ever trying to watch it on this app again.",
      "I had to change my 1 star rating. I thought the errors in the app were tlc fault, but I was signing in under the wrong name smh. Anyway I love the app on the firestick, I also love the auto play and the easy use. Started watching 90 day fiance and I cant stop. Now I have something to watch during this lockdown. Thanks TLC",
      "It works, finding shows is not easy. Not being able to have do a pic on pic. Or keep running on a small pic, would be better. The stop and buffer for 1-2 minutes is not fun. And going from wifi to data. Stopped the show completely. A sad cloud, as it tells you to retry. Going to beginning and having to start all over. Not cool. Other that. Not so bad. Can watch a lot of the shows I like."

      "I absolutely love this app. It has all the new movies and series and a lot of all old ones as well. But there's two problems that I don't like, a lot of the links they use don't work- please try and gix that in the new update- and the ads. The ads don't really bother me its that it's sametimes the same ad they play over and over. But i love this app.",
      "None of the streaming capabilities are functioning! I can get to the list if episodes of a show or to a movie but it just shows me a spinning circle forever. I've restarted my phone, reinstalled the app and nothing helps. You guys went from a 5 ☆ app to an app that lists movies and shows.....thats it! What happened? Please fix so I can come back....😟",
      "(Update March 20th) why are you advertising the miniseries \"V\" only to have something else a play instead? Message to the developer here, I clicked on the classic Flash from the 90s in the movie sections to watch one over an hour but roughly only get 48 minutes like a TV show and then I click the series, and I always get the modern CW Flash playing every time and I mean every single time of every episode of the classic flash I click on from the 90s, why, why why why and when will you fix it??",
      "Great app, except for having to go through the \"not a robot\" gauntlet! Please vet your ads. I just had a few ads with women half naked advertizing sex, or maybe erotic phone sex! I am a woman and I am NOT gay! So please remove those from my feed! I removed a star for that!",
      "It has everything that I have typed in including movies and tv series. But I am giving it 3 stars because I can load the tv shows with no problem and they work but I am having problems loading the movies and there is alot of ads. So fix those 2 problems and I will give it 5 stars."

      "Good shows, glitchy app. \"Sorry, we are unable to load this stream.\" I get that a lot. I love these shows when the app actually works. It's not my wifi or phone. Because everything else on my phone works. And sometimes it just randomly loses connection. Disappointing. Acorn TV does work on my desktop TV, however. Is there. Setting I'm overlooking?",
      "Buffers every 30s secs the last couple of days...so frustrating!!!! I am still on my 7 day trial so can't say if this is normal or not. It never happens with any of my other streaming apps so I know it is not my device. Also it rarely seems to be able to start a show from where it left and doesn't always recognise an episode has been watched.",
      "The Acorn programming is great but the app is very poor. Here are a couple of the problems I have with the app: When casting to my TV I have to start the program on the app then cast it, otherwise the cast attempt fails. The \"recently watched\" section of the app lists the same two shows for months even though I have watched several dozen shows by now. The app doesn't keep track of the episodes that you've watched in a series, so you have to figure out which episode is next every time you watch.",
      "Theifs!!! They will give you a free trial for week, like most things you give them your card information so they can charge you after the free trial. However contrary to following their instructions there's no way to cancel. I tried to cancel on my phone cancel on my computer add to cancel through your fire TV those instructions and it gives you no ability to what does is let you sign out at the top of it. Also they claim that their customer service can't cancel your account for you. Fraud fraud",
      "Not impressed at all. Is there a point to even telling you. I've tried contacting you and apparently not email to you will not send. I cant get anything from the app \"sorry cant stream or load\" is the standard message I get. If I cant access so.ething I'm paying you for then what is the point. This nonsense has happened before. I get no help, no way of contacting you. Not even sure u will get this either. So basically I'm paying \"acorn\" for absolutely nothing."

      "I like this app its easy fun and fast. My kids can use this app they enjoy watching their cartoons and kids movies. Hard to find kid movies that are any good these days. My wife can watch her tv series any movies she likes. You can almost guarantee to watch and pick what you want. This is one the top apps I enjoy the most. I've gave it to my friends, cousins, co worker, people at church, and my brother and sister. They have passed it on to the 4kids and friends. I hope this app doesn't close or",

    "description":"With the app \"TV (Samsung) Remote Control\" you can use your smartphone to control your Samsung TV over the local network and/or with IR (if your android has infrared port). \r\n\r\nYou have 2 options:\r\n\r\n★ Network IP control (WiFi / WiFi Direct / LAN).\r\nWorks with C, D, E, F, K and M (2016+) models, but not with H and F models.\r\n - Make sure the TV that you want to use is turned [On]\r\n - Make sure your mobile device and TV are connected to the same home network. If your router supports a privacy separator function, make sure it is disabled.\r\n - It is also possible to enter the TV's IP address manually. To find you TV's IP address go to TV: [Menu] → [Settings] → [Network] → [Network Status].\r\n\r\nIf TV was found but after selecting the TV:\r\n - If you have refused the confirmation message on your TV (\"accept device\") you need to change your selection by going to:\r\n [Menu] → [General Settings] → [External Device Manager] → [Device Connection Manager] → [Device List] or with older TV models [Menu] → [Network] → [Expert Settings] → [Mobile Device Manager]  or [Menu] → [Network] → [AllShare Settings].\r\n - You can disable the TV's (\"accept device\") screen by going to eg. [Menu] → [Settings General] → [External Device Manager] → [Device Connection Manager]  and changing [Access Notification] -> \"First Time Only\".\r\n - If a PIN code is requested on your TV screen - sorry, but with this TV this app won't work :(\r\n\r\n★ Infrared (IR) control\r\n- This option works on phones and tablets with built-in IR blaster such as Samsung Galaxy S, HTC ONE, LG G3/G4/G5,  Xiaomi Mi / Redmi / Note, Huawei Mate / Honor etc).\r\n- Tested with Samsung TV F and M models, but probably works also with others Samsung Smart TV-s build 2005 and later (if it does, then let us now and give feedback).\r\n- Please note that you must point your phone’s IR blaster directly at the TV. Usual working range is 4-10ft (1-3 meters, max ~5 meters).\r\n- With some phones in power saving mode or with almost empty battery the IR blaster might not work or range is less then 5ft (2 meters).\r\n\r\nThe purpose is not to replace the original TV remote, but this app is handy in emergency situations (original remote is lost, empty batteries etc). It's ready to use (no need for pairing with the TV).\r\n\r\nIf this app doesn't work with your phone or TV then feel free to e-mail me (your exact TV and phone model).

      "Have had it for a year or just under worked good, you can't turn the TV on with it though. And when the tv is turned off then back on it always has to be synced up again. But now it's not working at all. I hate it on 2 of my phones and neither are working so not sure what going on it tries to automatically connect but fails. So I try sync it up and every time my TV shows up when I click on it it disappears and the app freezes.",
      "I can't leave no stars, so I'll leave one. This app can't even find my tv. Tried all the suggestions in the help section, but it won't connect. The one time it did find the right tv, it said to accept the connection on the screen. Well, if I can't find my remote to the TV (the entire purpose of downloading this app) then how can I do that? Still looking for an app that ACTUALLY works. This was my third try 🙄",
      "Want a TV remote that shows you ads every time you want to change the channel? Yes? Then get this app. Lost on the developer, the TV remote is supposed to be a way of quickly being able to change the channel or volume, however with this app you are forced to watch videos before you can do that all in the name of £¥€$. Infuriating and unnecessary if the world wasn't full of people obsessed with money. Would be a fantastic app without the ads, sadly though that isn't an option..",
      "Worst remote app I've ever tried to use. I say tried, because I've gotten it to work maybe twice since we got our new TV. We keep the remote hidden due to having a toddler, but she largely ignores our phones. Every time I turn the TV off/on, it apparently changes its IP address, because why not! So I have to go to the app settings and try to find/pair with it, 99% of the time it just spins and spins never finding the TV. Poor design and implementation. I expect better from Samsung.",
      "This remote app is the best one I've ever used. I can turn the TV on and off with the remote, and the response time is spot on. It's nice being able to have a list of apps on the remote so I don't have to go digging through my phone to find them each individually. However, the ads are frequent and annoying. There is no ad free purchase option, and because of this I've given it 3 stars. Once this option becomes available I will change my rating and review."

      "Wish I could give 0 stars. Seriously fix your app. It's so buggy!! No episodes load. It's always telling me to check MY internet connection. Which is fine btw. Your app is just too slow. And honestly compared to all of the other AMAZING QUALITY streaming apps, this one is just not worth the headache. Sorry, i would have loved to watch some of the great reality tv you do offer, but not going to keep trying when the problem is on your end.",
      "This app is terrible, after trying it out the last few days, I remember why I deleted it in the first place. Constantly buffering. Have tried it on mobile, and multiple TV's. Constantly asking for tv provider after already logged in. What a hassle. Update: this app is still awful. You watch a buffering screen most, followed by ads, followed by some content but back to buffering",
      "Ads between your Ads... I FINALLY got the app to accept my carrier info and can watch full episodes, but the Ads are RIDICULOUS. The way it went was: 3 Ads, intro to the show (Ink Master), 4 ads, first segment of the show that was only a couple minutes long, then another ad starts, and I see \"1 of 19\"... THAT'S NINETEEN ADS IN ONE COMMERCIAL BREAK! So I hadn't even gotten half way through the episode and I was expected to watch over 15 minutes of ads for what wasn't even 7 minutes of content!",
      "I gave this app a 2nd,3rd,&4th opportunity to work, I was able to watch a few episodes of Bar Rescue, after numerous attempts, after watching a single episode the app flopped and failed, please remedy these issues, I will persist on attempting to use the app, I also will post Reviews updating what works and what doesn't work, Update,,, user tip, repeatedly click the retry error and video will play",
      "Sorry this video is not available of 68 whiskey season one episode one. On the Paramount Apple TV app signed in using DirecTV log in. I use the Apple TV in my second home using my DirecTV log on. Your app designers engineers are by far the worst. Why can't the app just work with out interruption, without errornmessages simply just work. Apple TV 4k version."

      "Well it looks like I will be canceling my subscription that I just got an hour ago I was really looking forward to this app but the reviews about it playing only for 3 minutes and then constantly restarting are true what a shame I'm just glad I didn't get the yearly subscription. Very disappointed",
      "Really could do with user comments, to help decide what to watch. The year of the content would also be useful - makes it easier to find reviews in IMDb App works ok and is fairly stable.",
      "So far I've had no issues on my Note 8. It works seemlessly with Chromecast and the streaming quality so far is good. The app itself, however, could use a little updating. Navagation is awkward and there are no viewer reviews or discussion feature as in other apps in this category. As far as the content, the verdict is still out so my review may be updated in the near future.",
      "Just reading the description section of this app makes me hesitant to subscribe. This is the Android / Google store and it says in the app description here to \"Enjoy it all on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.\" That makes me pause and wonder what kind of support us Android users get as does the last update notes listing what's new, saying support for Android O is new. That was in August. It's now November and, um, we're on Android P. If you can't develop an app correctly and update it correctly for Android, just delete it from the Play Store instead of offering a junk of an app.",
      "The content is limited but I really enjoyed some of them. All videos are close captioned. But the app just sucks. Takes forever to open and when I go to home screen during playback and go back the app reloads and takes another forever. It looks like an iOS app from 2012 & it's more unstable."

      "We are RVing and moving around locations this app allows me to customize the TV channel line to match the channel line from the RV Park. A channel in the RV Park could on Channel 4 but comes off satellite as channel 523. Channels not received can be eliminated. It too a bit to figure it out but it is a great app. And unlike TV Guide app this app shows and EPG (electronic program guide) for the channel when selected.",
      "This has been such a welcome experience! I had the TV Guide App for a long time and it was truly not working and had so many problems. Frustrating to say, the least! I would please just suggest that you might show the release date for all movies and not just the ones you are able to scroll down to see the \"Show Overview\" which does show the release date, duration, movie type. I am new to the App. I don't believe that most Listings show the date and year. Now that would also be great! Thank you!",
      "I use this app every day and it is almost always reliable. My only big frustration is that you can't customize the channel list. We live between two major markets and get some, but not all stations from both. The app forces you to choose only one broadcast city at a time. Also, you can't hide listings for channels that you do not get. Another improvement would be an update for digital subchannels. Many of our stations now have as may as 7 digital channels, but the app only shows the first few.",
      "Easy to use. Accurate. Description about each program and dates of movies. Gives the actual channel numbers and times for major providers, spectrum, AT&T, Etc whoever the carrier is. Edit to list only channels u want. Easy to add or delete channels after initial settings.",
      "This app is pretty good as far as listings go for the day you were in . What if I want to see what's on tomorrow or the day after at a particular time I can't research it on this app. on the TV Guide app I can go as far as 2 weeks and research the TV show I would like to watch. The problem is is TV Guide isn't as good as this app is as far as listings go. With some of the networks they have shows off for Spring , winter or whatever and I just would like to find out when my show is coming On."

      "Not working for me either. Following the suggestions in other posts, I cleared the app's cache and did a storage cleanup on my phone. I also restarted my phone after uninstalling and reinstalling the app. So many people are having trouble and rather than try to fix the solution, the app creator just wants people to email them to troubleshoot. This issue has apparently been going on for several days; if your techs haven't been able to figure it out yet you might need new techs.",
      "So, i love that this app exists, i don't have cable so the fact that they have some things free is really nice. However, this is the 4th time that i have been in the middle of an episode of something that was free, had to close it out for an hour or so, then went back and the show or season was no longer free. There is an exhorbitant amount of commercials that have to be watched to have free stuff, to play with people this way...",
      "Uninstalled, reinstalled twice. The app opens to black screen with circle. I think it needs me to enter provider and password, etc. But there's no message, no dropdown menu, no buttons, nothing. UPDATE I contacted HGTV as requested. I've tried periodically using the app, with no success. I did get one error message, that mY have suggested the need to log on, which I did. I really miss using this app. 02/04/2020 Tried again today. Yayyyyyy! I'm in. Thanks! 😍",
      "I love the HGTV GO APP experience : to place a monitoring countdown of the commercial break's duration of the episode being sponsored knowing the approx. time; knowing how much time I have before the commercial break ends to prepare the popcorn or multi task before the episode starts, while listening to the commercials from the sponsor.",
      "Love! Love! Absolutely LOVE HGTV'S app! 🥰💞💜💙🧡❤💟💓💕💌 so easy to find all my shows plus, there's so many shows to choose from! So I'm gonna start at the top, and watch them all!"

It looks like two thieves merged together to loot the poor customers. Though it is a paid app you will get lots of adverts popups while watching. No any reputed channels. Once we paid the subscription they will never refund. You got no option than to watch what they provide . Please don't be a victim of this scam apps of LYCA TV and YUPP TV.",

If you are subscribing this channel for watching any of your favorite program and after work when you open the app/ weblink you can see that the program will be unavailable and when you ask support team as always they comment some of users are reported the issue and we escalated further on the issue. Worst of money ..waste of time...pathetic service and always shows the service is unavailable or blocked from source.",

      "I 🤩 almost everything about this app. The one thing that bugs me, is the \"continue watching\" slide show. If I'm watching a series, and have to stop, then click the \"continue watching\" it let's me finish my show, but instead of going on to the next episode of the series, it picks up from the last thing I watched on a different series. I also dont like if I start a series over again, it doesn't start the next episode from the beginning. It just runs the credits, for each episode, where it ended",
      "love the channel but not the app. everything is locked if you can't afford to have a cable or satellite account. sad for us poor people :( That was the point,that some people can't afford to have an account other channels that have an online apps. Usually let you watch one or two episodes per series. ID is locked so airtight that you can't even watch one or two episodes from season 1. But with your intelligent rep. You really should read the review before you reply. I'm poor can't afford cable",
      "Can't take all the ads. Hate em! ID, though I love the shows, it's not worth the aggravation of having to dodge (mute, shut my eyes, go fill my coffee mug, throw in a load of laundry), all those annoying stupid commercials & advertisements! THERE ARE SO MANY ADS - SEEMS EVERY FIVE MINUTES -- AND THEY'RE SO FREAKN LONG! And I'm paying for this app. Until I figure out how to cancel.",
      "5 stars for content, 0 stars for commercials. If I accidentally lose my place in a video it's hell to pay trying to get back as in 3 minute increments you can easily spend 30 minutes trying to find your place. It's just a matter of time until I uninstall this app. There are other apps available with far less advertising. MY RESPONSE TO ID GO: I didn't complain about advertising. I complained about EXCESSIVE ADVERTISING. UPDATE: I'm uninstalling now. Let me know if you decrease your advertising.",
      "I edited my rating and bumped it up to 2 stars ONLY because the customer service is awesome. I am still irritated with the app. I pay for the channel on my regular cable. I have AT&T NOW but because I don't pay for the channel through THAT I can't unlock shows. Makes no sense. I pay over $200 (to AT&T) for cable and nothing for the AT&T NOW (free with cell service) and I still don't have access. My ID account used to work just fine. Frustrating!"

      "I love the Travel Channel, but for this app if you want to watch anything new, you must be paying a provider to see it. Some of us got sick and tired of paying someone else to watch channels that are then cancelled, or the provider does a price hike. I personally just got tired of paying more for less and unplugged from them all. I can't afford less for more, as I'm now disabled, with other health issues I have to pay for, so I resorted back to an antenna that's free.",
      "I love this app I can take some of my favorite shows like ghost adventures anywhere but what I'd really like is to have the ability to watch ads for locked content like a certain amount like 10 ads to watch this episode on top of the ones already shown during the show anyway I think this would boost your profits and amount of people who download the app and if you could rotate the free seasons every month that would be really cool",
      "I have not been able to use the app for about 2 weeks now. I thought it was due to the update that my phone, Samsung Galaxy S10, did an update but every other tv app(netflix, hulu, disney+, etc...) work just fine along with everything else. Judging by all of the reviews I'm seeing here, it looks like the problem is the app itself. I have cleared all of the system cache, the app cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app twice and it still does not work. I have also already submitted a help request as well. Since other people are having the very same issue with the app, why not just say 'we are looking into the problem' or 'we are aware there may be a problem and are trying to pin point the issue'",
      "App is flat out not loading after the Galaxy s10+ update. And no, clearing the cache does not fix it. Things that also do not fix it: uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting the phone, etc. This is disappointing considering Travel Channel is awesome, but I guess I'll just have to go outside and experience life beyond my phone. Please don't make me do that. I'd rather watch it through this app. Just fix it. Thank you.",
      "This app does what it's supposed to do, it plays travel channel shows. The problem is though, the shows are not in the order that they came out, they're all jumbled up, and it doesn't keep track of the shows that you watched. Also there are so many dang commercials. I cannot believe the amount of commercials that are on here. I specifically got this app just so I can watch ghost adventures and the lineup is completely screwed it up and the commercials are unbelievable."

I read the FAQ's; no help.I'll just go get a new remote.This app might work for others but judging from the reviews I read..I'm thinking they are also not too impressed. Tighten up Xfinity.

      "Descriptive without sounding like the directors or producers wrote the descriptive bio to promote their own work. Informative & well-balanced.",
      "What I really like about IMDb isn't just the comprehensive information about movies, but also that I can look up movie showtimes and theaters along with buy tickets too. I also like that I can stream films in which some of the ones available for streaming are free. I do think that the links to locate movie theaters and film times is a bit obscure and that this feature should more visible or blatant. Other than that, this is a great application.",
      "IMDb has gotten steadily worse over the last few years. It was at one point an extremely efficient way to look up movies and actors, to see what critics had to say about them, and to run through upcoming trailers. I found some of my favorite movies that way. All of those things still exist, but they are drowning in unnecessary schlock/ads/\"news\" on celebrities. Do you like Facebook? Well, this is like that, except take out all of the people you know and make it worse. Also it's yellow.",
      "Esta muy bueno. Ofrece muchos programas para todas las edades. Tambien las noticias deĺ dia. Informacion sobre la pandemia. Which is very helpful!! Thanks to all of you for your hard work especially on stay home days!!",
      "Good ap but somewhat a pale shadow of the website. An old review of mine was fixed: viz - Fix this disastrous update! No pics! Yes, may I add to the chorus of complaints that on my tablet (Huawei android v7) not a single picture of any sort now appears [except the ads!]. So not quite an advertisers dream. Videos like trailers do however play OK, despite the fronting still appearing blank. Someone's face is red right now (I hope)"

      "Works good so far. The only thing you guys need to work on across all platforms is flagging what is new and repeat. I have loads of shows that record all because you don't have them flagged like you do on the normal boxes. Causes us to figure out what to watch new and not. It's set on new but you don't have the shows flagged please work on this. also on the firestick the audio on your app gets out of sync sometimes too. That's our only issues so far. Thanks!",
      "The short version; The channel guide is horrible. I really only watch maybe 20 channels, but I have to scroll through a ba-jillion channels to find what I want to watch. I may return to the service I was using before because of it. The long version; I have concerns about the ATT Now TV service, I'm not sure they will be around much longer. That and other minor concerns sent me looking for another TV service, and since I have EPB I decided to give it a try. The service is good, though for some reason the faces on some programs like the news seem washed out vs switching back and forth to ATT and looking at the same show. My main complaint is the guide. I can not exaggerate how much I despise the guide. Having to scroll through all the channels to find a program is unacceptable. Very few STB's have numeric keypads, and that makes the problem even worse. I will decide over the next couple of days if I can live with this or cancel and return to ATT Now service. EPB, make the program guide so it can be tailored for favorites. Perhaps even different guides for different users in the house. PP4x4",
      "I'm loving the speed, no boxes, and being able to use my own devices ( down from 4 remotes to just 1). I would like on the guide section or some where in setting fit a place for favorite channels, that way I can go straight to the channels I watch most.....hoping this is addressed soon. Also I can't find the CW shows that I try to record because when I go to the guide and back up it goes from 305 to 307.......No 306?",
      "Don't waste your time going with the streaming service. It is NOT ready. It even keeps getting worse!! I am a long time EPBfi customer and have tried to hang in there, but I just can't anymore. Time to find a better service. Zero or negative stars would be more appropriate.",

      "Mainly use it for the remote function for our TV. Pretty good since you have the option for keyboard, touch pad, and normal TV remote layout. In a lot of ways better than the physical remote, as you can make some selections without disrupting the image on the TV, i.e menus, app selections.",
      "This app is missing one thing, and thats the ability to allow you to connect a headset to your phone, while video is playing on your tv and get the audio thru your phones headset as if it was a bluetooth headset. When video is streamed from phone, it might work, but doesnt when its played from tv.",
      "Too bad it won't turn my blu ray on, even though I set it to allow remote start. A useful feature would have been to sync the screen mirroring functions of my devices so that I could throw video from my phone with one touch.",
      "Hello, I used this app in my Xperia 1 to watch all my videos. But this app not supported HDR when I play. And it work in HDR when I zoom video only. Can you solve it? I want It play video in HDR. Thanks",
      "The app works well enough when connected. However, like someone mentioned at the beginning of October, the app will disconnect you after only a few minutes of not using it constantly. Once you are disconnected, it will not reconnect, unless maybe you uninstall the whole thing and start from scratch."
