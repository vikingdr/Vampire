      "Has earned a spot as one of my ultimate go-to apps for normal to obscure video playback, easily on par with VLC player...BROAD video extention playback compatibility/support, very stable runtime, 10/10 settings customizabilty, & all while lacking a noticeable presence of advertisement. Definitely recommend this to anyone & can't wait to see what else you do with it. Great work, Thank you!!!",
      "Update: Don't face any problems now. Awesome app. Original: I love the app. But I have one complaint. When connected to a Bluetooth headset (Sennheiser HD 4.40BT) I find some latency between the audio and video in this app. Things work perfectly in YouTube and MXPlayer so I don't think it's a hardware problem. Would be great if that could be fixed.",
      "I have been using it for a couple of years its the best both Vedeo and music player.One day when i tried to a make a music play list it suddenly dinied me access and stopped functioning i tried to clear data and force to stop openned the app same issue ,,i just could not rate 5starts unless the problem is fixed...am waiting for your update and big time i uninstalled it several times the app is showing me same promblem of closing itself when i Make a playlist.,...i dont knw why ?!!",
      "Every time I try to play a video it start buffing for a long time and I had to back out to again play again to make it play. Yes, it doesn't matter what video you are watching it occurs constantly. Everything you said I type it, I even restarted my phone from factory and, still had issues with it,",
      "I love this app so much that I kept it for 9 months now, can I recommend some changes to the home for some more exciting designs or textures. Still the best video player app I have ever used.. If your asking me for a better video player app, I totally recommend this app for you!"

      "Edit: taking away two stars because it has been crashing on me for the last 3 months. I can't edit any videos as it crashes and when I reopen it, all the work I have done is gone and I have to start over. VERY frustrating. Might cancel my subscription and delete the app at this point but I keep holding out hope that it will be fixed. Previous review: I love it. I wish you could make clips a little faster than 2x. but it's really great. I use it almost daily for my videos for my Instagram.",
      "Easy to use! The only things I'd like to see is an 'undo' icon,and the ability to zoom in on added tools, for editing purposes. My fingers have difficulty getting things precisely where I want them, but overall, I just did in half an hour what another app took me hours to do! I only just started to use this but it's already awesome!",
      "YouCut is generally a really good tool to use. It is quite easy to manage with even the most basic of editing skills. My drawback though is the precision. In stances, I am unable to trim a clip down to the seconds I'd want it to play. Also, there isn't an option to fade in and out text. But, it is a really good starter kit.",
      "Never fails... always free! Took a bit to learn to navigate the app, but EVERYTHING you need is there... just figure it out! I actually thought maybe I should try one of the PAY video editing apps, thinking they SURELY have more to offer, right?? WRONG! You can pay a monthly fee to have all the same capabilities... but, I prefer to get them from YouCut...for FREE.",
      "I've used this app a few times for adding backgrounds and text to videos that I would upload to Instagram, and it worked perfectly for that. However over the past few days that I've been using it, it hasn't managed to successfully export a video, and instead says 'Video Conversion Failed'. I've tried clearing the cache and I've reinstalled the app as well as cleared my data for it but nothing seems to be working which has rendered this app useless."

      "I can do so much without paying anything, and even more with a subscription. Three stars though because either I keep getting shut out of the app, or tools that used to work just stop working and then start working again. I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall the app, but that's probably because I'm using it on my Chromebook and no a mobile device or PC. Can someone please fix a problem I have where I used to be able to overlay videos and now I can only add images?",
      "Good in some ways, lacking in others. Pros: Pretty easy to use, good features like flipping, cropping, speed, etc. Simply layout pretty good for phone. Can combine videos easily. Cons: Paid option only removes watermark, doesn't really give you many other benefits. Can't add my own watermark to the video which is a HUGE downside for me. Can't blur or censor anything. Have to do a bunch of weird things with stickers and masking. Which is doable, but really not ideal. Only one layer. So I can't seem to add anything that lasts the duration of the video once I've put in other items. So, I added stickers where I needed to blur something out, and then couldn't add a title card to cover the length of the video to act as a watermark. And then when you're working in that layer, you can't lock the items that are in the correct places, so they easily get moved around. Overall, I will not renew my paid option, and won't use past that point.",
      "WOW! This app is unreal. I've been using it to compile quick videos on the flight home from vacations, and it's perfect. Simple to use, enough flexibility to make the video I want without being totally overwhelmed by a million options I'd never use anyway, and all packaged so intuitively. I don't really need any of the in-app purchases/upgrades, but I may buy some just to support the product. Thx a million!",
      "It's a great app. It does all the video editing needs I need. I hate all these other softwares that are portrait mode only and only allow you to splice clips together. This is a full video editing package and it works! Triming multiple clips,, setting everything up on a timeline, it's all there. There're some problems though, like how the audio waves are out of sync with the audio you hear on playback, but this seems to have been fixed with the update Also, my exported files are far too big.",
      "EVERY TIME I try to export a video it always cancels the exporting at 79% and I don't know why I've tried to delete current images I don't need in my camera and my video, searching up why this is happening, and what I don't get is it has never done this to any of my past videos and my past videos were longer than the one that won't export."

      "It was nice that they gave a few days to try their effects for free, but the video I made wouldn't have been worth 25 dollars a month. The images I use \"spasm\" continuously with bluriness and the fact that you can keep an image on for 10 seconds only made it harder for me to edit. I also had some issues with the text not showing after saving. The music was nice though",
      "Really good app! It works very good, except sometimes it doesn't download your video, or edit immediately. Also, sometimes it only downloads half the video and the rest goes all black. But, other than that, It's a very good app! I enjoy it! I use it for all, if not. MOST of my edits. I recommend using this app. 🤗",
      "I would give it 5 stars but it does have some disadvantages, for example for the people looking to edit videos and make picture edits, this app is great for you if u have patience. The only disadvantage I have on this app is the space it takes up like 28.98 gigs is a little much.",
      "One of the worst apps I have ever used, I don't know why it has a good rating!!! I had to remake the video over 10 times!!! Eventually I lost hope and deleted the app. There's no way to save your progress, so anything happens you have to start from the beginning! My screen went off for a second and I lost everything!! It crashed multiple times, and I had to start all over again. Thank you for one of the worst app experience in my life.",
      "App is so good so far.... I will give you 5⭐ after you add app where you can can speed video, reverse video, add voice changes in videos, add some SFX which you can choose some logos or pointers when editing video....... I like this app so much it performs miracles....... Hope my recommendation will reach up to you. Thanks"

I use it to chromecast (which occasionally doesn't work but it's usually fixed by closing and re-opening) or for last ditch distractions while or and about. So good to not have to work about the content my son could come across. Very well designed to!",
      "This such a great app. My 3 year old has no trouble using it, there are a lot of great shows and some very educational in regards to science and nutrition. I really like that the app has a lot of shows he enjoys that aren't available on our local channel.",
      "This app has not let me or my toddler down. It has always been reliable with the latest episodes even before they air on Mondays. The app has helped us on long car trips and she absolutely loves to see her Elmo, Cat and discover new shows like odd squad and Xavier riddle.",
      "My favorite kids video app ever! Even as a grown up I enjoy the videos when I watch with my kids. Everything is age appropriate and fun. Productions are super high quality they are all well thought and produced.",
      "Love PBS, grew up with it and i'm amazed with all the shows that are still going that my son can now enjoy. Unfortunately shows like Fetch (not the Ruff Ruffman Show) and Peep aren't on the app and the ones that my son watches like Cyberchase and Wild Kratts only have a few full episodes on it."

      "So far it is excellent! It is intuitive and renders quickly. Does Not ask for my birthday and other personal information just to make it work. I appreciate that. One comment, not even a criticism. There is just a small, momentary, chyron in the upper corner at the beginning of my video but I don't mind letting credit go to the developers. It is a good app and they deserve it. I wish more app developers made actually good products like this. Great work guys. Thank you.",
      "This App could be the Boss Of Video Editors the big problem is we can't move or insert a video clip to the front at the beginning of project. Yes it can be done but any extra works below (clips) won't slide perfect alignment W/video above project. On the subject, extra below clips like diff snd formats make big loud static noise not the actual snd clip . 1 solution stop stacking snd clips together. Unfortunately even doing that with still make static noise from certain snd files. Fix Pls",
      "Great for editing videos quickly. Fiddle around with it a few times and you'll be good at making edits quick and efficiently. I'm happy with the ability to control the level of the filter as well as having cool filter options.",
      "I edit video but when i extracte to gallery or tries to upload on any social media the extracted video dosent look as i edited..hence the song timing gets changes and video dosent go according to the song..it gets 2-5 seconds of gap between song and clip  And at the end all your efforts will get wastes when uh will extract or download it to the gallery",
      "Easy so far! Project successes! Wish I could figure out how to not cut to black when I cut out parts. When I mess with the transition, it just allows me to lengthen and make the cut more obvious. Any help?"

      "Good app for video editing. We can edit any type of video easily with the help of this app.",
      "I'm a pro using a simple test to compare several editors: Take a .wav file put black over it, with white text over that. (This could show lyrics for a song, for example). This app failed at step one because there was no way to create black. In general, this app is problematic for anyone who wants to make a slightly serious video because you must have a video clip to start a project. I don't recommend this program.",
      "Finally after trying several other apps.. i found this is the best for me..No Reducing Quality but the Size as it is.. Not like others.. Cut the Video..High Quality yet.. no difference or reducing the File size as it should have less size than the Original video. So.. after all.. This App is Simple, Easy and Effective! 🇲🇲💯 ONE MORE THING! THE SPEED IS UNBELIEVABLE!",
      "Pros: 1) This app is really easy to use. 2)Androvid can easily merge, edit and produce videos without much worries. Cons: The only problem I found is that the video quality might reduce depending on the resolution you choose to produce it in.",
      "It's a great app for doing that I want to do. It's the best one, the only one that really give you access to the best trim, slow & ff, edit tools. Problem is a lot of times my videos won't save, that somehow error instead. A lot of my older videos in Google photos don't pull up like they're supposed to so I can't edit them. And in trim it seems like it would better show you what time your at in the clip so it's easier to determine where you start/end it. There's some confusing way that it shows"

      "It definitely does what it's supposed to but I've noticed a couple things. If you try to string together more than 25-30 seconds of footage from different clips, sometimes Inshot freezes & locks up. It may have to do with my phone's memory & processing power also but as this does not occur all the time, I suspect it's the app. Also, when I add text to a video it sometimes doesn't look good after saving it...the text looks jagged, as if it's a low-quality JPEG file. This should be looked into.",
      "This is a pretty decent video editor. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I can only add an edit on the whole video and not part of it. For example I can't have the video sped up on just one part I can only make it sped up on the whole video. Same thing for zooming in on a certain part of the screen. Can't animate anything either.",
      "I recommend this app to EVERYONE!!! Literally you can resize for your instagram stories so they don't get cut off. You can resize for a post so IT doesn't get cut off either. You can add music, you can do it all with this app. I even paid to get the watermark removed, SO WORTH IT! My only qualm is that I wish you could speed things up 10x. That's my only wish for this app!",
      "I started using this app on my Apple device and I liked it so much that I bought two licenses for different devices. However, when I switched to OnePlus, I realised that InShot doesn't have the same transitions for Android. I was disappointed to see that there are actually no video transitions - even for pro members. It has only video effects. The whole purpose of me buying the app was the transitions because I could actually edit a proper professional looking video on my phone.",
      "It has more features than most free video editing apps, but it it also good for shorter videos as well as long ones. You can quickly make a few small adjustments to video clips and then you can make an entire vlog if you wanted to. Overall this app is my favorite one to edit my videos for school and daily life."

But when I looked to open up the video there was a problem with the video it said. I had spent close to 30 mins recording that and now I don't have that anymore because of what? I'd like an explanation please. Good day. 😡 Not pleased with this app, even though it's rating was pretty high.",
      "Immediately after setting it up I tested it and it records the audio nicely and the picture looks great!! I know this is tmi, but I was relieving myself as I was testing it and it picked up that as well lol. You have quick access to record and you can move the tiny icon anywhere on your screen which is fantastic! Would definitely recommend. Obviously there was an ad, but it doesn't seem like it is going to be an issue.",

It then would only save one of them to my camera roll and I was unable to email them to myself, it would only email a link that takes you to a page to download the app. It then decided to delete one of the videos out of the blue without me doing anything! So I lost it altogether. Not impressed.",
      "I enjoy the record option can be on your screen and in the way of your other allow they are open. Which allowed your to screen recked without having to open the all every single time. Videos automatically, superior quality, with range of options and settings. Best last is: this attached to the inshot app, is already installed. So no there is not two app. Just an upgrade 😉",
      "The app is awesome but the only thing is that they need to add a feature so you can delete something in the middle of the video and leave the rest and not just trim the ends. For example, if I was making a vid of me playing a game, then someone txt me in the middle, I would want to cut the part where they text me and leave the rest up. Please add this"

      "Hi, I have to say that this is my 5th year of using the app and I have enjoyed so far. The best app so far I have trusted. One thing I like the app is that it has now improved with nice quality, quick save video and other stuff. One thing I do not enjoy is the emojis that are not similarly in their own shapes. I mean let's say each of the emojis have background squares. If I want to use an emoji I can't get rid of the background color square shapes. Hard to explain but I know you get it. 4 stars",
      "Horrible. Once I finished editing and rendering I chose the option to post on Facebook. After it connected me to Facebook I spent a good amount of time writing the description. I hit the \"post\" button and it began to supposedly upload to Facebook then after about a minute the page refreshes and then all the description vanished and like a total newbie I failed to copy and paste all the verbiage because I trusted this app. After downloading this app it also scrambled parts of my photos & videos",
      "I enjoyed the app at first and had it for several months. I didnt need much help from customer service at the time because it functioned well. Then, I purchased a year membership for VIP/Premium and I have had issues and cannot seem to get customer service to help me resolve the issues. I will UPDATE if anything changes and I'm happy! I have sent multiple emails describing the issues with screenshots as instructed but still NO response! This has been going on for over a week",
      "I love this video editor, but there is a problem! When I try to publish my video to Youtube it gets exported 100% to Youtube and then when I preview the video to see what I want it to look like the screen is black through the whole video when the clips have action and life in them! Plus when I go into Videoshow it shows a black screen through the whole video but before when I export the video, it shows the life in the clips I took Fix this because this has been a big problem for a while for me!",
      "This app is amazing. I made edits for my girlfriend and she loves them!!! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there wasn't a 2nd option to remove the watermark, which i would've really loved. If you can give me a way to remove the watermark without having to pay 60 bucks, I'll be happy to give it 5 stars"

      "Another morin developer app. Forces music in your video with no way to turn it off. Also has lots of transition effects but NO FADE IN OR OUT. Grade = F. Uninstalled.",
      "Great app just wish it had ease in and out slides which will make it greater. But other than that awesome.",
      "I never actually write a comment when I rate an app but this one, I am so impressed! I've been waiting for a clever Dev. to combine each feature here and keep it simple, practical, and just absolutely what I wanted. To top it off ... No blaring ads and when I got done with my creative process no fee for this and no fee for that. Mmmwah! Thank you!"

I really liked the editing effects but if your video can't even save then what's the point. Useless app",
      "Unfortunately Ive not been able to go beyond selecting an existing file to edit. When clicking both tabs [video/photo] the grid which should be showing the preview of your file remains a grid of gray boxes and file timestamps. I can select a file and open it. Select a video, screen is black and play functions/features don't work when clicked. Select a photo, same deal. 2stars for aesthetic and +3stars if I can work off some suggestions and resolve the issue. NOTE 10 Plus.",
      "I haven't even got to fully try out the app yet, I'm just doing this because I literally can't do anything without a pop up asking me to \"rate five stars to unlock premium features!\" I'm literally just comparing filters. I don't need to be asked that 12 times in 3 filters damn. Though from what I can see it is one of the better free versions of a video editor on the play store.",
      "I would love to rate this 5 stars but unfortunately as great of an app it is, I was trying to make an edit and I'm 2 hours into making it and the app just exits out. I lost all my progress and now I cant even do what I needed to do. it was looking great. it has nice effects and transitions and then all my progress is just gone. I'm beyond angry and I'm going to be honest, on the verge of a mental breakdown because it was something very important and now 2 hours of my life have been wasted.",
      "I really really like the app i have used for such a long time now, you can now easily edit vids without any problem the only thing i have to suggest is is doesn't have a undo button on the FX so i always struggle. But hopefully you guys can fix itシ!!!"

      "The new updates are terrible. They make the product almost completely unusable compared to previous versions. It should not take 10 seconds or more to load a playlist, and I don't care how many tracks there are on the playlist. Playlists linger after I have tried to delete them. The only thing the updates have fixed is blank playlists showing up. That's still simply not good enough if the trade off is an app that lags so much you're considering using the crappy pre-installed app. Nonsense.",
      "Dysfunctional, Frustrating! Lame Settings. Paused video disonnects casting and begins playing on my tablet at a random time or another video! Timeline repeatedly vanishes and makes resuming video at select points frustrating and embarrassing (audiences). Highly over rated app. Does not play well on my Samsung tablet. Okay to watch a non-stop video but stop and go doesn't conform to a pleasant experience. Nothing like the computer version. Icon signifies that you should avoid this half baked app.",
      "I really love this app, I've been using it for a good 6 years now downloading it on every new phone I bought. Love the playback speed option, the ability to slow music tempo and keep the same tone of the song is a very nice feature, I just wish it kept the sound quality too. Other than that..its a very great app VLC",
      "Resize options are all the same aspect ratio, showing the same vertically stretched picture for lots of videos, except 3:4 which is not helping . Most 4K videos, mkv, gets stretched. HD movies also get stretched if I use another player, like YouYube, and then go back to VLC. Only way to fix it is to restart the box. That only fix HD though. Tried reinstalling, but no luck. It refuses to show black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Box is MINIX U1",
      "I love VLC. Had it for years on my PC. On the phone Ive stuck with it while it develops and improves. My only problems on the phone are two things. Firstly the auto volume reduction when it thinks the vol is too high. It would be great to disable this. Why ? Because I dont just feed it to headphones. I play back through a Hifi system and its annoying it randomly reduces the volume withiut warning. Two. The auto scrolling of file titles. Really, really annoying when they are long !!!!"

      "there is a problem when you cut and clip or even a part of a clip it doesn't delete the text on that clip but instead put more video on the end of the video and makes all your text go far away from where you originally put it, hope you could fix that with even just a little bit. functions are really easy to use but it does put their watermark on it if you dont have premium but even if i make the video under the time limit it doesn't let me remove the watermark.",
      "Not such a bad app here you can add music, sticker, emojis but I give it 2stars because if you don't have the subscription of \"pro\" you can't use all good features which can disappoint you. In this app you be like, you have enough knowledge but you can't gather it to make you successful. Please change this feature. Give something for free for the beginners. If one can find anything interesting then why one buy the \"pro\" subscription",
      "Overall, I give it a solid 3. When I downloaded it, Everything was good. I could choose the photos. I could even use the sounds out of a video in my gallery💕! Just one problem. This app is legit useless, UNLESS, you buy the freaking PRO. And I'm hella broke👀! All the free transitions are horrible. Half of this app is for the PRO thing, and I hate it😡. I would recommend it if your down to waste your money , but if you dont wanna, dont download this. If you fix this maybe I'll give you a 5💫!😬",
      "It's a very good app! And I like it its good for editing! I would have given this app 5 stars but...to ME! It seems like all the good features, you have to be a pro! Like literally all the good ones you have to be a pro! You could have at least given us some good features instead of it all being pro, like seriously! All the plain ones are ok but the ones that make the vid pop! are not fee! Like y'all want money that bad? But all I'm saying is please let there be some good features that are FREE!",
      "Was a very awesome app, until everything just started messing up. Audio automatically trims to 0:00 when I even touch the trim button. Some frames that I put in I can't even touch. Now random frames are invisible (as in I can see them in the display screen but not in the actual trimming area) and I can't delete them or touch them. Fix these please!"

      "I've had this app through my last 5 phones and I tried out about 20 other video apps and they all seem to have the same problem the sound doesn't line up with the video or the video crashes and get stuck or the quality diminishes after you edit it ,but this app is easy it's Crystal clear it's fast and I have just a cheap Android phone. This app has no issues at all everything runs perfectly smooth. I'm getting a new phone soon and first thing I'm going to do is install this app",
      "When this App actually works, it's great. I use it to merge multiple videos and it's very handy. However, I paid for Premium and a good 50% of the time, I'll finish putting together a video and go to export it in 720p or higher and it won't let me because it doesn't recognise that I have a Premium account. It's usually fixed by shutting the app down and then opening it again but the work I've done putting together the video is now gone to waste. It's very frustrating.",
      "It is good. I can download HD by just watching ad. But too many bugs. 1. I saved a draft of my video with subtitles. Next day when I opened, all my subtitles are misplaced. Again I need to type all my subtitles and export it immediately. 2. Sometimes I get phone memory full while exporting my video. So I connect my phone to pc and transfer other files (not the files which included in video). When I go to draft to edit again, most of my files are missing 3.Some transitions are not smooth.. fix it",
      "I love this app. It's great but after I made payment for the premium and wanted to save my video. I was asked to pay the premium again only then I can save it. Like I've never made any payment before. Then I didn't proceed to save it as why should I pay again when I already made the payment. Dear Developer kindly look into this matter. Thank you",
      "The app is pretty good in its ease of use. When I went to save my work, however, the highest video quality is 1080p. It doesn't make much sense to go through the trouble of using the app only to have your 4K video dropped down to 1080p. If they fix this, I will rewrite my review."

      "By basically every account, this is facetime, but for Android. It even has the same logo. That being said, it works really well. The preview you get when a call comes in is nice, the video quality is usually good (enough) and if not, it usually fixes itself quickly. I would like it if more people were on it, or if it had a screen share feature, but it is unlikely someone uses it if you don't tell them about it, and I have yet to see a screen share. Overall, I recommend using it, 9/10",
      "This app used to work just fine for me and I don't know what happened since then or if it was an update but my camera has been stretched sideways. I've done everything to try to fix this issue; i have restarted the app, restarted my phone, and i tried deleting and re-downloading the app. Nothing has worked to fix this issue. I have an android and all my friends have iOS, and duo used to make things easier for us to be able to video call, but with this issue video chatting is not as easy.",
      "I've had duo for a couple years now it has all pressure served me well. I've got all my friends to download it I if they don't have it. I've tried other video callers but they just didn't measure up to the quality that duo brings. Good connections clear video no dropped calls or those videos lags where people doing like there being chopped and screwed it's the best out there you want the best then download duo and you will have the best",
      "Wont connect with other party. My wife and I used Duo all the time, and in December 2019, we purchased Galaxy Note 10's. Sine then, it wont even connect. You get the ring, you pick up, then nothing. Used to be our go to way of communicating, but it's been useless since.",
      "That's great. It's easy to use. You can also connect with your loved one. It works well for people who don't use social media. Everyone should use it! One suggestion is: How much fun it would be to add stickers when making a video call! Anyway, it's very easy to use. So, I like it very much❣️❣️"

      "This app is really good and it is very helpful for editing and it has a diversity of transitions ,effects etc.But I am only opposed to the fact that you have to pay most of them and also to remove the watermark you have to pay for it ,but it is a really simple and amazing app!",
      "I like this app a lot! It has fun transitions, good audios, and it's fun way to see what your friends are up to. I don't really enjoy the fact that when you watch the video you make, it always has a lag. Also, even when I'm on WiFi, the app is kind of slow. But for the most part, I love this app!",
      "I love using this more than vinkle. But there is a minor problem. If you use certain transitions and effects, it caused the editor to be laggy once you play that part or come accross the part with that certain transition/effect. That then causes it to become desyncronized in the editor but no when you're finished editing. I also don't like the fact that there's a pro feature for which you have to pay for either weekly or monthly. Other than that, it's still a pretty good app",
      "Free version has a huge WATERMARK in the middle of the screen, and has a video LENGTH LIMIT of \"180 seconds\" aka 2 minutes. There is clip copying, splitting, cropping, some filters, transitions, and hue shift. There are no other basic features, such as speed control or clip rotation. Devs, don't respond. This is for people comparing editors, to save them the hassle of downloading 100 apps.",
      "This app is ok. It used to be amazing! But then their was like a update or something that you can't use the whole song of something when you edit a vid. And you used to be able too BEFORE this all happened. Also I would make edits like everyday and now I really can't. This is really aggravating LIKE ALOT. Now I'm really mad & Idk what to do please this became honestly annoying I'm about to make this rate smaller... sorry just my opinion and some truth period! If you could go back pls do"

      "Vinkle is a very good video transition app! It lets you use photos you have got and makes a transition for you (although you can choose which one you would like it to make for you) and makes it an amazing app for Android. I use it all the time for making edits for my social medias and I really cannot complain! Keep it up with the outstanding work: hope to see lots more new features soon!",
      "It's overall a great app. It's easy to use and it makes great edits for you. But I think you should add something to it like funimate where you can pick transitions and sound to make your OWN edits. So you can have the best of both worlds lol. But other than that yea its great",
      "This is amazing it's easy very high quality and very easy to work and save I would recommend this app but there's one little problem it kicks you out a lot portal take you to the app store it's really frustrating and annoying some videos get lost also there's only three options for each of the categories other than that I would right this 5 Stars if it's those little problems weren't there other than that this app is a very nice and high-quality I do recommend but please fix these problems",
      "I do recommend using. One thing I will say is that I wish you didn't need premium to use some of the music, cause I've gotten good ideas with certain songs, but I couldn't use them because of premium. Besides that, the overall app is amazing!! I love this app and it's really easy to figure out once you get used to it. Great work!!",
      "There's this audio I want to use and it says you have to watch an ad to get it for free. And I did, multiple times but they would request me to watch another an another. It's like you're getting money from me watching ads and never getting the audio I wanted."

      "I really like it! I even got the premium version, but I preferred the previous version because it was easier to use and more fun in my opinion. A problem is that it bugs out a lot when it comes to text, effects and music: it tends to delete text or place it randomly in the video once you add a clip, which makes it more annoying to edit. Overall, great app!",
      "Hi, I really enjoy this app but whenever I export a video it becomes very blurred, which really lowers the quality of the video compared to when it was on draft. This used to not be a problem until the recent updates. I shouldn't have to pay money to have my videos come out in an acceptable manner. It feels like you purposefully have lowered the quality of videos after export so we would have to pay for the VIP service just to have a video in the average quality. I think this should be fixed.",
      "Vivavideo is a short video editor so for those of us who work and create extended videos this is not the app for you. Also you don't get a lot of filter options if you do not purchase a subscription as well as you will be subjected to low quality display. This app would take a lot of storage space on your phone and does not fully function properly if you attempt to save creations to SD Card. They do have neat filters compared to others. This would be a great app if some things can be improved.",
      "Sometimes when I go to make a video, it automatically removes the watermark and says it's a free trial. But then when I go to add the watermark, it doesn't let me and it says I need Premium to remove the watermark when I'm trying to add it. Also, sometimes when I save the video, it glitches and removes a translation or uses half of the translation. I think this app could use more translations too.",
      "Cant use VIP without signing out over and over again; Followed Troubleshooting steps, I have contacted developers without any response as of yet. Its been going on for over a month now can't add text to projects. I will now be asking for refund and seeking better apps by different developers that actually care about their products. I've had the same phone...haven't changed."

      "Just the app I was looking for. I will give 5 stars if I can figure out how to add multiple songs. I'm usually pretty good at this stuff but I tried for a whole day and when I add a song and set start and end time it take the previous song off. Also arranging pics should be a little easier when you have a large amount. For some reason when I try to arrange they are jumping everywhere. I have around 200 photos and 3 or 4 songs I need to work with. Also wish there were more effects Thanks",
      "I love this app. I love that I can make almost everything with my videos. But being honest, I dont understand why sometimes, when I export the video, the quality is not good, even if I choose HD. The original video is great in quality, but after I edited the video and export it, it looks all pixelated. Not all the times, but mist of the times. Any suggestions so I get a better quality? Still, I love this app.",
      "Dear developers the app seems to have most of the features I am looking for. But one major issue is that the ordering of photos and videos is not happening properly. The order keeps messing up. Working with more than 50 pics and videos and ending up with a messed up order has wasted so much of my time! Please fix it. Also if I keep reordering some videos and photos disappear or get duplicated. Please fix.",
      "My card was charged 3 times, and it wasnt the card i set the account with. But after taking payment it went to my other card and charged that card. Even after getting payment. My first time putting my card on here and i knew this is what i was afraid of happening. I just need a refund on the other card...",
      "At first I thought it was not free . But it's truly free app. I just tried making only one video and in that video it was like very nice all the features are very nice and on the basis of first video, I am rating it on five on five"

      "Excellent app. Really happy that I can use the full functionality in the trial version, no quality reduction or feature restriction. I have never found a video editor for Android with this much functionality. The ability to stitch together so many clips, add titles, color effects, transitions, and even minor audio processing is more than I ever thought possible from a mobile platform. Highly useful, and I highly recommend to anyone trying to do YouTube or Instagram content.",
      "Not too fond of the fact that there's a monthly payment for getting the ability to export more than 3 videos. I personally think that unlimited exportation should be a free feature, and the subscription should give higher export quality options and possibly the ability to export multiple videos at once, and leave it at one video can be exported if using the free version. Obviously, this doesn't have to change, it's just my two cents on the app. Regardless of my main problem, it's perfectly fine",
      "This app is really good (5 stars for UI and usability) but I can not use it because of 2 exports limitations. Suggestion- You can show ads each time a user wants to export a video. It will benefit both- user and you. Your rating will also improve. At present, you are simply loosing all your rating because of video export limitation.",
      "Good app. Easy to use. But freezes and lags a lot. App crashed several times whilst using it. Nothing was lost as it audo saves... But it's frustrating. Might need some bug updates to overcome this. Otherwise happy with this app for simple social media video editing.",
      "This is a phenominal mobile video editor, but sereously, you can only export 3 videos before you have to buy the premium. Absolutey horrible, why? Why cant you use ads or make it a one time payment?? Please, consider those options, ads/one time payment. Thank you for listening."

      "Most awful editing app I've ever used. An AI does the editing, not yourself. The process of rendering takes 5 minutes for a 30 second video, and you can't download the video unless you buy their \"premium membership\" which is $5 a month. Don't waste your time buying this garbage. It will also bug you to death by asking you to verify your email. Magisto has to be the most annoying application I have used so far in my mobile device experience.",
      "First thing worth a mention - you can not download or share videos you have made, unless you subscribe. Subscription is crazily overpriced. The AI is not as clever as the developers might think, though sometimes it is not terrible. Lot of bugs. Videos always play from 0:02 when played in app. You have to be online to use the app...",
      "Absolutely amazing, if you're not so computer savvy you need this app because it creates memorable videos using your videos and photos that you select, how it works I have no idea, all I can say is that it's one of the best apps I've used, I used to use flippagram on my old iPhone but that is no match for Magisto. I really don't like this app, I love it😁",
      "The worst app I ever used. Even for trial we couldn't add more photos and changes it's not saving. Waste of time.",

      "I was going to give it 5 stars but on the latest upgrade I'm unable to stretch the music through the length of the video. Please fix this so I can change the rating. I tried several times. The first song plays after that the music doesn't save the other or copied tracks. Please make changes to that feature. It worked perfectly when I first downloaded the app a few months ago and paid for the upgrade.",
      "Whenever I got done editing, at some parts it just showed grey and a few colors at the top. I checked to see if it was my phone and it was your editor, I recommend you fix this, because you don't know how long that video took to make, and this has happened multiple times, fix it, please and thank you.",
      "Limits: One audio track, no pip, no audio fade. No custom background. Good: Zoomable timeline! Watermark removed by ads. Good UI on clip import. Speed (1/2x to 2x); volume adjust; \"crop\" tool includes zoom, warp, flip, arbitrary rotation; great photomanip includes white balance, saturation, contrast; clip reverse; text feature is easy and plenty of options, including animations; No apparent limits on exporting, file size, text/image layers. Paid options can be \"bought\" with ads. Best so far.",
      "Alright so all I used was the trimming feature to cut some sections of the video, I changed a section of the video to black and white for about 6 seconds, slowed down the video and muted it, I used text for a certain amount of seconds every few trimmed section. And in the final product, no bloody audio came through. Inside the app I can hear it but every time I export it the video has no audio at all.",
      "When I used this app it removed my audio that I had in it while I was editing! Other then that it's an amazing app!!! Okay so it was the actual sound I had with the video when I was recording. Then I added music to it and I was watching the video over again in the app and it sounded fine until I downloaded it to my camera app. I decided to watch the video with the camera app and half way through the video it was just silent. It was really wierd so that's what happened!"

      "Used to be great before the update! Since the latest update, its total trash! Constantly freezes. Unable to do a voiceover because you cant see whats happening on the screen because of the freezes. If you go with the free version you may not be too disappointed, but Ive got the paid version and cant even use this. Totally worthless! If I had written this review before the last update, Id have given it 5 stars!",
      "I am a premium user and I really do enjoy using this app. However there are some things I wish were added. The ability to multi-select videos instead of having to click on each video to delete them. It's a hassle to press each video I've edited to delete them. Another one is zoomed in video animation. How the layer system has a feature to set key tracking for photos and text. If I could do that with a zoomed in video I would give this app 5 stars.",
      "I hate it, I would've given it 5/4 stars, but for 3 days know, I don't know why.. When I am exporting, it randomly closes down on me, I loved this app From the start, but now, just why? Please fix this as fast as I can, my subsribers and waiting and I can't just wait and keep trying forever, I am not a hater! Just please.. Fix it........",
      "Well kimemaster is very good for me because I'm an youtuber a gacha youtuber. And it's very good for editing or just playing around. Its perfect for beginners like me 😁 but there's one thing I don't like about this app...its that when you have a max to limited space to export. Like it's not bad but I need to post daily and when it says \"you can't export any more due to exporting\" that gets me so frustrated so then I have to go to the app store and delete it then get it again. So please fix this",
      "It is a great app. Authough, I do have a very small problem that I want you to fix. It has some bugs when I put media. When I put media I have to wait mabey through 15-20 Minutes to import it. Please fix that problem once you see this review. Anyways about that it is still overall a good app to edit videos! So there is none problems other than that! So I give this review a great four stars! - Allison Felix"

      "The app is just a front-end. I just had the experience, that when submitting to publish, the sync failed. Yet, thankfully, when I logged in to the newly-purchased cloud membership, I found that the actual media / footage did in fact upload, which means that I was able to finish editing from a browser. Edit: A good way to avoid such sync errors seems to be, to exit the editing process before publishing, and then to sync the edit first. After the edit itself has been synced, publishing is less likely to result in an error message.",
      "Worst app in my phone!! Does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! And Dont call it a video editor! Because I cant put glitches and effects with this app!😡 I thought it's a good app but I AM DISAPPOINTED! And plus, THE PRICE IS CRAZILY OVER PRIZE JUST FOR A MONTH! FOR A YEAR, EVEN WORST!😡 149 MYR for a MONTH and 849 MYR for a year! Which is about maybe $20 to $50 and for a YEAR is maybe around $200! I Think you just want to make money!😡 ok so back to it! This is a WORD EDITOR Because it can only edit words!👎",
      "I really enjoy Wevideo I do wish youcould reverse your videos and I wish they had more music selection and effects without having to pay more..Other than that my only issue is that it keeps freezing up on me if you playing it while speedingup the video..Other than that I do wish it was a little cheaper",
      "Super easy to use and I am totally new to this. I wish I could adjust the volume of the background music, and add more than One text box per clip... But i really loved this.",
      "What's up with it saying \"can't play this video\" for no reason than erasing the audio from my videos irreversably? Fix it! Now! So stupid! I am using the app on my chromebook FYI. Edit: now it won't let me preview or download the videos I edit. This app really, really, sucks. I would have upgraded to a better version if I wasn't frightened my $100 would get flushed down the toilet the same way my $3.99 did. I'll shout it from the rooftops: THIS APP SUCKS, DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT"

The downside is that it can't read subtitles embedded in the MKV, however you can manually download subtitles from the Net.. The other downside is that it still can't play 4K HDR vividly, 4K HDR movies have somewhat muted colors.. However non-HDR movies plays with vivid colors.. Thumbs Up !",

Also update the pro version with additional features like regular one. Its just too outdated that it makes no sense buying the pro version.",
      "While playing games the application is freezing and leads to loss the game where in online or in offline. Please fix this issue. And other thing while playing games there is a 2nd chance for playing the game after watching ads but now it isn't available and unable to beat the score and it been difficult to play...,..... Sometimes I think to quit from games. Please don't make and encourage this type of fricky experiments",
      "App is fully scrap, worthless, fully garbage, always showing ads, irrelevant content to users as the users are not interested in those scrap. Every time tapping to new contant it show the ads, once displayed it takes lot of time to restart the content and very frequent ads. MX player will you state that what is the upper extent of spaming, as you are crossing the limit. In now a days very more apps are available and you are behaving like the dominating one in terms of ads content. Garbage App",
      "Good Player but too many ad. I normally watch \"Crime Satark\". Before ad and after ad you get buffering. Many a times after the ad the serial don't start at all. If I exit from the app & try to reconnect again I get same ad and then after buffering. Due to which compulsorily you can't watch the serial as it don't start at all.",
      "Have been using this for years and is a excellent app that plays most video formats and files. I will now be deleting it and trying to find a alternative as all I want is a player that is lightweight and plays LOCAL videos. I do not want notifications of online videos or push feeds, there are plenty of other apps / players for that. It is evolving...into making more money. Shame."

But now I am having an issue with securing my one video of above 3 Gb size .. it doesn't import kindly help with that .. it say 0 of 1 video have been imported every time I try to hide that video .. this is not happening to other smaller aur mid size videos.. is there any size limit ?",
      "Once I figured out my videos had to be on the internal memory all went well. Initially I couldn't get the share option will not work on my S10+, but no issues selecting from the app. Hides all my sensitive things as long as I know what file they are in. The share option now has the Video Locker on it. I have no idea as to why it wasn't initially. I did make some settings but not sure that is why. Oh well it works good. Purchased the lifetime option. Photo Locker was too much.",
      "I love it, it keep record of everything even if you reinstalled it. A very good app for hiding you videos, try it.",
      "My experience with Video locker good storage for any videos you like and you can rename them and put in alphabetical order!",
      "Great until I saved a few videos recently and it's corrupted them ....saved as kB not MB possibly saved only audio of some videos ?? Either way not in the slightest bit happy as the videos are now permanently lost"

      "For the long time that I was using this app I had little problems with it, but recently it keeps bugging and DESTROYS EVERYTHING THAT I WORKED HARD ON! It just suddenly crashes and when I open my work it says that I have to create a new one like it crashed TWICE on my work and I had to restart TWICE! I was working on it for quite a long time and all of a sudden I HAVE TO RESTART ALL OVER AGAIN. Please fix this. This is a good app but the recent bugs made me frustrated.",
      "This app is truly awesome! Extremely easy to use and loaded with features. It took me time to learn how to master applying subtitles but this app allows you to make an art out of it. I can apply multiple subtitles at the same time, have text come out of people's mouths, give the subtitles different effects, etc. One tip: pay the one-time fee, it's about $3.99 or so, to remove the Filmora Go logo from the end of your videos, just to make them look more personalized. But it's a great app!",
      "Seems like an okay app, but I have hundreds of songs on my phone that aren't showing up in the app, thus severely limiting my ability to create the desired vibe. Twenty-ish songs out of a few hundred just doesn't cut it. I have neither the time nor the inclination to reformat all those music files, if that's indeed the issue. Too bad, so sad, we could've been great together FilmoraGo.",
      "This app is like a goldmine with all the things you can accomplish. One thing (two) that I would ask for is the ability to cut videos and to put video over video. Even if I would have to pay a small fee I would. This app is amazing and I definitely recommend it. It does take a while to get the hang of it but after a few days or weeks you'll feel like a pro.",
      "It's quite not bad to use the app until when I tried making a video using pictures and I've encountered a problem that you can't edit or control the motion of the picture which is kind of annoying when I want it to stay still but it keep zooming in and out at any direction it wants. :(( It's my first time using the app so I might don't know how to do it, if there's a way, please kindly inform me."

I hope this can be fixed somehow as this app will by far be the best once properly working. 4/5 stars only because the one issue",
      "It looks good.Effects are great but if you press Save then video is by default saved in lower resolution.Why is there not option to ask us in what for resolution we want that video is saved.My video was full HD 1080px but app lower resolution to 720px and it is not what i would like to have.To repeat it again...Why do not have to us option to chose resolution? Because of that 3 stars... I'm gonna to give you 5 stars after you make changes regarding resolution option during saving of video.",
      "Well I was liking the app when I made my first video. But then when I tried to make another one, it worked, but when I hit save it just said 0 percent at the thing that tells you how much it's saving, and then it sent me back to the glitch editing page. I tried many times but it keeps doing it. Please fix.",
      "I really like the app but one thing confuses me. There's a section where you can \"import\" music. I don't understand it. If you can please give me some help that would be great. Over all great app. Edit~ I have found an app that would work for me... Thank you for your response InShot INC. 😊",

      "Great app... Needs more font options, filters... Also it seems to crash and restart back from where you left off. I don't understand that. Why does your app back you out of a creating to the home screen but then ask to \"Resume\" or Delete ??.. anyway I'm giving you guys a 3 because last time I gave a 4 and I see no improvements thus far. You don't have to be like Facebook or IG- just be Lomotif",

      "This is a very usefull app, and it is so simple to use. Everything about this app is intuitive. It just works as it should and the videos turn out perfect. I really enjoy using this app but I would like to be able to start from the video that I want to use then share with ActionDirector app. Is that a possibliity? Thank you for this great app!",
      "Great product and very easy to use so far this is my go to app for editing video on my phone. After many hous creating many videos I would like to see 3 features. 1. Allow picture in picture or 2 video clips side by side. 2. Allow an option to lock the titles to the video clips instead of the timeline 3. Allow an option for sound to be modified or muted per video clip of section, similar to the action adjustment. There are parts of a video i world like to mute instead only the entire thing.",
      "Very nice app, easy to use. Doesn't allow multiple cuts off one clip, but you can add the same clip again to get the second crop, and so on. Allowed modification of audio for each clip imported. But - lost two points for only being SUBSCRIPTION BASED. Come on. For someone who wants to edit a single video now and then, with no watermark? This software is nowhere near professional trade that would require a subscription. Come on.",
      "I'm a pro using a simple test to compare several editors: Take a .wav file put black over it, with white text over that. (This could show lyrics for a song, for example). This app failed at step one because there was no way to create black. It was also impossible to import a .wav file which was under 2 minutes long. In general, this app is problematic for anyone who wants to make a slightly serious video because you must have a video clip to start a project. I don't recommend this program.",
      "Everything was cool and fine until the latest update....any pictures that are set to be shown less than 1 second in a video...it glitches out and briefly shows the next item and the transitions glitch out. So when I save it to storage, the glitches are saved as part of the video....."

      "Don't use this app This is horrible. I just installed 'V recorder' on March 6, 2020. It came out with a free trial for premium package and then i found out that this app didn't work for me and not match for my requirements so I uninstalled in the same day. 3 days later, my visa card was charged for 2,750 Thai baht by your application without notification!! And i mailed them but no answer, no responsibility at all",
      "Ads right off the bat. The when I tried to close the app and swipe it off the screen it locks up my screen and the only way around it is to reboot my phone. This happened twice within the hour of installing it. Uninstalled. To many other apps that work better than this one.",
      "It's an awesome app for creating videos and adding titles and changes if not satisfied. The problem is that it only allows 3 videos and then you have to choose VIP. That's annoying!!",
      "Honestly great app but now when I record it pops up the premium version everytime I try too record like idc about the watermark or anything I'm just trying too get an app that lets me record something unlike other apps that say pay that too record it's dumb but this app lets do what I want and I like that so thank you but plz let me know how too fix this problem please",
      "I like be that it is so functional and that is easy access except that it cost way too much for me to spend and some buttons are in the way of ending a recording or pausing it overall it's great!!"

      "it does work, but Facebook will not open as it should. You see 3 maybe 4 posts then it tells you to add more friends. That's it!!!. if yr lucky you just catch the posted video you want, if it was posted yesterday you got no chance. Needs work.",

I mean they could of done up to 2 minutes instead of 30 seconds. That's why I gave it three stars instead of five because now I have no use for the app.",
      "I used to REALLY like this app. I've always wanted to make music videos and believe I have a talent for doing so. This allowed me to make videos to my own songs as well as play around with other artists. But I have NO IDEA WHY yall would reduce the max recording time to 30 seconds. That practically takes away ALL the fun that was in it. I can't see myself continuing to use this app because of that. That was real stupid!",
      "I used to like this App a lot, but lately after updating the app, It allows me to record for only 30 seconds and below and thereby reducing the fun of it, also i cant seem to see my old saved videos. Also if it were to be the previous version i would have been able to retrieve my old saved video and later complete it to save it in my gallery, even if i couldnt complete it but now cant seem to find any video even though i have signed in to my account. These explains why i rated it \"1\" star."

      "A very feature rich player. It has everything one may look for in a video player. However, there's one thing I didn't like is that the UI and purple accent everywhere. Please make UI more visually appealing with options to customise and a library system for video player which shows files with meta data and tags like Netflix. I know that is way over the top one actually look for, but this would make it the best and only player with such features.",
      "This is just ok..video settings by this app is amazing& appreciable👏 but we have to adjust settings for every time in some aspects... Lot of improvements needed.. \"remember settings\" feature should be included..and manual brightness without depending on system brightness should also be included.. If so.. It will deserve better ratings..",
      "New version is really bad. Please go back to previous version. I can't move forward more than 24 seconds when I swipe right. When the play bar is on I can't move forward or backward at all. \"All video\" page is a disaster since the clips that I download in Whatsapp or Telegram are shown in there. Exiting the video is so much harder now. KMPlayer is still the best on any platform so fix these problems please!",
      "Love everything about KMplayer! Although, I did discover a minor issue. Player would not play a couple of my AVI movie files. It did play my other AVI files. Also would not play a DIVX movie file. Not a big deal I use another player for those files. Other than that, you guys did a FANTASTIC job with this video player! Thank you!!!!",
      "I've found and used so many video player apps but this player make me so amazing. Adding substitle (especially ass file) into a video made me crazy when I used the old apps but this app can do that easily and quickly with a lot of features and I like that. Everything is good until now."

During the encoding task it doesn't force the phone to stay awake and doesn't ask for permission in the first place, and it stops the task when the phones screen turn off, which means you need to frequently touch the screen every 30min at least so the task is completed, it is a pain in the a** considering the usual long time of these tasks.",
      "Its an okay app but it seems impossible to choose what part of a song you want to add. I wanted to add a middle part of a song but it just played it from the start and there was no way of changing it. It really got me triggered so I deleted the app again. I honestly dont think anyone will find what they're looking for with this app.",
      "Very good app to trim videos. It even trimmed my 4 GB video perfectly well. Only add better controls to select duration of trimming like a manual option to add timing of trimming.",
      "This app is amazing! It does exactly what I was needed it to (trim down a video to less than 1 sec). Thank you so much!",

      "I would like the same effects that iPhone has as an android user. I currently have a S10+ so it is kind of ridiculous. I would also like to add the fact the songs/sound effects don't exactly match up with the videos when editing. Which is a huge problem when trying to time edits. Not sure if these problems are associated with android specifically but these issues should be fixed for a better experience.",
      "There is great potential here, I see this app as an easy 4 stars if this critical problem didn't exist, this app is only crippled by it's force closes and crashes. I can't work on a project without getting a force close or crash, that's why I won't use it until it's improved, for now it gets 1 star from me due to unusability. I'm using a Pixel 4 XL, not a folding phone or a tablet, so I assume these bugs can't be blamed on a weird form factor or screen size.",
      "This app has lots of potential, this could be a great app to use for editing. There are no ads other than when you upload the video to your gallery. However, I was just going to give this app 5 stars until I spent hours editing a video, (keep in mind I checked it before I uploaded it to my gallery and it was fine) I went back to upload it to my YouTube Channel, and behold, every other time I split the video the screen went black. Major waste of time for me. Fix it and I'll give you 5 stars.",
      "This is great app, I prefer this even compared with 5 similar apps. The only thing that I am not happy is there is no way to add other languages fonts, for instance, I wanna make a video for Japanese but I cannot choose or add Japanese fonts. I am happy to buy or get premium to use it so, please fix it...please.",
      "Its cause I can easily edit videos however, when I inserted a clip again it became black. It has the audio but the actual video is complete. It didn't even said that the video isn't supported by the app. I can't edit anymore. I'm still looking for the problem."

      "Finally! A video hider/player that can directly access and play my files on my SD card. All the other I looked at required the user to unhide files in order to view them, which would be a major hassle. This app hides all the files, only viewable from within the program, which is password-protected. The video player is pretty good too (the only thing I would want is to be able to lock audio mute so that I didn't accidentally turn on the volume. Great product!",
      "They hide your photos so well, that they can't find them, just kidding, it's a good app, I've had for quite awhile, but I still need to learn a few more things, like if i erase all my cloud videos, will mine still remain in video hider, i hope so. But i haven't had any problems with this app. Great Security!",

      "This app fail just like any other apps with the same shot offer and the reason is they dont have the option to change the icon or change the app name when you download it in your phone, like i got nothing to hide i dont need this app but just saying its useless app it collects people data and tricks people that their photos or videos or files are safe but in fact secretly will be uploaded in their system right away, i dont care personally now if its true or false this app sucks and failed",

      "Great app. The only issue I have is that I keep preselecting a size as a result and the end results are always way bigger than the target size. I have had to repeat the process on a single, short video numerous times to get the size where needed. That is a bit annoying and time consuming. Any advice?",

Main thing or feature that i like most is it directly supports any kind of file and it shows the file details and graphic aswell. Thanks for your product . but The worst thing that i lost my video sond. It compressed the video removig all sound silent. Plz. Fix it. From 🇳🇵Nepal",
      "Does not work when compressing files to Sdcard. Ran a test on a file that had a file size of 34 mb. Monitored target destination file size for increase. File size increased during compression but when compression finalized the file automatically was removed by the app without warning or notification. Ran same test using three different file sizes. Sdcard has no issues and pleanty of space 512 GB Lexcar Sdcard with 462 GB available. Fully tested with other apps for reading and writing data.",

      "I had fun creating an ad for my business with this app. The process was seamless and very easy. It nearly did all the work for me! The user interface is nice too with everything you need easily accessible. My only gripe is the limited amount of music available but there's an easy remedy for that. I highly recommend Quik especially if you're a beginner.",
      "Great app for creating personalized videos of vacations, trips, family gatherings, celebrations and other memorable moments in life! The only thing that I wish could be added as a feature, is to adjust the duration of each picture manually and to place the text at a random spot in the picture. Also, it would be great to be able to save a certain part of the video that you're happy about, without it adjusting automatically when you make changes in other pictures (hope that that makes sense).",
      "So far I rate it one star because there is no zero! It won't work. It only will download part of my Google photos and then after you've picked some it keeps crashing. Some serious work needs to b done to this app!! I also noticed from the other reviews that this has been happened ng for a while but I don't see any response back for any of them. Why are you ignoring the problem?",
      "What can I say, a different approach from every other editor and it handles 4k videos. One missing thing or something didn't work for me, is to crop/zoom an area of a video, to the same aspect ratio. In that case crop function was selecting all my video area doing nothing. It could allow me to set the new area to crop/zoom. Anyway the best video editor for stories/teasers out there!",
      "stopped working. whenever i select a video or photo to create a video, the app jumps back to the start screen. Update on 29.2.2020 - even after 8 months, the issue is still not resolved. U cant add photos while creating videos. Clearly shows the apathy of the developers. May be go pro is not paying them their salaries or may be this app has been abandoned."

      "I've been using this app for about a month. Once you get used to it it's easy to use and love the gifs! Making my youtube channel fun! Sometimes the language reverts to Chinese I believe but basic knowledge of normal buttons like..ok, cancel, finish.. and you can easily still navigate it. Overall Best app for video edits that I've found so far! Thanks for a great app!",
      "I like it, when it actually works... it wont pull up my gallery anymore..",
      "It said all my photos and videos are unsupported files, that doesn't make sense. The photo are taken on a Samsung phone using normal photo option. Never a problem posting on other apps.",
      "I love the app.. but it doesn't work anymore .all it says that the file is unsupported.. hope it can be fixed but it's a great app."

It's only saving grace, the reason it got a second star, is the teleprompter works well. It's so far a waste of money",
