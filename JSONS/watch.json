      "I got my watch (active 2) for my birthday, of course had to download this app, it worked with no issue then all sudden disconnect itself and stop working couldn't reconnect. After looking it up online from samsung website it said just disconnect and reconnect on the app. So I did and it's been working ever since then without issue. If you have the same problem, just do the same thing as I did and it should work fine from there. I really enjoy this app, it makes things easier.",
      "I absolutely love the Galaxy Wearable watch and how easy and convenient it makes my life easier throughout the day. My only dislike about it is I'm unable to use it for phone calls. It's much easier to use it to receive and send calls than to reach for my phone in a pocket or other places it may be sitting when I need it. Call me lazy if you want but the watch is suppose to make using it COMPLETELY more easily or convenient.",
      "The app won't connect to my devices (Buds & Watch Active) but my phone does recognize them so I'm guessing its an issue from the app. Please fix it for the 5 stars. The app is really great but that issue is really annoying. UPDATE: March 20, 2020 The app still have the same issue and now I realize that its happening really often. PLEASE FIX THIS.",
      "Great app, but with 1 minor issue. As some others have mentioned, there is no way to restrict the use of music apps with the buds+. What this means is, one of the shortcuts will call a music app and you can't change that. The problem with this is, everytime you take out the buds, you will accidentally touch a part that calls the music app. They are very sensitive and this minor issue is a huge annoyance. In most cases it calls the app (Spotify) in my case, and then start playing the last song.",
      "Amazing app, various controls. I would suggest separating custom controls from basic controls (earbuds start playing music from accidentally touching but I use ambient controls). I'd like to separate basic controls like music playing, call controls, and custom controls. Also, the app should have a widget to show the case and earbuds battery lives without going into the app."

      "I like that I can create my own custom watch face. I have changed the watch to a new Galaxy watch and now my selected custom watchface occasionally is changed to another WatchMaker watchface without any input from me. After feedback to check the shuffle mode is turned off, it took a while to figure out where and how to find this setting. It was off. I resolved the problem by downloading the program from Galaxy Store vs Google. Unfortunately weather data is not accurate. Updates has affected it.",
      "Got this with pro, thinking that I would be safe with a new Fossil Sport using a big watchface app, but I was wrong. After maybe an hour of use the watch becomes unresponsive and is freezing up. This doesn't happen with the built-in watchfaces. update: The developer contacted me and I'm giving the updated app a shot with some experimental fixes (not sure if this requires some action on my part other than installing the app again).",
      "Deeply hindered by rampant ads in the premium version. First, the watchmaker watch face tool is the best tool out there for designing watch faces. It has powerful features, while still being simple enough to be easy. However, the premium key, which is supposed to remove ads, only removes THIRD PARTY ads. EDIT: Dev responded to complaint about ads with copy/pasted text that reads just like another ad (see other reviews with the same verbatim response). I guess that says more than I ever could.",
      "Non stop ads every click!!! Many ads cover the content (reported to Google as it is against the policy).Spent 30 minutes and still could not get anywhere!This is laughably the most horrible app I downloaded. Could not even make it to work due to bad ux and non stop ads.Does not deserve 1 star! What I understood is that this is a DEMO app that is suppose to show the functionality of the paid app only. Yet this is done with ads. Lol stupidity is beyond belief...why try paid if demo doesn't work!?",
      "Won't run since last update. This used to be a great app but now it just locks up whenever started. I tried reinstalling multiple times and it still locks up. I have an LG V30 and the app is totally useless now. I can't even access the watch faces that I had already purchased or saved."

      "Horrible. After updating the app, notifications stopped working. App said \"There was a problem syncing (...)\". So I reinstalled Wear OS, did a factory reset on my watch (Fossil Explorist), paired again and got the same result. Reinstalled and factory reset again, now they won't even pair anymore. Yes, I also looked for help in your forums. No, it did not help. Please fix the app.",
      "I think it's good but it can be allot better. You need Google play music to stream all music directly from watch to a tethered Bluetooth headset and other music streaming services too. Features i should not need to have to download a 3rd party app: 1. Camera remote 2. Calculator 3. Sleep tracking 4. Google maps GPS. The UI should be in Black mode to save battery and more big finger friendly rounded menus. Apps should be standaline with no need to install the phone app instead it should sync.",
      "This has been a lifesaver for me as a teacher. I'm not sure if it's my watch, phone (LG Stylo 4) or the app, but lately, it will not show the correct temp, it constantly says -460°, which I'm pretty sure is not the temperature. Can you advise of any fixes?",
      "Most frustrating. Just bought a Fossil Sport. I see a lot of postings. 1. Google Assistant does not work. Usually receive an error message that something went wrong. 2. Can't set reminders. After you try to add one, the dots just keep spinning. Is someone working on a fix or a work around?",
      "Afrer the latest update, there is a problem syncing the notifications with the watch. Despite thw fact that bluetooth is always on and all the permissions are granted, the app wont work and because of this reason only i have to reboot my device like 10 times a day."

With other app ur app is too money hungry appIfeel there are hardly 10 to 12 free watch face.. Rest all paid thats y stopped using the appAlso ur app makes watch toocreepy to open any thing---",
      "Virtually unlimited faces and even the ability to make your own basic faces even without premium access. Doesn't seem to impact battery life anymore than stock faces, and loading new faces is shockingly snappy.",
      "I really love this app. It's truly easy to use! My favorite part is of course, the watch face designs!! There are so many to choose from!! There is a brief description of the watch design & watch face by the designer. And you can select your favorite styles by clicking on the heart icon that's to the right of the picture, and it will be saved in the watch box section, which is accessible at the very bottom of your right-hand page. It has a watch box looking icon."

      "I just got a Fossil Q Venture. All I was looking for was to add my own personal pictures as my watch face. Which even without the pro version , it works great for just that. But I went ahead and bought the pro version so I could have access to a few more of the customization options, but I love it and I definitely recommend it for someone who's looking for just a simple program to use to customize your watch.",
      "I love it.. very simple to use I just upload my pictures and I can see it on my watch. This is Great i wouldn't use any other app.",
      "I agree with everyone's frustration about the advertisement including features that aren't free. Total waste of time of you weren't expecting to spend money, feels like false advertising. After you spend too much money on it, it's okay. I wish you could save multiple faces. I hardly use the image swap feature for this reason. One watch face and color isn't going to work with every image.",
      "A really nice app. There are some features that doesn't look good on my watch like the battery percentage there should be options on how you want to see it. The way that big battery is on the display doesn't look nice at all. But besides that you did something that many galaxy wear users were hoping to have and is to have their photos on display. That's why I rated with 3 stars."

Discoverable mode\r\nTurn on discoverable mode on your swatch. Let’s say you want to pair your phone with your car’s infotainment system. First, go into your phone’s or iwatch app settings and tap on Bluetooth. Then depress the buttons on your infotainment system, usually on the steering wheel or center stack, to get it looking for the device. Once it finds your phone, the car may ask for a numeric code you need to confirm or input on your phone. After you do so, the devices should be paired.\r\n\r\nProblems with BT pairing\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the devices you are trying to pair are close each to other. Do not try to pair a phone with a keyboard or any not Android/Android Wear bluetooth based devices.\r\n\r\n2.

I think the critical error here is the name. or maybe they're looking to vacuum up some unsuspecting Galaxy watch owners, IDK. do not buy this for a Galaxy watch.",

Why not use the resources through Wear OS? Had to change back to a different face, because I don't want the persistent notification."

But there is a bug maybe or not sure if it's a feature, but if you disable the logo, the time including date and weather will shift up a bit so it's not in the middle anymore. I noticed it immediately and looks bit odd. Maybe a quick hot fix for this? :)",
      "Brilliant watch face using it on a ticwatch pro and looks fantastic. Blends seamlessly with OS layout and feel. Well done to the dev team appreciate your work. Update: thanks for the latest update, is it possible on the next update to allow the thin text on the full display as well as the ambient? Looks much more modern.",
      "Edit March 3, 2020: Looks great and most importantly, long battery life. My last recommendation is a toggle to remove the battery percentage in ambient. Great work!",
      "Excellent vanilla Google face. As pixel as it gets. Good weather accuracy. Must have for wear os especially if you own a pixel of Android one phone.",

      "I was using the WiiWatch2 app, this app is SO MUCH more improved! I went from regretting my purchase of an android watch (android 7.1.1 TicWris Max) to enjoying it as my new daily driver! This makes a huge difference, I even paid for premium to get the full experience. The notifications to the watch from this app are great. Being able to reply to text using voice is an upgrade (like my WearOS watch, but better). All notifications are 100% improved both visually and in actions. I will update this review as time goes on to reflect my current state of affairs as I'm just now getting into full android watches.",
      "Works really well with my kospet prime android watch, the only thing I'd like adding is an option to remove all message notification on the watch rather than 1 by 1, and for some reason when someone calls me the number or contact is not displayed on my watch......it just vibrates and says \"view\" Other than that it works perfectly!!!!",
      "This app seems to work better than the stock app for use with my Kospet Optimus Pro! Thanks so much for making it! I was missing notifications before with the stock app. Now I get everything I want from my phone.",
      "Worked great on my old phone... Not on this one!? On the mi 9t pro, it only works if the entire app runs constantly. As soon as I close it, it no longer sends notifications. But running it all the time destroys my battery life!",
      "Sorry, I am changing to 3 stars, I have tried so many different apps and so far this one is good. After running this app for about 2 weeks I noticed that my watch battery on my Gen 5 was draining to quick. Having your app running all the time on my smart watch was killing my watch battery, I set my watch to always sleep and the app will wake when a message was received. Normally I would get home and still have about 60 to 50 percent of battery life, with the app running all the time I barely got 3 hours. I removed the app and went back to wear os Informer messages for wear os."

      "Great face to use not much load on the battery the only issue I have is how difficult it is to configure and even buying the premium is hard to find. Everything should be from the app as much watch faces do...some add ability for customization would be a nice addition...but I like it",

I'm contemplating moving most of my other apps off my default home screen, giving this app the maximum space there.

(2) Making the clock hands thinner at the end might look good and even more realistic.",

      "Purchased this to replace face on zenwatch 2 with 3 tiles. Needed due to zenwatch manager being removed from play store. It seems to work ok. There are no square options but this one did fill the screen I didn't realize that I would have to upgrade for every face to use tiles. however this one looks ok so I will stick with it.",
      "I love this watchface. It shows everthing I want to see in a very attractive format.",
      "It's too restricted without payment. I get the need for ads and I also get that developers need money to keep working, but don't place a \"free\" version that does almost nothing of what it's shown here. Two stars because you do get the watch face, even though you can not modify it.",
      "i bought the premium version and liked the features that came with the watch face. unfortunately, the app was updating very often to the watch (steps mostly). and over half a day of use, had drained 16% of an lg g6 battery on its own. if there was a way to set the info refresh rate, I'm sure it would help. i uninstalled the app and will be looking for a different watch face (fossil explorist 4 hr)",
      "Seems cool, but it's impossible to change which account on your phone or watch is the one that should be paying for premium, and for me it defaults to the wrong one, so I can't upgrade, and am locked out of features. Huge oversight."

      "Was impressed by the chance for great new widget for phone. The app stopped refreshing time after about a day of use. Wouldn't keep accurate time. Had to uninstall and reload old widget. Looks cool. Adjustable features. Can't rely on. Too bad I paid for this. Also can't access alarm function on phone as widget. Contacted designer and they hopefully can fix.",
      "Edit. Figured how to update correct time. Re add widget. Only complaint otherwise is that I wish the \"digital background color\" part could also have the option to have the same option as the background of watch part.",
      "Weather widget not able to update automatically. I purchased the paid version and tried multiple weather providers, restarted my tic watch pro and phone (oneplus 7t) several times but it doesn't showing the weather unless I update it manually inside the configuration. Solved the problem meanwhile, with providing continuous location access in Android 10+",
      "Best watch face I have found although this does not perform perfectly ON MY Watch. Still getting used to a gift. Watch face is very flexible and meets all my needs and more. I have now had time to get used to the watch and the App. Very impressed with the app by the versatility, customisation ability and design. If you are someone who likes numbers and maximising the use of your smart watch this is the app for me. My watch is using android wear 2 but several years old & limits full utilisation",
      "I like the it keeps you from conforming to the preloaded cookie cutter time pieces that your phome comes with, and you can also customize it aswell, so you don't have to worry about someone elses looting like your."

      "Maybe the VERY best support of any app on the store. The dev is totally devoted to this app and has been continuously updating it since 2014. I actually bought a new watch with version 2.x of wear os to this app would work better (kinda buggy on wear 1.xxx). One downside; while there are tons of tutorials (videos and write-ups) out there there is no ORGANIZED reference document. This app has so many options/feature to configure that it's extremely complex. For example, I have been unable to find any info documenting what the PRIORITY parameter is used for. But I still give this app 5 stars and would give it 10 if I could. Thanks, dev.",

    "title":"Cronosurf Wave watch",
    "description":"Cronosurf Wave is a chronograph watch app for Android devices and a watch face for Wear OS watches.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The Tizen operating system and thus Samsung Gear/Galaxy watches are NOT supported as of today!\r\n\r\nThis app is based on the original design started 2014 as a web-based technology demonstrator (cronosurf.com). Its main focus lays on design, functionality and usability. If you are a chronograph watch lover, you'll find yourself using Cronosurf as your day-to-day app for alarm, countdown timer and stopwatch.\r\n\r\nSince Cronosurf has many features, the app includes a comprehensive user manual. The Button Assistant (also available on the web version) labels each button according to the momentary state of the watch and  helps you to quickly get familiarized with the basics.

      "It's very nice, and functional. If only it had a widget, I'd give it a perfect score. For now, I'm using the LWP and resized the watch face so it looks like a widget. Also, the hour and minute hands seem to blend into the watch face so sometimes it's hard to quickly see the time. Maybe if they were a different color like blue or red or even cyan? Nicer if they were 3D like the seconds hand.The world time would also be nice with multiple presets (like some of the Citizen eco-drive watches).",

      "I think you have ads ,you even say no ads ,so, what's up?",
      "Great watch face, my primary one now. Love it, only wish I could adjust the ambient brightness. It's too bright at night, when it's brighter than level 1 brightness, and it's a bit dim during the day. I know it's a Wear OS issue more than a watch face issue, but it can be worked around."

First, the two whether apps are not very accurate, at least not where I live in Northern Utah. There should be more options to choose from. The other thing is when setting the left option to steps, it does not change; it stays at 0 all the time. I'm sticking with it for a bit, hoping they will make some improvements. This is on TicWatch Pro.",

Haven't figured out      how to display an photo or the moon-phase in one of the 3 tap targets. if anyone has figured it out please let me know.",

      "Excellent watch face alongside functionality on my Fossil Carlyle Gen 5. Love the versatility behind choosing Complications, whether it be thema's or Fossil's. Noticeable mention on Ambient Mode's overall versatility: from choosing what to have shown to the color, to even thema's own timer and stopwatch (depends on which is running). Also, it is one of the few if not the only watch face that allows my watch to go a full days of work and well over midnight with all functions turned on.",
      "I absolutely love this watchface! I use it on the Diesel Axial and it looks amazing. I bought it the first day I got my watch and I haven't used any other watchface for more than a few hours before I switch back to this. Very nice customization options as well. If I ever change watchface it will probably be another from Thema",
      "Good looking, it stops frequently, so mostly people uninstal after some days when they fedup adjusting it after every second day, I am also one of them, today also it has stoped. Can u do some rectification to avoid this problem. If U can do it, it will be well & Good.",
      "Using this watch face on my TicWatch E2. The battery life is way better than with some other watch face apps, and the customization after you purchase premium is great. I highly recommend this one.",
      "Easily customizable! I'm pretty much a novice at this, and it was very easy to use, including color choice, adding shortcuts and widgets, etc. Can't beat it for the low price, too!"

      "Really cool watch face however a battery drain making it unusable",
      "Not happy with the watch. After buying the premium version the time between the Analog and digital clock does not match. For example if the time is 10:15 am in analog it shows 9:15 am in digital clock which cannot be changed. Other than that the watch looks very good.",
      "Very disappointed with the new \"upgrade\". The lcd screen no longer allows a second time zone, isnt used to display step or weather information or even as the stopwatch display (so now you can't see the time and the stopwatch at the same time). Everything is an external screen. New purchases take note as the video still shows the old way, not how the watch face works now. Also can't configure the shortcuts on the watch bezel. This update essentially ruined my favorite watchface.",
      "Hi, actually very pleased with the face design, but, a BIG BUT here, the newest update seems breaks the digital time, it doesnt update the time at all, the digital time stopped at the minute it was set and didn't move to the next minute, I've restarted the watch (im on fossil sport) with no luck, please repair this.",
      "Love this watch face. This is, by far, my favorite watch face. Love all the detail. Love the \"full ambient\" mode. Shows both analog watch hands (good for a quick look) and also shows digital info data. Looks great, fun, useful."

      "Don't waste your money in \"premium\" content. The developer might produce good watch faces but they also delete watch faces you've purchased premium content for without notice or option to transfer. The deleted watch faces stop working or set display to almost zero brightness. Amateurs? Rip-off merchants? Or just idiots with a development SDK?",
      "Was perfect for the ticwatch E. Now that I am using Michael Kors Lexington 2, the weather forcast will not update automatically no matter how long I choose for the interval.",
      "I was very disappointed. It doesn't support my Ticwatch C2 to count steps, including google fit, the app let me allow it to turn on the GPS to count steps, unfortunately when I turned the GPS on, this function still doesn't work well.",
      "Lags a ton, and the free \"core\" options only consists of changing the background colour and changing the notifications count from a dot to a numerical value. Free version is so limited, you can't even change the complications on the watch face itself (e.g. change the \"Weather\" function to something of your own choice). Due to the VERY limited experience on the free version, I am hesitant to purchase the premium version, since I can hardly judge the versatility of this watch face based on what I experienced with the free version. I understand watch face makers want to make money off premium versions of their watch faces (and I did purchase premium versions of watch faces I like), but this free version does not give me enough justification to purchase the premium version. To be fair though, visuals are sleek and the concept looks nice on paper."

All in all good face and even better with the pro option.",
      "Lots of color variation. Very cool. Customizable widgets, launchers and app support.",
      "So far my favorite day-to-day Wear OS watchface! it has a lot of information and room for complications without looking cluttered. The time is large and easy to see at a glance. It looks \"techy\" without being cheesy too, and all the round elements accentuate the round faces on the vast majority of today's Wear watches, and looks nice on my Ticwatch S2. I also like all the color combination choices. just wish I could custom name the shortcuts, the way they cut off doesnt look good sometimes.",
      "Cool customizable color schemes-very easy to see time-shortcuts are custom too and very handy. Has all the typically useful functions without being too busy looking. Def worth it to get the premium version but the free one didn't suck either",
      "First off... I installed this one because I liked the look of it but there are plenty more to choose from in the play store from this dev, all look good to me and this one looks even better on the my Ticwatch Pro. Originally I had a few issues and emailed the dev but it was all sorted very quickly, Thomas is a very approachable dev. For a standalone watch face this is a very well finished app with all wear OS complications and a multitude of colour options. Well worth the pennies for premium👍"

      "The best smart watch face app, PERIOD. Elegant, cool, customizable. Buy the premium. For a couple of dollars this app won't disappoint. There are lots of other watch face apps that are cluncky and cost much more. The only complaint is that this app isn't available on all platforms (iOS, Tizen, Google Wear, Fitbit). Obviously that's not easy to develop, but we'd all benefit from this app.",
      "Just love the face created. I love that for a minimal amount, I have access to many faces. Thanks so much for the amazing app",
      "I used the free version for a while and liked it, so bought the premium version. Unfortunately the sync between the phone and watch stopped working for some reason. I was not able to make any changes to the watch face even though the changes are saved under settings, the watch stayed on the default screen. I communicated with the developer and I have to admit, his response was quick and he even solved the issue within a day by releasing a update specific to my watch face. Excellent service.",
      "Great features, but widgets are too small & don't change size when using fewer of them. Can't customize widget colors, either.",
      "Installed the app yesterday, and within a half hour, had it perfectly customized to my liking.  Love the layout and the TONS of customization options..  Had a small issue trying to get a complication working correctly.  Sent the developer a message, and within a few minutes, had an answer to my issue; simple fix.  My favorite option is the ability to set the screen on-time.  Highly recommend the premium version of this this watch face (great value at $1.19), and will be looking at others from this developer!    FYI... There is a great review/how-to video of this watch face on Youtube on Jabber Tech.  Very in-depth explanation of the setup process and options."

The mix of analog and digital elements is wonderful, and the sheer amount of information on display (and how readily I can customize it) is simply wonderful. 10/10, probably grabbing Rapier next.",
      "I like watch faces that remain active for longer than 5 seconds, this has options of remaining active for up to 30 seconds, it has various colour combinations and lots of configurable interactive apps. A regularly used watch face on my Huawei Watch 2. Keep up the good work.",

      "Another brilliant Wear OS app from this developer. Have made a donation as fully deserved. Dev, if you're reading this by any chance, I don't suppose you could let me know if you think you'll be able to see about a persistent notification for the Phone/Watch battery app? Many thanks!",
      "Worked perfectly! Remote install took a few minutes, so be patient with that. Once it was installed, I found my list watch within seconds. It had been missing since this morning, and four people were looking/keeping an eye out for it. TEN HOURS LATER i installed this app, and found my watch right away!",
      "This app is lit!!! So I just realize I forgot my smart watch at work yesterday. I know I forgot it there but when I called my coworkers say they didnt see anything. so i looked for a smartwatch tracker and I found this! i've heard one of my co workers voice by using audio. Call them back and make my watch vibrate and alarm and viola they saw my watch!!! amazing app 😍",
      "Does what it says, and well. I installed it on my lost watch (connected but couldn't find it) then chose the find by mic option. Then I stomped around until I could hear my stomping via the watch, headed towards the direction I could tell I was getting louder, then eventually found my watch down in the cushions of the couch! So, thank you!",
      "I'm giving the app 5 stars because it does what it's set out to do by helping people find their lost watch. I lost mine, but was able to download the app remotely from my phone onto my lost watch. You could use 2 features: find by vibrating and flashing or find by using the microphone. the vibrating and flashing was super effective. Didn't realize how hard my watch could vibrate. My only recommendation would be to change the damn font. nothing says sketchy like the font that you guys used."

The watchface also has a scale that displays your battery life and a crescent that shows the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event that the watch does not automatically notify you to set up Radii you can manually do so by following these steps: \r\n• On the watch, press the side button and go to Play Store\r\n• Scroll down until the section \"Apps on your phone\" appears. You should be able to see Radii listed under this section.\r\n• Under Radii, tap on \"Install\".

      "Hey guys, you've done a great job with this watch face!! I love the simplicity of it. This is all I use now. I have just one recommendation/request. Could you add the ability to change the brightness of the Ambient Display? I've noticed it's set to full (or very high) brightness and it may be an unnecessary drain to the battery. Thanks so much. Great job!!!",
      "Very well done, good design. Used it exclusively on 2 different watches",
      "Extrememy clean and minimal seen a lot of people complaining that they couldnt apply the watch face to their watch. its a standalone app. install it on your phone and wait a few mins. Then press the \"resync apps\" button on the wear OS app. it will appear with a notification on your watch saying the app is installed, and there you have it...",
      "After trial and error I decided go online and figure out how to add the watch face to my Fossil Explorer 3. I didn't realize this watch face is a standalone app. What i found worked perfect! -If the screen is dim, press the power button to wake up your watch. -To see your list of apps, press the power button. -Scroll down and tap Play Store . ... -Scroll down and look for the \"Apps on your phone\" section. -To download the app, tap Install . I can now contol the watch face from my phone app!",
      "Top marks on the design. Easily the best watch face I've seen and absolutely love it. If the developer is reading this. Although this is a great design is there any chance you could add in steps/heart rate and show the battery level in the AOD mode? With this I'd definitely not need another watch face again. Thanks again for the great work 👍"

A couple things could be better: You get a choice of a few backgrounds, and most of them are so dark you can't add much color to them. And no way to use your own backgrounds. The color pallet is a limited dot selector. No custom colors",
      "Great face for Fossil Gen 5. I can finally have all of the shortcuts that I need on the watch face. I have 4 shortcuts and 5 widgets....a lot but the face is still cool looking. The app is super easy and intuitive.",
      "This is a FIRST CLASS app and developer! There are a MULTITUDE of different preferences to choose from, and I am able to create and save exactly the watch face I wanted. I have a Fossil 5th Gen smartwatch, and it looks very sharp with these faces, and functionality. I initially had a question about the interactive buttons, but I e-mailed the developer, and he personally responded to me within a few hours, (on a SUNDAY!). Get the PREMIUM from the start ... it's WELL worth a small \"donation \"!",
      "This is easily one of the best looking watch faces in the app store! I really like the looks and the layout of this watch face with the exception of one small thing. The battery level for the phone and watch should be just another widget. I'd like to have these two small windows/ circles open for something extra like sunrise on the left and sunset on the right. or some other complication.",
      "love the customization available. feom the widgets to apps that can display on the face. only ever had one issue and that was with the messages app(pixel 3). when i recieved a notification a \"1\" would appear indicating an unread text but would go away after reading the text. other than that, amazing and thats why im writing this."

      "Firstly the seconds hand is missing on the widget. In settings it looks like there is an on off for it but it does nothing. Settings is also wacked....changing txt color for seconds changes day colors. Settings makes no sense. There should be a graphic in settings that shows what you are attempting to customize. Terrible app....already requested refund from google. Paying for premium is a bad deal. Update: Developer responded with no help at all but simply a snide remark. So they decided to remove \"seconds\" with an update. Note, I am talking about the second hand not seconds, which still display. App may look nice but is pure JUNK.",

      "My 1st downloaded watch face app on my TicW E2. I paid $2.79 for a full version. Love the analog looks with all its useful complications options/areas. Some observations: (a) top shortcuts icons are too small to see or accurately tap on; (b) phone app has an UI layout, where the settings contents seem categorically unorganized; (c) watch battery lasts about 12hrs (while other similarly complications-loaded watch faces last 14-15hrs).",
      "I never thought I'd be willing to pay for a watch face app, but this one feels well worth it. It looks great, but above all I love how many apps you can assign to shortcuts. It also has some great built-in functions like a phone finder and flashlight switch.",
      "Excellent. Has every function needed including hourly chirp and disconnection buzz which I've never found on any other app. All functions are available from the watch face and can be set to suit your requirements. This app has everything. Actually one star off for the date. Top or middle its impossible to read. It's needs to be available as a number only positioned centre right. Or available in one of the function positions.",
      "This watch face can be customized extensively. Most features can be managed from your phone. By being able to disable certain display items for always on, the battery lasts much better when using always on. Really works well.",
      "Guys what happenned to real.weather reborn??? It was the only watch face i honestly liked i even payed money to unlock the features it.worked.great until recently when the the weather said it.was.mi us 460 degrees and my step count was way off so i took ot off and tried to reload it but it wouldnt reload then i started lookong everywhere for.it nowhere so now what? I got.screwed?? I mean i PAYED for that and now its wiped off the the best face you had in my opinion is now gone anreally that sux"

This is a simple fix, and yet I've never seen a sinhle update since downloading to fix such an issue. Put this into 1 star because I do not believe the chrono24 developers are putting anymore effort towards the app.",
      "I was excited to use this app to track the value of my collection, but it has been more of a struggle than it's worth. I can find watches I own that are posted for sale, but \"can't be found\" when trying to add them to my collection. If I can't add my watches on the app, why even have the feature? I've also noticed prices are often listed significantly higher than I can find brand new on other sites. Overall disappointing. Edit: Don't send canned responses to negative feedback. Fix your app.",
      "New update made more in-app changes. However, the Add to Notepad (❤️) is broken and always shows 0 (while the web version is working). Also, there's still some pages referred back to the Web.",
      "Cool app. Great source to compare prices. I would like to be able to copy and paste. Example: copy product number and search for it. You can't do that. I will not submit feedback to another website.",

      "Love the concept and I made a really cool watch face with it. However, if you have a Samsung Galaxy watch, it does not connect to Samsung Health and the application functionality is extremely inaccurate. This includes Steps, Heart Rate, Weather and distance. I spent the money on the Premium application and the Samsung Companion application. You don't find out until you have a bunch of time invested that it is not going to work. Please don't respond with the forum websites, been there, done that and it still doesn't work. Resetting the watch and the phone only to get erroneous information does not seem very efficient to me.",
      "App doesn't work all of a sudden. I had it installed on my LG G8x and it worked perfectly fine until a few months ago. It told me I didn't have the premium version when I did. I contacted the creators and received no answer. So I'm giving up after this last attempt. I'll be requesting a refund.",
      "I paid the $7.99 for Premium. Yesterday I was able to add watch faces to my watch. Today they all say can't connect with watch. I have Bluetooth on the phone & watch. I uninstalled watchmaker and reinstalled. It didn't ask to re-pair it, but says it's activated. I have a watchmaker watch face showing and it will not send the new watch faces to the Fossil Gen 5 watch.",
      "Don't bother paying for premium, they say it's \"ad free\" but it's not, you still get pop up ads and you also get ads uploaded directly to your camera gallery. Aside from the annoying and invasive ads the app works decently although their animated watch faces are lacking in diversity and functionality (many animated faces freeze or crash within minutes of use). Bottom line, don't spend your money on this, use the free service as is because there isn't any behavior difference between them.",
      "Great app for making your own watch faces, and has lots of pre-made choices available. The only issue I have run into is that the weather info does not update reliably. Even setting a tap action to update it does not cause an actual update, it just changes the \"last updated\" time."

That there might be problem in the battery but the problem was with the application of samsung watch in a day it consume around 30-35 % of battery and this reason I need to charge my phone 3 a day which is not a good sign please do needful and resolve the issue as we hope samsung products are the best and provide best services to there costomers that's why we using the watch of samsung",
      "THIS IS COMPLETELY DRAINING MY BATTERY! I have a one plus 6 and because of this app, I literally have to charge my phone 2-3x a day. The battery is a major issue & makes this watch unusable. It needs to be fixed asap so that one can wear the watch without draining the battery. Would have given 0 stars if that was an option. Didn't pay so much for a gadget that drains my battery.",
      "Everyone was complaining about the battery issue, so I tested it with my OnePlus 6, and with no surprise the results are same. 25% - 30% battery is draining in a day. Every two to three hours i am getting notification of battery draining so fast due to this plugin. I thought this issue would be resolved in Jan'20 update, but it is still there. Hope you guys work on it.",
      "Hi there, I would have raised my rating, but I am my facing the connectivity issue with the watch, and also I have reported the issue but have not received any update to it. Issue I am facing: the watch gets disconnected several times a day, I need to open the app, Connect the watch again and within few minutes it gets disconnected again. Please look into this ASAP.",
      "I think the battery draining problem is only for the oneplus 6. The battery of both oneplus 6 and the watch drains so fast that it won't even last for 12hrs more like 6 hr hardly... I think this problem came from the second last update from oneplus and form Samsung galaxy watch. I though that this thing is only with me but as i read the more comments, almost all of the problem is from oneplus 6 only. So plz fix the bugs."

Looks great on a Sony Smart Watch 3, making good use of the screen shape and available space. Only suggestion - and this is really nit-picking! - is for the time and date to be moved down the screen a little, to prove a bit more of a gap between them and the other info (battery charge symbol, battery charge value, and seconds). Great app. Love it!",

      "I was excited to try this app and have a beautiful animated watch face, but the app never launches properly, despite the necessary updates that I had to install immediately after installing the app! I couldn't even preview any of the animations, nor would it allow me to make a selection. Very disappointing. I have never given a 1 star rating until now.",

      "Looks good. Steps are broken, keeps showing 0. Here would be my suggestions / wishlist: app shortcuts should allow to chose any installed watch app / 'White markers' color should be customizable for ambient and interactive / 'White markers' should have a separate disable switch for full ambient / when 'White markers' is disabled, watch size should increase to fill up screen / Premium should allow to hide fit steps (like free version) / Interactive 'actions' should be customizable",
      "I enjoy all the features of this watch face, except that no matter what I do the Google Fit Steps do not sync with the face. Also, I would love to see Messages as quick app. How can I get this to work so I can actually use what I paid for?",
      "Really cool, my only wish is that Spotify can be added to the app shortcuts, and that connectivity icons can be hidden (like the cloud when you aren't connected to the internet)"

It usually dies 3 to 4 hours before I normally take it off.",
      "Beautiful watch face and very generous free offering by the developer actually. Was tempted to get the premium but would not because of two things. Actually sort of a deal breaker. 1. Although the watchface is gorgeous, it needs a better ambient mode, the currently tiny text is not particularly useful of stylish. It makes it feel like the display is smaller than it is, maybe a circle around the edges etc could help emphasize the size of the display and 2. Google fit data wouldn't show up.",

Hopefully you'll address this with updates. Thanks again!!",

Really great app and watch face.",

      "Does not even work from the start. Can't set anything, keeps me in the loop between this app and Google play store. Watch faces look usable but app is horrible. Reinstalled the app twice. Tic watch pro 4g",
      "I installed this watch face on my Misfit Vapor and it works wonderfully. It is one of my favorite watch faces. I love its design, looks and functionality! I am able to use my external complication from xDrip to display my blood sugar values. Thank you!",
      "Update! This is awesome customer service! Updated release brings back the functionality I missed. Kudos to the developer for doing this. Would be nice to have more control over the colors of the numbers on the dial. Is this, too, a Google limitation? Old release -- Yet another user not happy with latest update. Why, why, why, must coders insist on fixing what is not broken. Where is the premium option? Where is the phone battery status?",
      "Rating would have been 4 stars, however, update said fixes crash but also took away functionality - specifically phone charge meter, tap to change color, weather says 0 degF and sunny, but it is 48 degF and dark out (10 PM). It took some time to find the face I liked. I've had it since I got the watch 3 years ago. Time to look for another one.",
      "Loving this watch face app on my new Fossil Sport with Wear OS.  Has more than I imagined I could get on a great looking screen.    I'm all in on Google Services so I especially like the shortcuts and colored icons which remind me of Google colors.    Maps and Keep were not working but then I guessed that those apps needed to be installed on the watch.  Sure enough after installing everything is working great.  Cannot believe I can actually create a note and reminder right on the watch.    Really great app, can't say enough about it and well worth the cost.  J"

      "Out of the many apps here I chose this one because I like the look and features. But, the main reason i want one aside from the clock is for the step counter and I have not been able to get it to work. Even after trying the instruction. If I could get that working I would consider 4 stars.",
      "The free version limits many of the features so you may find it difficult to get a feel for how good this watch face really is. The upgrade to premium is a voluntary value and the developer has mentioned in other replies that any value unlocks all features. The widget and display customization has enough options to impress and is well worth the financial support. This is my second watch face from Thema and I'm pleased with the app and the quick response from the developer.",
      "02/26 - Very unique style watchface.. functional and accurate. I only have Thema watchfaces on my watch. :)",
      "App/watch face is good; hex is not really my forte. Developer has other great watch faces, I went premium on a few of my favorites. Of course nearly all watch face apps have a free and 'paid' version. You don't want to pay... Don't. Move on, but don't bash the developer for doing the standard thing.",
      "A+++ everything it says and so much more just enough important info even tho just 1 spot more would be perfect lol but great face easy app worth the donation use everyday along with his other faces great developer"

      "Only just downloaded. Loved the free version so got the full version. So far it's pretty good. I have a couple of other watch faces where I can open and read emails and texts directly from the watchface. This doesn't seem to work but I guess it's not a big issue. So far so good.",
      "It's good , but few issues need to rectify 1. Font of second time zone is very small , it is very difficult to read it , so FONT TYPE and SIZE of second time zone and DATE should be adjustable. Since we are getting analog watch display, so there should be an option to remove digital watch, it will also give space to increase font size of second time zone. 3. If possible please add hourly stats of weather forecast for at least next 3 to 4 hours in place of logo X-FORCE.",

      "Nice looking watchface. Unfortunately it does not support tapping the weather complication to get forecast information when using the Chronus weather complication, which is a deal breaker for me. Also, if you're going to get the premium features, make the purchase on your phone as paying for it through my watch caused the phone app to not acknowledge the purchase."

As for the free version, well, it's lovely, except I can't use a watch face without the complications features, which I cannot have, because I cannot purchase the premium face.",

      "Love this face BUT I wish the \"mesh\" by the battery indicator was coloured to reflect power condition and brighten it up at bit - say Green from 100-50%, yellow 49-15% and red down to zero. Would make it that little more interesting to look at.",
      "Simple, straightforward, and easy to read.",
      "First Wear OS watch, and being a heli pilot, this one really appealed to me in terms of looks, functionality, and customization. I can't see it getting anything but better as the dev's respond to the inputs they receive. To be honest, I hit buy and it was listed as $1.53, but I saw the get it free promotion and did that. The next one I get I will gladly pay for to assist this team, it is well deserved! I appreciate the freebie, thank you!"

      "Easily my favourite watch face. I immediately purchased the premium edition. Highly configurable, but also not overly complex. Plenty of options and it looks exactly how a smart watch face ought to look. Although, I did have to purchase it twice as the Google store didn't sync it properly :(. Worth it. Developer deserves it.",
      "Pretty sick watch face. Backgrounds are dope. The different scratched worn looks are exactly the font I want. The different angle options are genius.",
      "Looks ok but would be nice to have a background transparency settings and an option to use your own image as background",
      "One of the best watch faces I've had so far. My only issue was that the step counter does not update (sync with google fit step counter) unless I select another watch face and go back to this one through my watch. Sometimes it does update, but doesn't happen that often. I'm using the Fossil Q Explorist HR Gen 4. Please help with this issue since the Face is perfect and I really want to keep using this as my daily driver. The Step counter is really important for me. Thanks!",
      "It's really awsome to be able to change the face on my watch! It will never be boring to see the same color on my watch! Love it!"

      "My fave watch face to date, goes well with my LG GWatch R with custom strap the whole thing looks neat and tidy, the watch face suits the device well.  A few things to note, it would be nice if, when using the Hide Watch/Mobile Battery options if we could then reuse the circular area now not in use for something else rather than that area remain blank.  Buying premium was well worth it, but I am somewhat annoyed the watch keeps throwing adverts for new watch faces at me now and then without a toggle, believe me if i want a new watch face i will be going straight to this dev to check for more, but throwing up ads ends up being a constant irritant.  The weather side of things is nice and simple but i noticed the watch face does indeed use my preference of Celsius, but when clicking the widget which brings up the full weather section, this part shows Fahrenheit instead of Celsius for the day/weekly view.  Beyond those little niggles, its a great watch face for every day use.",
      "I really enjoy the customization options of this watch face. Having gotten into wear OS with a low end smartwatch (original ticwatch E), I'm leaning towards getting something with a bit more processing power as my current watch tends to lag at times. Unfortunately, all wear OS watches seem to suffer from this and I will likely get a Samsung watch as their processors are much faster. Do you make watchfaces for Tizen? If not would you ever? Nice, customizable watchfaces are so hard to find.",
      "Best watch faces available lots of features and totally worth paying for the full versions.",
      "This watch face is perfect but only with the premium access, which is inexpensive (€1). I highly recommend it, there are tons of customisations and it's smooth which quite a few of other watch faces aren't. One thing that put me off initially was the watermark/brandname, I didn't like it being there but I was willing to put up with it, however even that is customisable and can be toggled off with premium.",
      "fabu-loving this watchface, been looking for one this clean and functional for a while l love this one so much I've paid again, the dude deserves it. but if it breaks, I have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. skills  that make me a nightmare for people like you."

      "So far so good. Like how you can really customize the watch face with ease.",
      "This watchface is practical, but also very beautiful. The choices of colors and backgrounds are numerous, you could easily change the face to go with a different outfit easy day. OR, you could find the most beautiful combination of color and texture and never change. I love the elements that are customizable. 4 widgets display on the watchface continuously and 4 shortcuts you choose to be handy, like flashlight. Now my default watchface!! Missing \"next appointment\". That's worth another star.",
      "Love it. But I've purchased premium it's says I have premium on my phone and all options which is great, but in my watch it says obtain premium to access the extra settings even though I own it and have all the extra in my watch Thanks for reply Deb but I have tried everything premium will not transfer to watch. I have all the options working but I can only make premium changes in the phone which is no good."

      "Did I just buy this !!! Can barely see the hands. No contrast. Today is Sunday, July 9 , looks like on the left side it reads Dec. On right side of face it reads Sun. No date that I can see. Then again , I can hardly see what any of it actually reads. So far I have found no way to set or customize or change any of the dials. The best thing about this watch face is the pictures on the install page. They look Awesome. But as an actual useful watch face , IT SUX",
      "I'd like this app better if it had customizable dials. I mean, If i don't know what month it is,  I'm in trouble. I'd much rather have the date or weather like the better apps. Still, it looks nice and the colors are nice and bright. This app is like a Ferrari, beautiful but totally impractical.",
      "Bought a couple watch faces, now it won't push them to my watch at all. I have tried restarting, and uninstalling all of them. Nothing is working. Junk app.",
      "Good looking watch face, though the hands lack contrast and are therefore hard to locate.   It didn't appear for me in Android Wear on the phone or in the watch (LG Watch R with Wear 2.0), even after uninstall/reinstall and waiting, until I used Play Store on the watch to install it from the list of apps installed on the phone."

      "Works great for me, no complaints. I would however suggest letting us add a note to the time measurements so we can note whether a measurement was made after resting a watch and what position it was in or if it was being worn. But other than that good app.",
      "Enjoying the application, it's a great place to keep track of my watches, and their accuracy. It would be nice to have the ability to configure your own NTP server(s) as well as just choosing from the popular list. Moonphase would be a great addition, too for setting watches with that complication.",
      "It does just what it says. Has Atomic clock. Shows second hand making it easier to set a watch by. Also you can hit a button when your watch is on a particular time and it calculates the difference between atomic clock and your watch to gage accuracy. Lots of different options for paid version depending on what you want to use as far as options. Perhaps a bit price for an app, but it is refreshing to have an app that does not have adds.",
      "Very clear and useful interface make this a superb tool for monitoring your mechanical watches. The time pip had become less useful to me since my African Grey Parrot has learned to repeat this sound continuously all day. The developer was also prompt in replying to a problem I encountered. All-in-all, a great app if you don't have parrots."

      "This is one of the first faces I found for my Ticwatch S2 when I got it. I've tried so many others but keep coming back to this as my everyday watchface. It has all the info and shortcuts I need and it looks so good. The little digital clock is really easy to see in direct sun even at medium brightness. I don't know how many know this also but if on the off change one of the analog hands covers a complication, just tap the center and they disappear. Tap again to turn them back on. Great feature!",
      "I love this app, it has so many different features, color combinations and backgrounds. It looks so nice that I got rid of the complications just to look at the backgrounds. The contrast between the watch background and the digital time zone is what got me to buy this. Awesome job dev!",
      "Excellent watchface with many choices to allow for customization. Also, I had a question, emailed developer, got a very quick, helpful response. Very happy with my watchface purchase decision. (Ticwatch Pro)",
      "Beautiful watch. Loads on it but would it be possible to have the option to make the date and watch battery bigger. My eyesight is not what it used to be haha. Thanks",
      "I paid for the premium but it only works on the phone portion. In order for me to use the premium settings on the phone it wants me to purchase it again. Sneaky"

I tried using other watch faces but I really missed this one. Thomas is a great guy and was very patient with helping me. Cannot recommend this enough!",
      "I'd give it 5 stars if the widgets were just a little bigger. Not big enough to get in the way of the cool animation, but they are a bit of a challenge to read",
      "Neat face, but you have to \"buy a gift\" for the dev/repurchase if you upgrade your phone, factory reset your phone or watch, etc. Some of the other watch faces from this dev will carry over purchases (only 1 of the 3 I purchased carried over to my new phone), but not this one.",
      "love this watch face when it works properly. i dont know if its my phone or the watch but it doesnt vount your steps most of the time. i checked and havd everything that i need for the pedometer portion but the rest of the watch face works perfectly",
      "great watch face, love all the customizations. really the only thing I'd like it a randomized color mode or a color shift mode that alternates through a pallet! great work!"
