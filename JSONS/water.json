      "It is amazing, and super challenging, but now I can't play any further because I unlocked all traits to unlock the gate to get to the beach, that didn't work, so then I tried to buy it, but it's still not letting me, so I tried to restart my phone, and I come back, and it still doesn't work, Can you guys please fix this somehow?",
      "The reason I give this game a 1 star rating is the fact that I can't exit the sewer section because the upside down challenge of each level crashes the app. I cannot gain enough ducks to brake the barrier open because of this bug. Also the level reset button also crashes the app. I had the game for a long time and decided to reinstall it on my new phone. I tried to uninstall and reinstall it but the same bug was still there. Fix it or I removing the game",
      "Fix the gameplay. It is so hard to dig at a specific way without messing everything up and it is very annoying. The dirt next to the slidable blocks are also very hard to dig as it keeps thinking your adjusting the blocks. That becomes problematic in duck rush levels (especially steam). You have to watch 3 ads just to get to the next section, and some levels get very frustrating. Might be a bug, but I cannot access the cutscenes later on and don't even have music after the beach levels",
      "The lock gate requires pay or watch three ads. Watched one ad, then had to wait 24hrs to come back. Then, would not let me play the second ad. Not sure why disney is ripping folks off...oh wait, it's disney. Be honest, if you want us to pay don't lie to us with a bait and switch.",
      "The game crashes again and again. If any challenge level is going on it comes to a certain point and then the game crashes. Fix the problem... otherwise the game is good."

My health has improved 100% now that I drink the recommended amount of water 👍",

It makes a huge impact when you are looking at what you are putting in tour body. A huge bonus is the reminder sound. Super funny. I am using the free version as of right now and I am finding that it runs very smoothly and not so many ads. If all continues well, I will be purchasing the pro version and will update my review then. Big shout out to the developers!!",

      "Loved it. Simple and effective way to keep a track of water intake, against the recommended intake based on body weight..",

      "Love it . Love the UI . Its clean and minimal . The monochrome color option its well pleasing to the eye . Most importantly love the function on tap to fill the meter . It got me addicted to complete my daily water consumption. During this corona outbreak . Its really help me to focus on drinking more water . Thanks ! And keep up the good job !",
      "It's a great app with no disturbing ads that make you wait 30 seconds just to log in a cup of water you just drank... It also let's you select the size of the cup and then edit the time or how much you drank later on in case you want to log 3 cups at once. The only issue I have with it is that the notifications sometimes are missed when you swipe them away too many times in a row. Personally I would also like to be able to select a theme or customise the app a little more, otherwise it's great!!",
      "Would be great if it adjusts the time automatically when we drink water before or after the scheduled time. Eg: you drank water at 11AM and you recorded it, but the actual time scheduled is for 11:30 AM and the app reminds you at 11:30 AM even though you drank water just 30 minutes back. The app could instead reschedule the time for.. let's say, 12:30 or 12:45 maybe. Just a suggestion 😊",
      "I like this app; it is a simple and helpful way to keep track of water intake and daily goals. However, I have a few suggestions which would make it fantastic: 1. a widget to click on when you drink water. 2. when you click on the notification cup, to have an option for it to record the water intake without it opening the app. 3. Please give the option to remove the schedule optimizer. I would prefer to keep the reminders at the times I specify, instead of it changing. Otherwise great app!",
      "This app is really simple, intuitive and has a friendly interface, I like the little tips about how to drink water appropriately. However, I have a slight suggestion for the developer, you can try and reduce the size of the water drop Icon a bit, and space things out slightly, add a bit more space between the tip, the counter and the reminder sections to reduce visual cluttering, and so, reduce confusion to the eyes and make it feel even more intuitive."

      "It is refreshing (pun intended) to return to this app years after I first downloaded it (2014 or 2015). However, while the graphics are immensely better, they cause lots of lag and slow down my phone; I'd love if I can disable the animations. Also, I miss the greater number of cup sizes (now there are only 4, albeit customizable). Still, the plants are cuter than ever. The advertisements are not too invasive. It still serves as a nice reminder to stay hydrated. It does its job beautifully! ❤🌱",
      "I love how the app sends push notifications and encouraged me to drink the water throughout the day. The plants are really cute and motivate me to drink water because i don't want them to dry up.",
      "I struggle drinking enough water so I was looking for an app to help me. I originally thought of something simple like a regular reminder/alarm (similar to what I have seen a few times in Twitch chats). Then I found this app! It's more than I wanted (literally)! I want to drink to keep my plants happy. The plants are very adorable, too! Love the art and the small bits of information. Simple but fun! You can also enjoy it without any microtransactions which is a huge bonus for a mobile app.",
      "The original was better, quicker and easier to use, and felt more customizable with regards to pots and plant names",
      "Plant Nanny is a beautifully stylistic water intake tracking app with charm found nowhere else. It is actively updated with new plants and other implements that continuously grow the game aspect and keep you using the app. I believe it would benefit to be able to view all your individual plants, most likely sorted by what plant they are. You are able to give a plant their own special name and pot but once they're in the greenhouse it becomes hard to track them even when you photograph them."

      "I've always have struggled with drinking enough water, but this app really helped me get into better habits. Totally recommend!",
      "the app is really great. I really loved the design and cute illustrations. The achievement badge is a great idea too. I think it just needs some improvement in terms of user experience. To record water drinking, i have to click 3 buttons whereas in other apps i can do it in one. I think they can also improve more in displaying statistics. Maybe showing the streak in a week could be nice aside from the bar graphs. But overall i think this app has a lot of potential."

The only problem is that I can't seem to add the quantity without logging in to my phone or the app, I see the options like 500/250ml but when I click on it, doesnt add it to the tracker, I think it is supposed to otherwise I dont see why the buttons would be there but unless Im already logged into my phone and tap on it, it then opens up the app and updates the quantity. It would be great if I could keep adding w/o logging in.",

      "This app is perfectly simple to track your water intake without all the bells and whistles. Exactly what I was looking for! Ads are at the bottom and don't pop up on you. You can adjust goals for what you should be drinking, based on weight, or a set an amount to work up to. You can turn reminders on and off, and add earlier intake if you forgot to log it in. And the changing emoji faces based on your progress makes it fun!",
      "I never thought I would be getting an app to track my water intake. I was going to make an excel sheet and then tried tracking it as part of fat secret's food tracker. But it was too cumbersome and I wanted to make it into a competition with myself. You can set alarms if you need assistance reminding yourself to drink up. I don't care about the alarms right now, but I like tracking how many days I smashed my goals. 😁 It's simple and effective so I can focus on other priorities.",
      "Simple, straightforward, does what it's meant to do. Easy to use. Only complaint is that the Streak doesn't update when you put in an entry for a previous day. Several times I've forgotten to put in my last water input of the day until the following morning.. The Intake Chart updates, but the Streak does not. Would be nice if that was fixed, just for the motivational boost. :)",
      "This is a good app the only thing I wish that it had would be half measurements for the amount. And more time selection for reminders would be helpful. I think two hours is too soon for as much as I drink at a time. I think you need to add a two-and-a-half-hour or 3 hour reminder.",
      "I appreciate this app for its simplicity. You don't have to specify a cup size that persists and that you have to select from. You put in the amount of water you drank, and that's all. It tracks it for you, and if you fall behind its recommended pace, the notifications pick up. Other tracking apps try to do far too much and can be so frustrating to work around, especially if you JUST want to track water. This app does exactly what I downloaded it to do and I appreciate that!"

      "Graphics good, play is easy, it doesn't take much skill to play if you're logical minded. However, they only let you go so far before you have to pay to play. Not cool! If I want to pay I'll go buy an Xbox, etc. Gave it a 3 star for the graphics. Still, it buggy. You have to play with it a little, or restart to get it to work out of the bug. Uninstalling!!!",
      "I love the sound of running water. So being able to play a puzzle like this is fun for me. So far the only issue I've had is that the tracking is not the best and you have to try more than once to drop a tile in place. Not a big issue since you are free to move tiles as often as needed. It really is a 3D water puzzle. Unless I missed it somewhere, being able to get a hint about where to place a tile would be nice. Most of us are not going to remember an entire solution in one go.",
      "Great little puzzle game. Many of the puzzles are relatively easy, some (in the basic free version), not so much. Still working on most of the paid add-on sets. Wish they had a build and share your own fountains. Definitely worth 5 stars.",
      "The puzzles aren't that interesting. I don't want super difficulty, but most of the levels here take you longer to move the pieces than to figure out the solution. The way the pieces work and the 3D nature of the levels feels like there's scope for really interesting challenges but I played 100 or so levels and never got to them if they do exist. It's a pity because as an app it's quite nice, the ads aren't terrible, and it loads quickly.",
      "This game has 50 puzzles on each level. There are 6 free levels (with varying difficulty) to choose from. Some levels are unlocked by watching ads. There are 3 advanced levels that require purchase from the store. Graphics are clear and crisp. Seeing the water pass through the maze once the puzzle is complete is extremely satisfying! The controls are pretty straightforward, select and drag. The player has the option to rotate the puzzle to see from all angles. Overall, great puzzle game!"

      "I never write reviews like ever. However this game was such a disappointment I needed to. I used to have this game a while back and I loved it. Now however this game is so horribly ruined by ads it is completely unplayable. The ads are so long that it is actually faster to leave the application close it and re launch it than it is to just watch the ad. Was a great game that is now horrible DO NOT DOWNLOAD! save your self some time. And you can't even buy it once to make it ad free horrible game.",
      "I like it but there's too many Ads.. And when the Ad will open, there is no back button where I can go back to play the game. So annoying. Please don't force people to download the games on the Ad even if we don't like it. Looks like other people will he forcee to download it just so we can go back to the game.",
      "ADS. The game itself is okay, a little ditzy, but the sheer number of ads will test your patience. Ads when you load a level, ads when you complete a level, ads between the \"you win\" screen and the \"next level\" screen, ads when you open the next level, ads when the janky controls lead to you retrying a level... You get the idea.",
      "A great concept for a game but UNPLAYABLE due to the absolutely obscene number of ads. I am not exaggerating when I say there is 30 sec of ads for every 10 sec of gameplay. I get that ad revenue pays for games but no game should have this ratio of gameplay to ads. I am floored by this. Fix you game",
      "There are so many adds after every 2 levels .Just spoil the whole game ; I understand that adds are there but so......many adds . The game is fantastic but due to these 100 of adds just make the game worst game I downloaded 😡😡. Also there are adds when restart the game and to claim prize ."

      "Only my first day using the app but so far I love it. I normally drink a lot of water but never know exactly how much or what is right for my body. I love with a simple 4 question quiz the app told me how much water I should be drinking and how often. I also appreciate the reminder interval you can set because I do get some busy days where I'm constantly on the go and forget to stay hydrated. You can choose from a variety of beverages too. This is all just from the free parts of the app.",
      "Pop up ad after every use, then a pop up explaining why it has to have ads. Jesus, irritating. You're not even a game, you're a damn app for keeping track of fluid intake! And it takes up to 30 seconds for the app to load, a water drinking app with like nothing in it, while my Mahjong game with hundreds of levels loads in literally 1 second. Literally. One second.",
      "I love the fact that this app is totally customizable - you can choose how much water, how often, etc. If you're not sure how much water you're supposed to be drinking, you just answer the perameter questions and it calculates for you, adjusting even for things like exercise and age! Very nice app - I'm glad I chose this over the other ones that I was considering.",
      "Extremely useful app, gave me exactly what I wanted, I could custom the amount of fluid that I drink each time, as well as the total amount of fluid intake through the day. Very nice information about why you need to drink water also keeps changing everyday, and which really does make you feel like drinking water!",
      "Almost every time I enter my water intake it plays a very loud advertisement! Completely unacceptable especially when I'm at work in a quiet office. Ads are fine, videos with sound are not. Cannot use this app anymore until this is changed. UPDATE: I opened the app today after a year of not using it and got blasted with a loud ad featuring Danny DeVito. APP DELETED"

      "Could be great but some things don't make sense. The smallest amount to customize cup size is 200 fl oz? When I click on the reminder it auto logs water intake but I can't edit the amount. The app doesn't divide the calculated daily water amount by the number of reminders set for the day and defaults to 7 oz. which leaves me short. This wouldn't be such a problem if editing options were better. Im sorry I purchased the pro version.",
      "Smooth app. Giving 2 stars until there's a way to delete customized drinking measurements. If there is a way, it's not very intuitive. 5 stars once I get this figured out.",
      "Does it have to be so invasive? Pop up notification cannot be removed whatever you do. I want to be in control of what my phone does. I am into drinking proper amount of water every day, but I hate to be distracted with this pop up every time. Mute notifications will suffice for these purposes. I regret I paid for the app because it's intolerable. Free version had ads with volume so every X minutes you received that madness which was the reason I switched to paid version. Fix your app!",
      "It's o.k. Animation is cute and it's easy to set, but there is no audible reminder. I don't realize the reminder is there unless I look at the phone. I wish it had a tone I can hear to remind me."

      "I equally love and hate the app! It's awesome with reminders and consistent always (even when u dont wanna 🙄 lol) I love the little characters as well as the differnt ways you can keep track of your beverages. I reccomend this app for anyone like myself that really struggles to remeber to drink water daily! I always end up dehydrated and I'd love to see them modify it with a \"sick\" option for colds flus and stomach bugs! As well as even a snack reminder for those of us that are so busy !",
      "I like the app for the tracking options which include coffee, tea, soda, and others in addition to water. I also like being reminded to drink. But I am disappointed that I paid for the ad-free version for life, and yet an ad will still pop up periodically. I hope an update will fix that.",
      "This app has potential to be an intuitive drinking reminder. But I personally found some bugs. (1) I subscribe for one month because I do like the app, but the ads keep appearing. (2) The hamburger menu most of the time won't work after I swipe up from the main screen to see my summary. (3) I installed this app on Galaxy M30s running Android 9.",
      "This is a very good app that helps you to reach your daily water intake goals!! It is simple to use and the reminders throughout the day, keep you on course. Plus the little octupus graphic encourage s you to continue with your goal. Overall, great app that I will be recommending to others.",
      "I really like this app! One reason why is because I have lost 10 pounds 😁 I really really like this app and I'm going to continue this wonderful app. Oh! and also,this app dose notifi you when you need to drink your water.😆😃😁❤️❤️❤️"

Besides that a 100 present good a little anyoing because it will remind you to drink even when you don't feel like it but worth it believe it or not you will lose a lot of weight drinking the water only if you drink the water consistently when it reminds you to you'll have more energy to do the things you need to get done 😘😘😘 love love love it!!",
      "Superb.... Don't go With negative comments..it is the app which have all the features you want.. Except the sound the sound should be more loud or atleast for some more seconds in length so that we can drink water at right time if we forgot in work..because everytime the mobile ohone is not with us... That's why 4 star otherwise a superb app",

      "Not even close to Water Dig from Apple, which I was hoping to find. This has poor graphics and big block graphics which hinder defined pathways needed to play game. Very poor replication!",
      "Not nearly as good of a game as the one for iPhone called Water Rush. I find this game boring and may end up uninstalling. To the android lowers that be, please make a version of the iPhone game. It's far more interesting and engaging than this Water Slippy game 🙄🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭",
      "Wants me to pay second time to remove ads just because I have a new phone.. but will review based off the 200+ levels before this.. it's an alright game that can kill time but after a fairly short amount of time you're really only doing the exact same levels and mechanics over and over",
      "Why. Sometimes I wonder where the old developers of games made apps that didnt have an ad every 5 seconds had gone. I mean, seriously. EVERY GAME NOW HAS SOME SORT OF BANNER AD OR 30 SECOND AD. This is just a RIP off of \"Wheres My Water\" the mobile game probably almost 5 years in age. That game has charm, and was fun. Unlike this one, which is boring, repetitive, and irritating.",
      "Good game although it's clear copy of \"Where's my water\" game. There are things to improve like adding Level Page, fixing a bug where after you disable your internet connection, in order to avoid ads, while you are in game, you get stuck in that level with no next level button. Because game expects ad to finish, but there is no ad without internet connection. Also there are levels that are completely same. Nothing changed."

      "Oh wow! This is so beautiful, and you can feed your fish. You can also choose the size of them and change the backgrounds. Haven't tried the purchase options yet, but going on how much I'm enjoying this so far that's only a matter of time. Superb, off to think of some names for my fishy friends.",
      "This is by far the best live wallpaper app i've ever had!! It is realistic and interactive. I love that it's so customizable, like the fish color, background type, etc. The only glitch is that when you change a fish to big it doesn't wiggle. It just moves around on the screen not moving it's fins or tail. Thanks so much for this awesome wallpaper ❤️",
      "I wanted to rate this a 5.... When I first installed it it was absolutely beautiful! It look like a real koi pond. But ever since the last update- there have been problems. Some of the fish will freeze and only a few of them will move. Just now, when I logged onto my phone, the background had completely frozen. I emailed the developer but haven't heard back. I also bought some of the extras. Please make these changes and I will be more than happy to give this a 5. Thankslo",
      "Play with cute, colorful fish!! Have fun with the little cuties. You can also see the reflection of the world with the trees and the sky!!! Tap the pond and the beautiful pond water will ripple! This app is very entertaining and fun! Have fun playing this cute fishy game, Enjoy! Hope you have fun on this app!!♥️♥️♥️",
      "It is so great it looks so real. But how do i get the keyboard? It said it has one but doesn't or i can't find it. The fish are great looking. The water is the best fake water i have ever seen it looks clear but you can tell it is there i don't know how else to describe it but great. The way the fish swim is so relistic. I love how you can feed the fish and they eat it. You can shake your screen and the water makes waves. You can move the water and also make.it reflect whats round.plusmore."

I am uninstalling the app, I will just be out the 5 dollars. it's not worth the frustration. I will not recommend this to anyone.",
      "This app crashes regularly. It doesn't regularly or accurately sync my friend's water amounts like it's supposed to. The \"add\" friends button doesn't change when you've sent a request, and so you can't tell that the request was sent. This is after both my husband and myself re-installed the app, hoping a reinstall would correct these issues. Notifications (reminders) from the app are not customizable and are not always written in American English (written with English as a second language). This is not an issue culturally, as I embrace cultural diversity. However, at times I've found in programming/apps/software it seems to reflect lack of attention to detail."

It allows me to set my own reminders, edit the amount I want to drink daily, and edit the drink container sizes! I also like that I can change the background 😊 The only even sort of complaint that I have is that I wish the icon for it was different, like a water drop or something.",
      "Absolutely love this app! It's free but it only shows 1 ad a day. The interface is simple and clean and you even have the option to choose from 4 skins. It's super easy to add a record of drinking water too. Only request maybe is to add a widget to add water record so it's easier to record. Great work! 😊 ❤️",
      "Absolutely outstanding. All the other water tracking apps haven't been updated in years and they're pretty boring looking. I only wish this had Android Wear support. Otherwise I can't fault it at all.",
      "Just what I needed A nice unobtrusive app that reminds you with the sound of water pouring. You can set your own schedule, and it does not drown you in ads--only one a day. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",
      "Nice design and easy to use. Has some customisable options, including a dark mode. An extra reminder option, 'No reminder when you're ahead' would be good. So that when we're on track and ahead of the water intake the reminders don't keep showing up. Edit: App quickly incorporated this feature! Thanks Oleg."

I would give 5 stars but the notifications are every 2 hours which I believe is far too long in between each drink (for me) to be able to get in all 2+ltrs per day and there's no option to change it. The notifications are also silent! That is pointless for me if I dont have my phone in my hand at the time. It would be great to have the option to change settings for notofications - some more variations would take this to a 5 star rating. X",

      "I like that it allows you to put in different drinks and if it doesn't list it you can input it. I myself usually only use coffee, water and occasionally milk. I do wish there was a function where you could adjust the timing for the alarm for say every 15 minutes or 30 minutes. Other than that I have no problem with it. It was easy to set up. I use it to track how much I'm drinking each day and another to remind me to take a drink every so often. lol",

      "Simple and practical. App does everything i wanted. Can add water as well as coffee or any other drink.",
      "LOVE the timer notification so I don't get too busy to drink.",
      "Great support. Professional, polite, understand and super responsive. I like how I can select the type of drink. I'm not a big fan of using words like \"hurry\" in push notification messages, but I understand that being able to customize the message might be on the roadmap :) I've tried several drink tracker apps, and this one scored a shared first place."

      "Wonderful, Friendly and easy to use Health & Wellness program, This Encourages, Inspires and Reminds to drink plenty of water, to better care for the body. It has been so helpful and I feel great when I am on track with my goals. This program keeps really detailed and manageable progress",
      "Great app that allows for customization of goals, as well as recommendations. It has helped me get back on track with making sure I drink enough water during the day. My job has me do busy, I have found myself guilty of neglecting this part of my health and self-care. I like that it is simple to use and super easy to learn. I don't mind the ads, so for me, there is no reason to opt for the paid version--the free one works great.",
      "This app has really helped me keep hydraded. I was drinking very little fluids a day. I probably didn't drink much more than 40oz and I was 260lbs. I'm down to 245lbs after about a month or so and I feel so much better. I can think more clearly, I have more energy, and I'm not as hungry as I use to be. At first, I had to urinate constantly, but it's getting to the point where it is not so frequent anymore.",
      "it's quite helpful. Helps keep track of your water intake by the constant reminders that you choose to set.",
      "Had it for less than a minute before popup adds were making it disruptive. I am happy to pay for additional really cool features, not happy about feeling I have to pay for no disruption. Making the user feel like they have to pay to clear the ads is lazy, not creative development. Oh well."

      "I like it. No, I love it! I'd tried another app before this, but this one is much better. It's easier to use and customizes better. I'm drinking more water, between 50-80 oz more each day and lost 5 lbs the first week (with a high protein diet). I recommend this app to anyone who wants to increase their water intake. Don't forget that your kidneys need water to function. 😊👍",
      "It's easy to use, very handy but have problems with the notifications. Have the sound option ticked, yet Android 9 refuses to let me know when the phone screen is off (and the app has been enabled to be awake, no sleep or anything). UPDATE: Was able to solve it, but refuses to accept the alarm sound that I choose, plays the app default sound (ie. water drop). Still this app is a LIFE SAVER. Thank you sooo much for creating it."

Another nice feature would be water amount suggestion adjusted based on weather (for summer/hot days).",

When rotating from vertical to horizontal the icons rotate fine however the wallpaper doesn't rotate correctly making the effects and wallpaper look very distorted. Also on reset the wallpaper resets and you have to select your wallpaper pic again. I do have a Note 10+ so don't know if that's a known issues for newer phones but hope to see a fix.",

An update is long over do. I will change my rating a.d give it the 5* that is deserve after you fix the crashes."

      "Has been a GREAT app!! There is one issue with the \"pick a date\" function. You can't scroll past the current month with it. I'm using android. I like the concept of this function bcuz if the amount of \"days\" you need for your next repot, water, etc is alot it's easier to just use the \"pick a date\" function, but it doesn't work. The arrows for it only allow you to go back 1 month and forward into the current month. Otherwise an absolutely great functioning app.",
      "I think this app is really cool!! I can put in a load of info about my plants and keep journals on them. It also allows you to put in photos so you can see how they grow I guess. It's also really cool how you can put in the watering times ect so it notifies you when to water or fertilise the plants. It's a shame you have to pay to get the full stuff, but people gotta earn money - so five stars! :)",
      "Good! Does not seem to want to save custom pictures. Please add total plant counts or number of plants (total and per label). Hasn't been updated in a while so hopefully it hasn't been abandoned.",
      "Loving the app so far! Very simple and intuitive to use. My only critique is the ability to have different time frame choices for the reminders ( weeks, months, years, etc ). It becomes tedious and a bit annoying when I have to adjust by days for every 2 years on repoting for example. Also, I may want to adjust a reminder instead of removing it and adding a new one. Would give 4.5 if I could. Definitely changing to 5 stars if these features are addressed.",
      "I love this app!! It's pretty intuitive and the notifications work. It's helped me not over water my plants. I did pay 1.99 to get rid of the ads - worth every penny. I want to get the pro version but it's a bit pricey so I haven't yet. But honestly, I've tried all of the other water reminder apps, and this is by far the best one. Edit: I broke down and got the pro version. Absolutely worth it. The graphs provided have changed how I water my plants. Still the best app out there!"

    "description":"*This app is way cooler when paired with your HidrateSpark smart water bottle*\r\nWhy keep track of your water intake manually when your water bottle can do it for you?\r\n\r\nWe all know drinking water is important but millions of us don’t get enough to drink each day, because it’s so easy to forget and hard to track, especially in our busy lives. Hidrate Spark is here to change that and make dehydration a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nHIDRATESPARK SMART WATER BOTTLE GLOWS\r\nHidrateSpark is a smart water bottle that automatically tracks how much water you drink and syncs with this app via bluetooth. This bottle will even glow from within when you need to drink more water.\r\n\r\nHYDRATION HISTORY\r\nSee your hydration progress over time in a daily, weekly, and monthly view. How many days in a row can you reach your goal?\r\n\r\nCUSTOMIZED DAILY GOAL\r\nThe app calculates a recommended hydration goal based on your personal parameters such as age, height, weight and gender. It can even use your location to determine the temperature, humidity and elevation of your surroundings to make sure your goal is customized specifically to you. You can also manually set your goal for health reasons if you’d like.\r\n\r\nINTEGRATE WITH FITNESS AND HEALTH TRACKERS\r\nSync with popular fitness trackers and apps to further customize your goal based on your activity level. Whether you run, bike, swim, lift, do yoga, workout, or simply walk your activity level affects how much water you need to drink.\r\n\r\nNEVER LOSE YOUR BOTTLE\r\nLosing your water bottle sucks, that’s why we made it really hard for this to happen. When location services are turned on the app will know the last place it was paired with your smart water bottle and show you on a map, so you can go back and get it.\r\n\r\nKEEP AN EYE ON YOUR FRIENDS\r\nKeep an eye on your friends progress to make sure they are staying hydrated. Start some friendly competition to see who can get the best streak by meeting their goal the most days in a row.\r\n\r\nFUN NOTIFICATIONS\r\nThe app will also send helpful reminders and notifications when you begin to fall off track and need to drink more water. The bottle will also light up and glow as a fun way to remind you to stay hydrated. Can your friends’ water bottle do that?\r\n\r\n*Drinking water is essential to your bodies health and well being. Check out some of the areas of your life that are affected by hydration.\r\n\r\nCOGNITION & MOOD: Your brain is comprised of 75% water, so proper hydration can have a positive impact on cognitive function and mood.\r\n\r\nATHLETIC PERFORMANCE: Even 1-2% dehydration can decrease physiological performance and 5 % dehydration can decrease your physical performance by 30%. So if you want to win, you better be hydrated.\r\n\r\nHEALTH: Alongside a healthy diet and proper exercise, hydration can help dramatically improve your physical health.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT LOSS: Combined with a  healthy diet and exercise drinking water can increase your metabolism and help you avoid eating and drinking extra calories.\r\n\r\nINCREASED ENERGY: Drinking plenty of water helps with blood circulation thus decreasing your feeling of tiredness and fatigue.\r\n\r\nAVOID HEADACHES: Staying properly hydrated can help avoid headaches.\r\n\r\nHEALTHIER SKIN: Staying properly hydrated helps your skin stay hydrated to help it look younger and healthier.\r\n\r\nBOOST IMMUNITY: Staying properly hydrated can help you fight off illness and infections.\r\n\r\nPREGNANCY: Pregnant and breastfeeding moms need to be properly hydrated so they can support their new baby.\r\n\r\nLearn more about HidrateSpark products and services at www.hidratespark.com",

      "Definitely has gotten me to drink more water. It's a game changer. The app overall feels a little out dated. I wish the battery was rechargable or gave you a better idea when it was about to die. I end up losing a day or two of data when I don't notice. Don't buy Amazon brand batteries, they last 1/3 of the time than the one provided by the company.",
      "It doesn't pair well with an android and I'm really disappointed! It will spend a long time \"searching\" and even when it finally connects it takes a long time to update.",
      "The app is okay, but the hardware in the Spark water bottle isn't great. The lid band broke within a couple of weeks. For awhile I saw frequent (daily or more) Bluetooth disconnects. This lead to a weekly re-sync. Eventually I stopped using it and the battery died. I put in the replacement batteries, and they lasted less than a day. At this point it's kinda just a really expensive water bottle with no benefits.",
      "Finally got it to work correctly. I like the reminders and being able to see my progress but I wish I could sync it to my Samsung health app and/or the my fitness pal app",
      "Purchased this app and spark bottle for post bariatric surgery program. I'm 4 days out of surgery, 3 out of hospital. To this point the bottle is working perfectly. Reminds me 10 times during the day to take a drink. Updates my tablet within about 2-3 minutes with aggregate amount for the day in ounces or millimeters, your choice. Can set with either audio alert on tablet/phone or glow running up and down, or both should you so choose. Could not be more pleased with this product to this point."

      "Pretty nice live water app that lets you use your own background. With that said it needs a few necessary tweaks. When auto ripple is on the drops often make the background a bit noisy with ripples. I believe a slider or menu to adjust the automatic ripple frequency is a must. Also, a least to me, the water seems a bit thick. A slider to adjust the fluidity of the water would be nice. Finally fix the OS compatibility issue. I always get a statement that this was built for an older version.",

      "Love this water tracker! It's fun and easy to use and very motivational! But it won't allow me to purchase the lifetime, only the monthly. Fix that and I'll give 5 stars!!",
      "Puts ads over functions in app you need to use. Could not figure out how to get out of app had to turn phone off. App is total garbage. I did not like little things about the 1st 2 hydration apps i tried but this one is garbage.",
      "This app could be useful. I don't mind ad supported apps, but when ads COMPLETELY block the bottom portion of the app where there are buttons necessary for use, it's absurd. I will not pay to remove ads in an app that I cannot test because of (purposefully?) inconveniently placed ads. Uninstalling and looking for another.",
      "Update 7/21/19 I used to love this app. After the upgrade it doesn't work though. Paid for the \"life time ad removal\" years ago when I first got the app. With the upgrade it doesn't register I've paid. June 30th I emailed them to let them know about the problem. Got emailed back to use \"restore\" button, which did nothing. I let them know. Got a reply to be on for a 5 min time frame to \"purchase for free\" at a time I didn't see email. Have emailed several times since with no reply or fix.",
      "I love it! Simple, fun, and motivational. I enjoy the inspiring image of a body filling up with water as you add ounces, and how confetti goes flying every time you add towards reaching your goal. There's also notifications you can set to remind yourself every hour on the hour to drink water. I'm trying the free 7 day trial, then I'll likely pay for continued full use. Good job for the visually appealing and motivational app."

      "Basic dino game. What I don't like about it is that you need gems to upgrade your dinos, and you can only get them if you watch ads, play a 'minigame', or pay for them at the store. Unless you want to go through the painstaking process of getting only 3 gems when you complete that ONE daily objective that gives you them, just watch the dumb ads. The fights are slow and you'll feel like you just wasted your life when you lose one. Some dino designs are cool, but others just look too similar. 3/5",
      "Amazing game but kept crashing when I get free chests. Now the game won't load. Please fix this I have a lot of 5 star creatures and I don't want to restart.",
      "Its so nice I like evolving this dinos because it's so nice other dinos when you evolve dinos is so fun other dinos is so huge!!!😁😃 I enjoy this game!!!!!!!! Please rate this 5 stars if you dowload this game!!!!! Please!",
      "Fun game. Pity you have to buy gems to buy some of dinosaur eggs. Quite a lot of ads to be watched to get free ones.",

      "[spoilers warning] I truly enjoyed this game's challenges. I didn't give this five stars only for the fact the \"story\" needs embraced.... the ending of each level should be celebrated (the beauty of the fruits of your labor is masked) ... and the last level ends with ______ (?... alll that work for a few ponds? (and the arrow at the end implies there are more \"chapters\", are there more?)... I really encourage you to celebrate wins (Monument Valley, for example)!...OTHERWISE, WOW! 🙃🤓",
      "I managed to play until map 4 before uninstalling, just not my kind of game I guess. Beautiful graphics and soundtrack, relaxing atmosphere, reasonable amount of ads though the banner ads bothers me so much since I can't close it (and it kinda ruined the atmosphere and graphics for me) because it's too close to my phone's screen edge.",
      "Im enjoying this puzzle game immensely! The graphics are beautiful, the music is peaceful and the water effects is so soothing, i wish there is a soundtrack for download so i can sleep to it. I like that there are 2 kinds of level, the timed one and number of moves! Nicely done!!",
      "One of the best game I've seen lately! It's simple, but eye-catching game you are looking for if you want to kill some time and relax. Of course I donated, no doubt it was worth it. Visuals: 10/10 Music: 10/10 (K-Pax inspired) Gameplay: 10/10",

This is where drink water app comes into picture. This simple app helps you stay hydrated by reminding you to drink water.\r\n\r\nCalculate Daily Water Requirement\r\nUsing the drink water app, you can calculate the daily required water intake for you. The app also gives you flexibility to change this target. In other words, on a hot day or after working out, you can increase your water target. This is the starting point to your water diet and it's benefits.\r\n\r\nLog Water\r\nEvery time you drink water, you can easily log it in the app. This helps you keep a track of how much water you are drinking throughout the day. You can even log water for previous days (in case you missed out on logging them in). Each time you log water, the app will tell you how close you've moved to meeting your daily target.\r\n\r\nUnlock Achievements\r\nThe app rewards you for staying hydrated. Keep yourself motivated towards leading a healthy lifestyle by unlocking different achievements. You can even share them and brag about them with friends and family. This helps you make process and reach milestones in a playful manner.\r\n\r\nMonitor and Track\r\nThe app stores historical data of every time you logged in water. This helps you keep a track of how hydrated you have been over a longer period of time. You can monitor the data on a beautiful calendar. The calendar also highlights the dates on which you met your daily targets. This gives you a realistic insight into how long have you been maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWater Drinking Reminder\r\n\"The app sends you notification to remind you to have some water throughout the day. This helps you to keep drinking water at regular intervals even on a busy day.\r\n\r\nNo notifications are sent at night. The app is completely customisable. You also have the option to diable or re-enable the drink water notifications at will.\"\r\n\r\nSupport Across Units\r\nThe app supports both metric and imperial units. Based on the country you live in and your preferences, you can set the unit. This setting can be changed later on as well.\r\n\r\nCustom Cup Size\r\nYou can choose from different cup sizes available on the app or even define your own. Every small bit counts on your journey towards a healthier and hydrated you. It is not just limited to water. This allows you to track other drinks like tea/coffee as well.\r\n\r\nSecure App\r\nThis is a secure app. We are constantly trying to improve the app. We would love to hear your opinion and feedback. Kindly share the same through the app.\r\n\r\nDrinking water at regular intervals is an extremely good habit but difficult to maintain. With drink water app on your side, this becomes easier. \r\n\r\nDehydration is the deficit of water in your body. It affects your metabolism, digestion and general health. It can even speed up the formation of kidney stones.\r\n\r\nIt's time to start drinking water!",

      "This app works great ..... I like the cute little waterdrop that encourages you as you meet your goal of being hydrated. The reminder helps greatly . It has helped me reach for a bottle of water before the alarm does . I set a motivation ringtone for the reminder tone . You can set your own amount of water intake if you wish . You can turn off/on the notifications . I've tried other apps #1 water app in my opinion",
      "What a fantastic app to track my water levels. I am a person who ignores drinking water and gets into dehydration mode quite often leading to some nasty dehydration symptoms. This app gives me a sense of motivation to drink water all the time🙂🙂 and that is a good thing. I personally found this app very seamless and bug free. So would i recommend this to all my loved ones ? Hell Yes !!! Nice job guys !!",
      "Fabulously crafted app!! Simple, yet effective. Like a lot of people, I forget to drink enough water on day to day basis. This app has helped me to make sure that I don't compromise on at least one front when it comes to health, that is, my water intake. Thanks guys for that. It's almost a gift for people like me.Bravo!",
      "Love this app!! Does what it say's rather effectively. Timely reminders have been helping me to keep track of my water intake & stay hydrated, the UI is slick. There are tons of similar apps out there but I found this one to be the best as it's nearly ad-free and very lightweight, meaning uses very fewer resources like RAM and storage. The cherry on top is the 'gamification' or milestones feature which keeps you motivated. Also noteworthy, is the custom cup sizes which help you record your intake in just one click.",
      "I am loving this app. The reminders are helpful & I enjoy the little water drop character cheering me on lol (it's the simple things) if I had to make a suggestion it would be having the presets stay on the page instead of having to change the setting everytime. I go between cups of tea and various sizes of bottled waters so I'm constantly changing the settings. Also, I'd like to be able to keep track of what kind of water I'm drinking i.e. Propel, Essentia, Yogi tea.... other than that.. I love!"
