      "Very detailed and comprehensive app that provides an abundance of data and predictions, to make even the Met Office be able to delve into the deepest crevices of weather. IMO, good app, but just a little too much detail for the average user, who just needs to know if it's going to rain, snow, or become a heatwave. A stripped down version would suit me, as a widget on my Android .",
      "Wonderful app, very reliable. The first thing I do each morning is check the weather, to find out what is ahead for the day. I can proudly state that the weather forecast that I get from this app, is far and above more accurate than anything else out there. Oh by the way, it's absolutely FREE. You can't beat free. I highly recommend this app ... without any reservations - PERIOD!",
      "It's nice and fairly accurate. Couple of strikes against it though *I don't want a large home screen widget. And the smallest of them also shows me the time??? My phone already does that *the time is the only part of the widget that updates quickly. The widget doesn't follow my location, and the temperature takes forever to update",
      "I just love this app. My car was in the shop for quite a while and I had to rely on a bicycle. So I would ride my bike to the bus, (45 mintues away) then take two buses to get to my 1st job. Then walk 10 mintues to my job. When off from the 1st job at 3:30 p.m. take the same 2 buses back and report in to my 2nd job. This app help me to know what the weather would be like in advance. And when waking up at 2:15 a.m. to start your day because your car is in the shop is Beyond very helpful. MLP",
      "The actual app seems good enough at a glance, we'll see how I feel about it in a week. I do, however, take offense at the fact that the first thing I saw after setup was a full-screen ad that I had to close. Pop-up ads are unconscionable on desktop systems, so I don't know why you'd ever consider it appropriate within an app."

The on-going notification often turns itself off in the settings but remains in the notification bar so hasn't updated in hours or days. I've written the developer but have received no response. Going to see if this review gets a response and if not I'll be deleting.",

Extended forecasts that you can set daily or hourly and an easy to use radar that you can customize. There are great videos to watch of weather, nature, animal and other things going on around the world.",
      "Almost as good as it was a year ago. And a long standing problem is the radar for past and future move so fast its difficult to know what time each event is happening so l play it over and over trying to guess when the rain will start or stop or when the red part of the storm is over my location, etc.",
      "Excellent app. This has been the best one thus far. I get real time temps, forecasts, advisories, pollen count, etc. Every place I visit, it gives me current weather conditions. And I'm okay with the ads. I also enjoy weather news and news from around the world plus when I travel I get up to the minute foecasts wherever I go. Valuable.",
      "In my experience this app is consistently the most accurate for my daily observation of conditions in my area. Even more so than the local news stations. I'm always confident that I'm getting the best forcast for planning my week. Thank you. I love the hourly breakdown of conditions to include wind speed and precipitation amounts."

      "My entire family has been utilizing this app for years, and I can say with absolute certainty that Weather Bug has been without a doubt the most reliable and accurate app for weather. We use it for most of our drilling rigs and fracking locations where accuracy is of the utmost importance. We use it for personal and/or government trips when safe travel is strictly needed. Thank you WB for being there each and every time we need you!!!",
      "Like the app overall since there is a local station, BUT for the last few updates, the forecast is WRONG. It may say the low is 22, but scroll through the hourly? Low may be 40. It is not just the app, is the same way if pull up the website. Cannot trust a quick glance anymore. Right most of the time, but a lot of difference between I need to leave the water running and cover the plants and 40. Looking at other reviews, I'm not the only one experiencing the issue.",
      "I like the app and it's about as accurate as it could be. Only bug I've seen yet (no big deal) is, if you don't visit the site every once in a while, the temp on your phone stops changing. All I have to do is go to WeatherBug and after I leave the site, my temp fluctuates again like it should. Good app.",
      "Bad. This app consistently keeps losing functions that I like. First it was the radar animation, which used to keep playing, but now if I move the map, clunk! it stops the animation. Same with zoom in or out. It USED TO work but they took it away and never brought it back. Then, it was the status bar temperature, which USED TO display but now refuses to. I've now switched to Weather & Radar USA, which has BOTH functions working that ceased to work in Weatherbug. Kinda sad to leave WB, but have 2",
      "I'd like it more if it had wind speed next to/under the temp. It's more important here, but I shouldn't have to go looking for it. (And yes, I've customized it, and it's still \"below the fold\"as it were.) Update 200310: looks like they read my above comment, bc I can now see it on the first page and don't have to go look for it, yay!"

      "This has long been one of my favorite apps, but the latest (March 15 2020) version is awful. Lost all my settings, MinuteCast no longer works (just a white dots showing), disabling weather in title bar doesn't work, and no longer report for current location. Adding insult to injury, the ads are now super-intrusive. I've uninstalled on two devices. So did my spouse. I'll try it again in a week or two, unless I find something else that's satisfactory.",
      "It is ridiculous how inaccurate this app is.....not sure where it originates from but it needs to be evaluated for accuracy. Sun shining brightly and it reports it is raining.....and vice versa. Am going to look for another app which at the worst, has some accuracy. This one came on my phone and will,be installing. On the positive side, it does provide us with many laughs.",
      "Loved this app until recently. I do not like ads, at all, so I paid for the ad-free version years ago. I also have a network-level adblocker (pi-hole) . In the last 2 weeks the app has stopped working unless I disable my adblocker or whitelist a ton of advertising and user-tracking domains. Why? I paid for the ad-free version, it should be FREE OF ADS.",
      "I've had this app for years and I have had some of my friends download it,it's the Best,and most reliable.I've never had any problems with it,extremely simple one click open,from 'Home Screen,' that you have the option of in settings and also which I want to know is what's the weather conditions and temperature when I go outside my door and this app can also pinpoint your gps location,so there's no guessing,you'll know.And also,which is extremely important to me,you can recieve important Alerts!",
      "Best weather app I've used, and I've used all of them! Love everything about the app, and think the apps layout is extremely nice too. Accuracy is the best of any weather app I've used, and the radar is probably the best I've seen as well. App isn't without flaws though, which is why it's a 4 star review instead of 5. Minutcast always loses my location for whatever reason, so I always have to manually key it in. Minutecast doesn't update as frequently as it did before either."

      "I've been dealing with the weather channel for years now. I didnt think there was anything better. I installed this app and was blown away with how accurate it was compared to WC. This app gave me the same temp as my car did. The WC said 2° below. Not that 2° is a big deal, but if its wrong on that. What else are they wrong with? Everything!!!! You can also pay a flat fee for app for only 2.99 (which I did), not the new (by year) thing. So far I cant find anything I don't like. BIG THANKS TO DEV",
      "I enjoy the look of this app, how detailed the information is, and many of the customization options in terms of units and skins. There are a few things which would suit my needs better though. I travel between a set of 4 towns regularly. It would be nice if the widget held more than just the current city and could be changed between saved cities by swiping up/down on the widget interface. My previous app did this and I found it tremendously useful. Also my \"current\" city is often incorrect.",
      "My original review was 1 star due to the app not allowing me to search for, and save, the small towns I travel to so I can see weather ahead of time. The problem has since been very rapidly fixed and I appreciate that greatly! There were some language barriers with customer service, but they replied very rapidly and my issue was eventually communicated! I love this app! It is neatly organized, easy to understand, and the ads are not obnoxious! Recommended 👍",
      "It is really too soon for me to give the app 5 stars as I just installed it. However, it is showing the forecast quite nicely as other apps that I have been using don't or have quit doing so. Plus, if the main critical reviews are about celcius/Fahrenheit and military/civilian times, then I believe this is probably going to be a good weather app.",
      "The app itself is sensational. Lots of different information to help me see what's going to be happening throughout the day. My biggest issue is with the widgets. If the clock updates itself, then why does my weather not update until I tap the widget and open it? What good is this widget if it won't update itself?"

Coronavirus is news not weather and I pay for no advertising. Many people have had enough hearing about this and don't need it staring you in the face everytime you want to see the weather forecast.

      "3/19/20 Update: THANK you for bringing back the temperature notification! Back to 5 stars. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 3/17/20 Update: the new version removed one of my favorite features. The notification bar icon used to show the 2 digit outside temperature, but now it shows a weather condition icon (cloud, sun, etc.). This is terrible. Please, either make that icon customizable, or return it to the temperature! My favorite weather app. Been using it for 2 years. Love the widget.",
      "This app used to be great, but since the new web design the app has not worked. It is now useless. Since thenew web design went into effect my local temperature shows to be a constant 70° F , 24 hours a day, which in truth is not. JUST ADDED 3/17/2020 I did send an email to the support team the same day I wrote this post.",
      "Great app. Very accurate weather. One critique would be on the Daily Weather icons, if rain is expected AT ALL during the 24 hour time frame of that day, the icon for that day shows up as the cloud/rain icon. The hourly could show sunshine all day from 6am to 8pm, but if it's going to rain from 8pm to Midnight, the Icon for the entire day on the daily forecast will show Rain. Wish they could do split icons. Sun/Rain, for AM sun, afternoon rain or vice versa."

    "description":"MyRadar is a fast, easy-to-use, yet powerful weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location, allowing you to quickly see what weather is coming your way. Just start the app, and your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours.  This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a fast snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years.  Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the data layers, MyRadar has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Center, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts.  A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts;  our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry.  Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration.

    "descriptionHTML":"MyRadar is a fast, easy-to-use, yet powerful weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location, allowing you to quickly see what weather is coming your way. Just start the app, and your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours.  This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a fast snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it&#39;s what has made MyRadar so successful over the years.  Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.<br><br>In addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the &quot;wildfires&quot; layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.<br><br>In addition to the data layers, MyRadar has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Center, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts.  A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.<br><br>One of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts;  our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry.  Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration.

      "Wow - - I have no idea what you all did to the app but WHOA - I can't set a single thing. The radar maps moves faster than the speed of light. My local is messed up AND I lost everything that has to do with Hawai'i. I can´t seem to be able to reset anything. I'm a stormspotter and can't use this anymore. DAMN! I'm sure you know the phrase - if it's not broke, don't fix it. Well, it wasn't broke. I'm a thinkin T'm gonna uninstall it! Sorry, it only gets 1 star and I'm being nice. HELP!!",
      "I love this app. It has been fairly accurate . I use it all the time tracking snow storms in winter. As an otr truck driver the wind and weather paterns are important. I guess i been useing it over 2 years now. This updated version is working smoothly and looks good. Developers , you guys an gals have done a great job . Sorry i haven't left yall a review sooner.",
      "free version is very good, paid version is great. I like how i can turn on things like wind layers, earthquakes, high resolution maps, temperature overlays. One thing i wish was an option with the temperature layer is that it could be in vector form or topological instead of data bubbles.. other than that, pretty impressive powerful app with lots of options",
      "It is absolutely great!!! When Google weather tries to start sending \"stuff,\" I disable it. I checked out The National Weather Service app, it's so archaic. MyRadar is so neat! You can zoom in and out, move it to someplace else you want to see what the weather is doing or check out what the weather is doing where a relative or friend lives or is visiting. There are so many different informational choices to turn on or off and types of information or screens to switch to. An info packed app!!!",
      "MyRadar is exactly what it says it is. A radar that is exceotional. It is very easy to personalize and use. Besides precipitation it will also show the wind direction and speed, making it very easy to pinpoint fronts. Absolutely no intrusive ads. Your location and favorites weather and forecasts are updated every few minutes. As you maneuver around the map wherever you stop will show the name and weather for that area. This is anywhere in the world. Very simply the best radar and weather app"

There is even a widget thank God. I am very very very happy with this app and will recommend 100% to all of my friends. I will try and support the developers by sending some coffee money.",
      "A well designed weather app: clean, functional, accurate, and with live + future radar in UK and Europe. Great that you can choose from different weather providers. The developer clearly loves what they're doing and the result is an awesome app. They even did this with zero ads and that alone is a big win, deserving of support. I'm looking forward to how this app continues in development and if there's one thing I would like to see added, it would be weather alerts. Thank you, 5 stars!",
      "I am happy to say that this app has replaced WU after IBM screwed it up. This is the best replacement to date. Great layout of info with the exception of the large image that loads at startup. I would like an option to disable that photo and jump right into the meat and potatoes. You've got a good app here; careful not to screw it up like others in this industry! Great work!",
      "Everything looks great, but I hate 12-hour clock. The widget itself displays 24-hour time, but everything in the window it opens is 12-hour. Edit: changing to 5 stars then. But you may want to make this setting have the default value derived from system settings. As it was different in different places, I never thought it was configurable, looked hardwired to me.",
      "I just installed this and so far it looks like the best weather app out of the 10 or so I have tried. It even lets you choose from five different weather provider sources! Clean layout, small app footprint, well-designed. The only thing I would like to see is the ability to save different Geographic locations. As it is now every time I want to see a forecast for another state or region I have to search for it."

      "IBM has broken what didn't need to be fixed. After 7 years I'll be uninstalling and finding something new. My favorite aspect was the Summary. Now it's hidden and a few clicks to get to it. No, it doesn't have a cleaner interface at all. The graphics are Chunky and squished together making it hard to read. It used to be that the daily weather was spread out and looked nice. I guess IBM (the new owner) had to squeeze in more room for ad revenue. Edited to add: Now it keeps crashing. Yayy!",
      "Update as of 3/14 recognizes that I'm a paying subscriber and has removed the ads that should never have been there in the first place. I remain wary of how future updates will be handled. This was such a great app before the redesign, but it feels like every step forward since then has been two steps back in some other part of the app. I appreciate the quick response from the devs, it's honestly all that kept me from moving on to another app. Here's to second chances...",
      "This new version is not better. The radar now a little better. I would like to customize everything I see and look at. I don't care about the pollin count and would like to eliminate it. My biggest issue is I want weather from AIRPORTS and not some unknown weather station managed by a \"bunch of college students\". Even though I paid for it, I will not use it. Why do people insist on fixing something that's not broke in the first place?",
      "Been using this app for years and years - some bugs along the way, but mostly a great experience. The latest UI change basically gimps the whole thing with more ads and the removal of the Smart Forecast feature which I used regularly. $4/mo for 'premium'? Every other app I've used has a small one-time fee that I would have gladly paid. And it still has that ridiculous 5-second splash screen... I'm done.",
      "I do like the app, BUT, when I had first downloaded it on my tablet / glorified alarm clock, 3yrs ago the smart forecast feature was free, I downloaded it to my phone to be able to use said feature and now it costs, I'm NOT going to spend money on a feature that was ONCE FREE.! The developer sold out, you already get Ad revenue from the ads you have in the app, which I presume will still be there after buying a subscription. #sellout"

      "Really a GREAT app but to use the widgets (or the hyperlocal stuff) you have to buy the premium which is only 3 bucks but that's not the point. I've got at least 4 other weather apps that I can utilize all of the functions on if I don't mind ads. Pay to have temp on the status bar? Please. I don't think so. The radar is fantastic and the interface is pleasant to look at & if you want to use it, it's pretty great. It just doesn't have the features every other app has for free.",
      "I've tried NOAA and Ventusky before Dark Sky and its by far the most accurate, best looking, and with far fewer bugs. I had an issue with my premium subscription and their customer service was very quick to provide me with a solution that fixed my issue. Couldn't be happier with it, I recommend it to friends and co-workers frequently.",
      "Wow so far this app is amazing! I've been looking for something new since Wunderground destroyed their app at the beginning of the year. I'm not one who usually subscribes to premium but on this one I'm going to give it a try. My only suggestion to the developers is please let me change the barometer from millibar (MB) to inches of mercury (inHg).",
      "Great weather app. I used the Weather Underground app for years until the recent horrible \"upgrade\" ruined it. After trying many alternatives I settled on Dark Sky. It doesn't have the wonderful informative and customizable graph that I miss in WU, but it does seem to be very accurate and is easy and intuitive to use. I wish I customize the interface a bit to better reflect my preferences.",
      "Agree with others, the Android only subscription is BS. The upcoming weather and Todays weather don't match. Recently the hyper local weather (your bread and butter) has been incorrect. More widgets...if I'm paying for them please make them. A hyper local widget with the next 15 min - 3 hrs would be great, or a daily graph, or both! Longer forecast is often wrong."

      "I live less than 5 miles from the reporting site. It is great to have instant weather info. No more gadgets at my window with a wire hanging out my window and the mess every time you open the window. When I am away I can get. Instant weather back home so that I know what kind of weather I will be driving into what could be any better? Nothing for me!",
      "gives me my local weather, 7 days in advance. tells temp., wind, precipitation, can expand the day to get the full 24 hours for that day. love the radar to see if rain or snow is coming how far away it is to know when it hits my area. NOAA weather is accurate, complete, and fun to use also. Always right if you follow the info u will see",
      "Good data representation. Hourly graph allows a quick, \"in one glance\" evaluation of what's to come. I would give it 5 stars but for one problem - labeling of the day. It's not easy to understand the boundaries of the days when you zoom & scroll. The movable day bar at the bottom and the dark blue/lighter blue stripes (they could be improved too) are only partially helpful. I suggest it would be easier to read the graph, if the horizontal axis retained the day label at all zoom levels.",
      "Everything is right there on the page . No scrolling down the page through endless ads trying to find information. The tabs on the top give you all the extra information I'm looking for. Click on the days weather and it expands for more information. Finally a weather app that gives you the weather. If I want videos I'll go to YouTube. Thanks NOAA for a great app!!",
      "This app gives you the real-time NOAA updates and alerts. The radar is accurate and the hourly forecast is customizable. Also, you can choose where you want a forecast from on a map, so if you live in the middle of nowhere you can still receive an accurate detailed forecast. You can only harbor up to 3 locations, but for me that's plenty because you can delete past locations if need be. I would reccomend this app for anybody who is a weather nut, a meteorologist, or a storm chaser."

      "***Update*** I gave 5 stars before because it's a very nice app. It worked well back then. Now it has started to fail. I can't get a weather updated because the app widget doesn't update temperature and conditions unless I go to the app and update it myself. But when I go to the app it keeps crashing and don't let me see the actual conditions outside. I guess the developer went to jail or just became lazy and don't want to update the app. Oh well, too bad for them. I'm getting another one.",
      "All looks awesome. One problem, the weather in the notifications never changes to what the weather really is. It showed 42 degrees when it was 24 degrees ...huge difference. This needs fixed asap. Signed a paid customer EDIT: WISH I could get my money back. No response at all and no fix. Uninstalled, useless and dropping to 1 star.",
      "The first impressions of the application are the most pleasant. But..., the widget really does not update the temperature and weather conditions. You have to go into the application and then the info on the widget updates. We will not see ads, if it does this itself. After all, advertising is only in the full version of the program. Presumably if you pay for the Pro version (it is without ads), the widget will update the weather information.",
      "Finally an app that tells the truth. All the other app's comes with ads and viruses. Always with something more then what you want. (or less). This App and \"Weather Bug\" are side by side. \"Thank you\" now I can rest easy. 🌪 let the rains come, I'm ready now; or sun shine. ✌🌝👍 Yes!",
      "The widget would be good if it updated itself instead of waiting for the user to open the full app. Not useful as a widget as is. Decent accuracy for the forecasts. Nice amount and variety of information provided. Radar image is small, a long way down the list of information modules (which can't be adjusted in the preferences), and must be clicked open once you've scrolled down to it in order to see the information it can provide."

      "First off this is the best way to find out the weather forecast. What I mean by that is that it's better to combine a less than desirable weather forecast with hilarious phrases about the days weather. I also think it's a nice touch that you can put in what you think qualifies as too hot and cold so that phrases are appropriate for your temperature threshold. Oh, and let's not forget the profanity filter. So if your like me and swear a lot you can turn profanity on, or select minimal or some.",
      "UPDATED: Developer discovered the cause of the issues and quickly rolled out an update to correct the problem. Original review below: Like many others, my app is stuck on an old weather status/forecast and won't update. I've cleared the cache, force-stopped it, etc and even when I start it all over and it reloads, it's still (drastically) wrong information. It's been days and it's not worth spending any more time messing with at this point. Too bad, it's a fun weather app when it actually works.",
      "I love this app. I live in Portland, OR, where it rains easily 9-10 months out of the year. I look forward to the snarky messages putting words to my mood wben I have to go out in it...& the smug ones when ol' Sol deigns to show his face. Great for a laugh at least once a day...& in spring & fall, at least a dozen times. Thanks!",
      "Let's face it, you can check the weather on your phone in 2 seconds but this....this app always adds a giggle with its quotes....I would rather laugh while I get my \"crappy\" weather report vs just get my weather report. It also looks good, easy to use and reliable. Never had a glitch or 1000 pop up ads. Its AMAZING!!!!!!",
      "Installed it, added my location, then the S.F. forecast was replaced by a blank blue screen. I hope you get the bugs worked out, cuz this has potential. Also would be great if the quotes stayed on the screen until the user swiped/tapped the screen. Good stuff there!"

      "If you're looking for a replacement for Weather Underground (R.I.P.), then Today Weather is perfect for you. Great UI, aside from a tad too much scrolling to get to an extended forecast. Excellent and transparent selection of data inputs, and the radar information is snappier than many 1st party apps. I wish the widget contained more info than just the temperature and a precipitation graphic, but it is attractive.",
      "I purchased the full version of this application. , But i am not satisfied as the location services is not working properly. Whenever I travel from one place to other place , i enable GPS and mobile data to check the current location weather,but the application never detects the current location and the whole application bacome blank.",
      "Honestly I'm a big fan of this app, for the most part the forecast is pretty accurate. I also like the fact that you can customize it. I just have a couple of problems with this app. I really don't like that you have to pay for the damn radar, to turn on severe weather alerts (rain & snow) also instead of showing random pictures you should actually show pictures of the location . For example, if your in NY then show a picture of NY that would be dope other than that it's good.",
      "Please fix the radar! Everything else in this app is done beautifully, until you get to the radar. It doesn't show the history of the rain/storm. Just \"current\" and then the future prediction of where the storm is going. It doesn't look as good as most other radar graphics I've seen as well. Myradar used to be my app until they killed it with a very ugly UI update. I do think they have the best radar however.",
      "By far the best weather app available. It's accurate, looks great and there are 17 widgets to choose from. What I like most about the widgets is that I can make most of them transparent. Once again a very accurate and nice looking app!"

      "It keeps putting my location in a different city than where I actually live! Then, it won't let me remove the inaccurate data/location. This is not only inaccurate, but Very Annoying. If this continues, I will just have to find a different, better app.",
      "It has graphics that are really likeable, asked neat, although I feel like there's not enough information. For example, whilst there's a slider that tells you the weather, hour by hour, I think there should be info that says if the rain, for example, is heavy, or light, a short burst, or prolonged. Also, the slider is always placed three hours (or something) away from the hour you're actually in. A bit confusing why, although you can just move it back to the hour you want. A great app though!",
      "So far I am very pleased with this Weather app. When installed and then opened the first time it asked to allow location. After I accepted it opened immediately to my county and displayed the temperature that matched my digital readout here at home. It has been within a degree or two ever since. Easy to use and the ads are not intrusive at all. I've tried many Weather apps and none come close to this, the Weather app. Let's hope it continues along this well.",
      "Nice clean modern weather app. It would be perfect if it just had a 1x5 widget, with a clock/date that takes you to the clock/calendar apps. Also, accurate forecasts are really important and it seems quite hit and miss - for example, yesterday it was 45°C (MEL) and this app showed a forecast of just 33°C right up till that morning, while weather websites and news forecast 40-45° a week ago!",
      "Easy to see, Fast & easy to use.. NO nonsense! Shows lunar stages plus 24 hour temperature grid with ease. The best, just love this app!"

      "STAY AWAY!! Hey look I'm changing my rating because I pay the sub fee and I still get ads and I cannot use all the features!! I double checked and when I attempted to \"upgrade\" it tells me already have it! Also it wont even let me report an issue! Fix this or I'm out! Edit: I canceled my sub because its still not working and I never received a response either here or the support email address. Very sad that they dont care about their customers. I'm moving on because this is a terrible app!",
      "Poor features left to use. The storm tracks being pulled was the last straw for me a while back. Without this feature this app is just another run of the mill weather app. Now if you want it, you need to pay. I guess the adds weren't enough income for them. You can find a better app with NOAA or the weather channel. Save your money",
      "An utter disappointment. When Weather Underground owned this app, it was the most useful storm and weather tracking app you could ask for. Weather Channel has turned it into a worthless money-grab. Sattelites and views locked down as 'premium content'. Spam and banners cluttering the view. Selling location data to god-knows-who. Shameful.",
      "The good part of this app is that it takes you immediately to the radar so you can see what happening right away. If there is a storm approaching, you'll see it right away without having to fiddle around. It also has a feature that projects the weather radar a few hours into the future, so you can see when the storm will clear. The only reason I am not giving the app five stars is because you cannot buy it outright. If you don't want adds, you have to buy a subscription.",
      "Loads and runs very fast, compared to other apps. Much smoother animation. The radar color-scheme is odd in \"dark mode\" - severe rain-cells (yellow-orange-red) always have a \"halo\" around them where there is apparently no rain, and then the green \"mild\" rain area appears outside of the halo. The color scheme only makes sense in \"light mode\". But otherwise a decent app."

      "This used to be a good app. I paid for the ad free version years ago but now the ad free version has disappeared from the Google play. I've emailed the developer twice now but they haven't got back to me. The time on the widget doesnt sync with my phone time, sometimes up 20mins difference. I suspect the developer is giving up on this app which is a shame.",
      "Overall decent app, but I really don't like the graphical representation of the hourly and 10-day forecast, which is completely different from the prior version I had installed. It should at least allow the option to display either graphically (the new way), or the more tabular, scrolling option (as it was before). This is a huge reason I am reluctant to update any app that has been meeting my needs for years: someone decides to fix something that isn't broken, then forces it on everyone else.",
      "Honestly a great app. I've been using this thing for years and installed on every subsequent new phone, mostly because of the great options for customization. It's quick and responsive and allows you to create wigdets that suit your needs. When you enter the app it does have ads but none of those obnoxious and annoying ones. 5/5 my dudes. Nice!",
      "I really love having this widget with a very large clock and the real temperature with a \"feels like\" listed as well. But too frequently, the weather clock, the big clock, and the real time are all different. The two clocks on the widget freeze and break and the only thing I can do to reset it is restart my phone. There has to be a better way.",
      "Latest update w/Android 10 has issues. Clock on home screen doesn't sync at least 30% of time upon waking phome, have to open app to sync (suspect it has to do with not allowing any apps on my phone to use battery while NOT open, but I think that was what was draining my battery so fast). Temp hasn't synced a few times either. Three stars because it's generally a good app and it's my go to home page weather/clock app, but it needs improvement."

      "This is an odd one. I really like the UI and the accuracy seems ok BUT, unless it's just me, I can't get the thing to automatically show me the weather based on my GPS location. And that applies both to the app and the widget. I keep thinking I must be missing something as no-one would design a weather app that can't work out where you are. So if I've missed something obvious, can someone let me know how to change this setting and I'll update my review.. If not, it's a massive oversight IMO.",
      "So far no complaints. I use this app a a lot for outside projects. It's very informative without the miles of scrolling getting through all the useless news stories that are found on other weather apps. Easy to use, and informative. A refreshing combination.",
      "Loving this app, after installing and uninstalling countless weather apps. Appreciate the comprehensive coverage without the visual clutter. Also enjoy that, at first glance, the windspeed and direction is displayed without having to click on each day to get that info. Keeping this app. Thank you.",
      "Today: No response if the faulty behavior will be fixed, and when. Uninstalling the app. Yesterday: Widget does not update by itself. Update interval was earlier one hour, later I set it to half hour. No use. Need to click on the widget to launch the app, only after which update in widget takes place. Otherwise, stale temperature from whenever the app was last launched is displayed on the widget. Phone is Realme, on Android 9",
      "This is a very good app for weather and is clear to understand. You can choose different colour themes and it has videos and pictures. It covers 14 days weather and it is good at being able to get other locations."

The 10 day is not hour by hour either. Free apps and paid apps that are less have more map features like pressure maps and wind maps. What this app is it does well more features for the current pro version are high in my opinion. And no real free version (3 day pro trial then sub)",
      "Accurate, Easy to use, and Affordable. **EDIT** I changed from a 5 star to a 4 because it is frustrating to watch the radar, seeing what is headed in your direction, then...grrrr... have to go to a different site to find out inches; even though you paid for the subscription.",

      "I have a Xperia 10 mobile and was missing out on the weather app from previous Sony mobiles. Now I can have the same weather app and widgets as before so thank you for uploading. The experience is clean and easy to read and so are the widgets. It may not be for everyone but it is enough for me.",
      "App works well for the current temp and a general reading for the next 3 days, but the app is very undetailed. I think at least an hourly forecast should be implemented. The widgets are wonderful though, and are the main reason I keep this app over others.",
      "Not particularly useful. Shows the time and nothing else at the moment. Doesn't expand to show temperatures or predicted weather. The widget is pretty useless.",
      "Over one year after contacting Sony about a number of showstopping bugs, nothing. Still not automatically updating to the correct GPS location. I am apparently in Helensburgh today, some 328 miles away! When can we expect a resolution? There has been no replies to any of my emails, after almost one year. Ignoring customers comments on Play Store too! Such contempt for your customers and not even a mailbox auto reply thanking customers for their email. Please can you reflect on these concerns?",
      "Totally useless app refused to believe were I live, gives me rediculous weather alerts and forecasts for locationd hundred of miles away. Unfortunately I can't uninstall it because it's a Sony app. Now takes an age to open and even worse to close unless you restart the phone. DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."

I thought that maybe buying the app it will fix these issues but not at all. I verified the FAQs page, check the settings, restart the settings and nothing works. Also the page, when you're looking for help is not friendly at all. I'm really disappointed as I used top have this app before and love it. Deleting and requesting refund.",
      "I used to have this app on another phone and i loved it. Now, it wont even pick up my location.... and yes i have my location on! I just dont know what the deal is. Why isnt it working for me? Id gladly give it 5 stars if i could fix this problem....",
      "The app worked for the most part. But over time it went downhill. It stopped refreshing on it's own. A few times I would refresh it myself but the wait time seemed to get longer each time I did so. When I would go into the menu to adjust something the menu icon would disappear entirely afterwards. I hope these bugs get fixed, the humor in this app is the only reason I keep it.",
      "I just dl'd this not that long ago for the humor and it hasn't disappointed. I keep it on a side page, but seriously, it keeps me and my bestie in stitches. Sometimes you just need some off color humor in something so normal to make everything else okay.",
      "I've downloaded many many apps in the past. This is the first one I felt deserved my time to rating. Great app!! Good job!! Fowl as f#<[, but lots of weather related information."

      "Best weather app out there and I really enjoy the puppy's they are so cute!! This app just makes my day. Anyone who uses this app n if u have any issues please don't do what I did and give bad review just email them and they will help you with any problems with their app. They helped me and responded quick. CAN YOU PLEASE ADD SHIH ZUHS !!!!!!!",
      "Cute! Almost always accurate. I've been using this app for several years on both iPhone and Android, and I love it!",
      "I love this so! It makes me happy. How can you beat that!? Plus, I can keep a weather eye on family in different areas. How cool is that!",
      "Nice app I can have my breed of dog on my weather screen (German Shepherd) but I'd like to see an option to imbed a photo or photos of my all Black German Shepherd into the app, and my neighbor would like to be able to add his all white German Shepherds into the app as well as his other German Shepherds. And also the litter of puppies he just had!",
      "Makes me very happy to see the puppies everyday plus informed of the weather. The only feature I wish it had was a small list of stats (not necessary but helpful / fun ) I've seen on some weather apps - telling allergy index, if need umbrella, if good weather for running etc . But honestly id rather have puppies fetch my weather and I can figure that part out myself. (However, if the developers are reading this and want to add these or port them in from another app, would make this app even )"

I will give 5 stars when the developer fixes that. Hope developer will fix it soon....Thank you.",

But, I have one problem that occurs me over and over, it keep reminds me the same thing every day that to bring an umbrella whenever I go out. Even my country right now facing prolonged drought.

      "Really useful meteogram that is missing two things : 1) the temperature Y axis is not clearly labeled. Maybe add horizontal lines for each 5 degrees and have the number clearly on the middle of the line to the right. 2) For the widget, it would be great if it showed the current conditions in a box to the right. Temperature large, smaller wind and precipitation maybs.",
      "This has been an amazing app. Truly well done. It was something that I used daily. I had the silver subscription which included several models. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that even though I have a subscription, now I have to pay more to get the same models that I was getting before. Why did I pay for a subscription with the promised models only to have them removed after I had paid. Very disgruntled about this.",
      "Great weather app - my first go to for the weather. Most Popular apps have really rudimentary radars built in and basic descriptions of the days e.g. sunny with cloudy periods - not flow.x. This app has helped me plan my weekends by seeing exactly what weather is headed our way. Upgraded to a pro subscription to sorry the dev as it's so useful.",

      "Been using this for years and depend on it. It has a lot of very good features. This corrects a prior 2 star review. I updated to a later version of Android and was using an older version of this app. The current version works fine.",
      "This is very useful app & once you get used to it, it's very easy to navigate. I uninstalled & reinstall it again & now it disconnect when you switch to a new window.",
      "Good for what it does, but don't expect bells and whistles from it. What this app is, is a honest reporting of the freely available information from the NWS. What it is not, is fripperies and doodads to animate things or pretend it can forcast for 45 days. I do wish, though, I could set an auto-update schedule for the notification bar weather (like every hour, or when the reporting starting updates) which is why I withheld a 🌟 and call the app good, instead of great.",

      "The app has some great features, is detailed, and seems accurate. However, you can't swipe to quickly check on other locations you've saved as you can with other weather apps. It is more cumbersome to view, for example, weather at wotk or where you plan to travel. And the widget is very limited on what you can display. For me, it's slways the little details that make an app great. This app doesn't have those details.",
      "One of the best free weather apps I have found. I have tried them all in the last few weeks. While they all have nice features, this app gives me just what I needed. The simple feature of following you on your GPS, without hitting too many buttons is what I really wanted. There was another Dark app that I subscribed to for a year, but I really don't want to pay for weather. This app will not disappoint.",
      "Showing actual clouds and rain data every 15 minutes is the thing that makes this app deserving 5 stars. However, in the latest update, I am unable to see the 12 hrs past actual clouds. I really liked that feaure. Also it would be great if there was an option to remove the blue/pink patch that overlaps the actual clouds in the map, so as I could see the actual cloud image when it is raining heavily. Thanks",
      "The app is perfect with regard to weather information. However, It is surprising to note that this app shows India is a neighbor of Afghanistan. I wonder the source of this map, as it is factually wrong. I encourage you to correct it according to the ground reality of internationally accepted boarders of the world. Unless, you have an ambition to promote political propaganda in this region.",
      "I really like this app. The radar map in particular allows you to see what kind of weather is heading your way. Lots of good detail about temperature and wind direction - we live by the sea and the latter is very important!"

      "Revising from 5 to 4 stars because app doesn't remember last map position, zoom in level or play or pause mode selected. One must also clear off the weather statements/outlook things each time if you don't want them in the way. Just let the number of those represent. I've also noticed even though I can zoom out to see most of the continental US on my tablet I can't on my phone even though it's the same OS. Still my go to weather radar app at the moment.",
      "I've used another weather app for quite some time and have been relatively pleased with its accuracy - even the radar. But comparing this to that one, this is hands-down more accurate. My other app forecasted a slight chance of snow, with nothing showing on the radar. I opened this app and it showed a small patch of snow falling where I live. I looked out the window and was amazed at the accuracy. What made it even more amazing was 5 minutes later it showed the snow had ended. It did.",
      "This app is Ok, but it could use some upgrades. For instance, a satellite map showing villages, towns, and cities with weather systems (rain, snow, etc.) superimposed over it would be a vast improvement. As it is now, we don't really know where in the country we are. A longer time frame would also be helpful for the animated portion; it is currently so brief that it's hard to get a picture of the direction systems are moving.",
      "A weather app that has no current temp is not very useful for planning your day. I've used the app for several years and for the most part, I've liked it. However, the last update removed the current temp, making it near impossible to plan my day. The weather is important in my every day life, I'm a farmer and the weather drives everything I do. Please fix your app, I don't want to delete you, as you have been important in my life for years now, like an old friend.",
      "I have had this app before and very accurate in its weather. But I went ahead and got something more where I could see other countries weather. Come to find out all these has a weather apps want money, like a monthly fee. I just went back to Radar Express because it's always been a good app on the weather. This is the reason I give it five stars because it's an excellent app"

      "Great app and radar is excellent. However, some of the narratives in the detailed forecast don't make much sense. But I am used to those statements and I just laugh it off. For the most part, I view this app every morning and it beats the weather channel.",
      "I like the way the view starts with the entire U.S. and lets one get an overview. We do a lot of driving trips, coast to coast, and timing our departure times from Minnesota to have the best chance to avoid bad weather is really helpful. Local TV coverage rarely does that. Zooming in to our current local is quick & easy and provides the more detailed view of current conditions. Great app and always seems to work.",
      "Widget stuck in endless \"Preparing...\" or \"Updating...\" loops. \"Retry\" usually results in a System message saying \"Weather Radar Widget keeps stopping\". \"Info\" links to \"Error Details\" telling me to check my internet connection (which is fine) or that \"we may be experiencing technical difficulties & your should try again in a few hours\". Well I've tried again for several months now & it's still fails. Gave up on any hope that the developer gives a damn. Reduced to 1 star.",
      "It's simple to use, but it is different than the Raindar app that is not updated for recent Android versions. Raindar would remember the area you were viewing even without gps. Plus you could scroll all the way into your neighborhood and the radar colors wouldn't pixelate. I've tried several others, but so far weather radar widget is the closest to Raindar which was the gold standard",
      "I have always been an avid weather watcher, but radar almost tells it all and it's my preferred method of what's going on and what's gonna happen by me. Wind speeds would be nice. I do have to apologize, but I haven't used your sight for at least 2 months. We take down trees and there just isn't enough hours in the day, but I choose your app for the simplicity of it. Keep up the good work!"

      "I have tried many different weather apps but this one is perfect for me. (I've been using this app since July 2018) The circle widget is gorgeous and also includes the date and time allowing me to remove the standard clock widget. Information is very detailed and the forecast has always been accurate. I recently reported an issue to the developer and received a reply less than half an hour later! They resolved my issue very quickly (less than an hour from my initial email). Fantastic!!",
      "Most of the important information on this app is premium edition, I have multiple weather apps on my phone and Weather Live was the only one that alerted to lightning 15 miles away. The only problem is that the nearest lightning to me was 734 miles away. So I checked the location and it was accurate to my location. I clicked to see where the lightning was and I was sent to a page to buy premium. Its pretty shady to give fake alerts just to sell subscriptions. Weather Bug is much better.",
      "Very helpful for, it's detail in weather information needed. Also, other weather feaures I didn't know exist and now learning to apply. Just hope the live direction compass could be included in any proper box or space with map of viewer's desired location searched. Just a thought.., 10-Q mucho much. It's 2020 & Weather Live is still excellent running.., 10-Q again.",
      "Really, really good! Visually, very appealing and also has lots of information. Layout is now customizable. Downsides (and reason for only 4 stars): Monthly subscription for ad-free version is steeper than I'd like. And as good as the graphics, icons, and layout is, I'd like to see an option to read a text summary of the immediate forecast.",
      "Has been the most accurate and useful weather app I've used. Incredibly was even the most accurate during hurricane season, while local forecasters and even the weather channel were using a plate of spaghetti to plot hurricane paths the predictions on here were very close if not dead on. This will be my go to next hurricane season."

      "10 DAY FORECAST I have been using this specific 'Weather App', along with adding the weather widget to my Samsung Galaxy S8 cell phone & my Samsung Galaxy Note and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I can add as many cities in the USA, although with ANYWHERE in the world, (my husband's family have a 2nd home in Crete, Greece off the side of a mountain overlooking the beautiful water and they go there in the summer (mid June-mid-late August), thereby allowing me to see what type of weather they are enjoying!",
      "It has great widgets, a good layout and the daily update is a wonderful feature, but it has no \"feels like/real feel\" which often makes this inaccurate at best. Would be a fantastic app if it had real feel (with it also shown on the widget) but for now you'd be better off installing another.",
      "Increase the touch sensitive area for the day's weather! I've to specifically touch on the day text(MON/TUE/etc) to view the weather for that day. Please increase the touch area to include the rectangle box around the day's text too.",
      "I've used this as my sole wx app for about a year, but giving it the heave-ho now. It is so brain dead when it comes to adding new locations. Today I tried to add Chicago and Atlanta and it could not find them!",
      "I loved this widget on my old phone but now that I've downloaded the app on my new phone, I cannot add custom locations which makes this pretty much useless to me. Also, the developers haven't bothered to respond to my question about the issue."

      "Looks really good for the most part, but I don't like the way that the notification works in Android dark mode. What I mean by that is that some of the sliders are inverted in the way that they work and some of the icons (material) don't show up at all because they're supposed to be all white or something (specifically fog). If this small issue was fixed, than I will give it five stars, but I think $7.50 where one of the main features of that price tag doesn't work all of the time isn't right.",
      "Beautiful app but doesn't seem to update as fast as other apps. Had a thunderstorm happen and it reports it as a cloudy day meanwhile other apps report thunderstorms and rain. Shame.",
      "I was told by one of the developers that if one wants to know expected SNOW amounts, one clicks on \"RAIN\" in the hourly forecast. I guess it's just me, but I find that counterintuitive. Perhaps \"rain/snow\" would be a better option for that particular click ? Or simply \"Precip\"? (I will have to wait & see if that works as there is no snow expected here in Vermont for the next week.)",
      "Hands down the best weather app, no other option on the store comes close to it. I wish there were a few more themes, but that would just be icing on the cake.",
      "VERY nice layout and presentation....using lousy data (Dark Sky). Right now Overdrop shows cloudy, drizzle and 80% chance of precipitation. In fact, it's sunny, clear skies and everyone else shows 0% chance of precip. (And, yes, I double-checked the location. This is not the first time I've seen forecasts based on Dark Sky data be this incorrect). It's a shame because it's not really the developers's fault, but there's really no point in keeping this app. Developer replies that they've added \"two more\" providers. In the free version, I see only one more: Weather Bit, which seems to do better. But to get AccuWeather, you must pay. Review has been increase by 2 stars."

      "Awesome app BUT... the last update (v2.606) screwed up the \"Hourly Trend\" widget. It worked fine for about 2 weeks. Now all of sudden the widget does NOT update automatically. I have to force an update by opening the app. On my wish list... I have set updates to occur once per hour. I wish those updates would occur consistently, a few seconds after the top hour (instead of just randomly). Thanks In Advance. (sidenote: re-installed v2.601, widget auto-update works as expected)",

I'm having a wonderful time with this app. It has replaced all my weather apps up to this point and has established itself as my go-to app whenever I need to inform myself about the weather. The cute animations are particularly pleasing and the info available is not overwhelming as in ome other apps, which is quite refreshing. The app itself is quite easy to use as well.

I also can't figure out how to keep it on just my city and not go to a park i have never heard of let alone know it's location. If the developer could help me, I would gladly give if 5☆ ! I do love this app otherwise! Great job!**updated same day Awesome Yo Window explained it to me. It was just stupidity on my part! Lol! Thanks again Yo Window!",
      "Best live wallpaper I've tried. The create landscape feature is really good specially the sky erase with easy but accurate selection. Honestly though, you can improve the UI a little bit for some users might not be able to use all the features, just keep it minimal and organized. Anyways, this app is really underrated imo, I hope it gets the recognition it deserves. Keep creating and innovating! Thank you, YoWindow team for this wonderful app!",
      "when scrolling on the time scale update: can you please fix the scrolling? its very counterintuitive. it should scroll from left to right when you slide your finger from right to left, but its doing the opposite. Best weather and clock widget. Opens weather app and alarm clock. Doesn't take too much space on the screen.",

It gives completely different information for the days and weeks, temp, rain cloud etc... what is going on when they can't even supply accurate information for the same town location, which is just a local forecast. Don't spend any money on this rubbish. Would give no stars if I could.",
      "YoWindow is one of my favorite apps! It's a fun and accurate weather app. I love that the 'live' landscapes are a bit interactive and fun to watch, AND that they change with the seasons and holidays! (I've added it to my tv and computer as well) Two thumbs way up! :)"

      "since last update (Feb-2020) this App looks like hanging somewhere: after a while it does not react on touch event - does not open weather app, also I've set to open Clock app when pressing minutes, but it stops opening. After I reboot my phone (OnePlus-7), this functionality starts to work again and stops to work after a few hours.",
      "This is the best weather app I've found. It has lots of options & allows me to easily navigate its features.",
      "The widget is supposed to be, in the three choices, 4x1, 4X2, 4X2. It takes up WAY more room than the actual size of the widget. So my home screen cannot be arranged satisfactorily. A whole row wasted. That is my sole reason for 2 stars.The space issue is so annoying that I may have to find something else. The weather/clock widgets that come on the Samsung Tab S6 are pitiful. That said, the appearance of the widget is very attractive especially after I chose the no background panel in settings."

      "An exceptional weather app ..I used to have Weather Underground and a few other ones and this now for me as of this posti is by far the best one! The app is very informative and I live in a rural area of Southern New Hampshire in Cheshire County and this is super accurate. Our weather here changes very quickly and it seems this app is very much right on top of it plus it gives me notifications of high winds as it did earlier today so I'm delighted with the app I think you will be too ..",
      "just downloaded so trying it out. so far so good. Been using it for over 6 months. I like the feature that I can add as many cities as I like to track. Lots of good info. Has worked well until now. I don't know what changed, but the temperature is wrong.",
      "Glad you have honed in the most on our temps. Most had our airport as our location and beingthat we are way up above that area, it affects our temps which varies greatly, from down in town. Thanks for not using our local airport for our temps. Your location for our weather temps is more accurate for us up here.",
      "Very easy to use and the most accurate weather app I've ever used. All the information I want is one page. With more detailed information easily accessible if I want it.",
      "Excellent Weather App! I've had them all in the past but this one gives you everything you need to plan for the day & the week ahead.No problems with my Maxx2 cell either."

I dont usually buy apps but, I actually needed a good weather app. So there you go....too bad a refund wouldnt be worth the effort, the app maker certainly doesnt deserve to get paid on this one! Delete",
      "This is the best app ever!!! First, I love the sound effects!! And second, I love the drawings and the background!! Download the app now trust me you'll love it! :)",
      "The app is fine, when the app says what the weather is going to be like some of the pictures aren't constant with the daily actual weather, and even when slight changes in the weather occur some picture/pictures again the same thing aren't constant with the daily actual weather and it doesn't even change when needed to the actual weather.",
      "This is a great app especially for me. I'm a Weather Watcher for a local news station. The only complaint I have is that the Weather XL Pro won't play on my home screen or locked screen. The Widgets work fine, just live weather part isn't working I even configured the app. Thank you."

And also the litter of puppies he just had!",
      "Makes me very happy to see the puppies everyday plus informed of the weather. The only feature I wish it had was a small list of stats (not necessary but helpful / fun ) I've seen on some weather apps - telling allergy index, if need umbrella, if good weather for running etc . But honestly id rather have puppies fetch my weather and I can figure that part out myself. (However, if the developers are reading this and want to add these or port them in from another app, would make this app even )"

      "Weather Live INCREDIBLE! The live maps,unlimited city list are great! Seeing how family weather is around the nation and the world! Plus ALL Weather alerts! EXCELLENT! And mobile so you can track where you are and where you're going LIVE! I hope they allow us to access our own private location to study and compare our higher elevation info. to the lower elevation info. around us.Every season r garden plants flowers and trees are always different n growth color and life from the lower elevation!",
      "I like the way the information is presented, but I do NOT like the fact that I can't get rid of the moving backround. I would prefer a solid color backround. I find the moving background distracting. UPDATE- turning off \"animation\" helps by setting a static background, which is much better than the same background in motion, at least to me.",
      "Why do I need to sign in to be able to utilize the full functionality of this app? Seems to me it's to share my info and I don't give my consent for that. \"Beautiful weather app\" or not, Granite offers a NOAA Weather (unofficial) app that you don't have to sign in/create account to be able to use all the parameters in their app. So glad play pass let me try this for free before buying!",
      "Great application, great support. I'm using Weather Live for quite a while, even way back when I used an Xperia phone. Accurate details, and very stable application. Love the widget, pretty informative, and besides, vey good supporting staff there at the back office. Get back to you ASAP and do their best to help out when needed. Thank you guys ❤️"

      "I have few thoughts on this free app: 1- The app does not rotate. My eyesight is bad, so I normally turn my phone or tablet \"landscape\" to increase the \"real estate\" to read. But this app is \"portrait\" mode only. 2- The app gives an 8 days forecast, and listed the percentage of each day's chance of rain. But when I checked for detail, such as what hour will rain the hardest, the percentages during the day do not match (or add up). This needs to be explained... Otherwise, it's good app to use",
      "Excellent weather app, the best one out there I have EVER found. Very accurate ,I will be sticking with this app no matter what!...Keep up the brilliant work guys. UPDATE: I doesn't find my location now, it always use to pinpoint me in my street, now just says current location. If I search for my area it will not find it. Downgrading to 3* until this is sorted",

I have family living in Nevada, Massachusetts, Colorado and Florida and appreciate so much being able to see the weather they are having with just a click on the icon❣ ...especially when there's dangerous winter storms, hurricanes or threatening fires happening. Peace of mind, interesting stories and great videos as well as up to date information when I need it. Weather Live!👏😊",
      "I use the English version, but there are many other languages available. I am amazed by the accuracy of the actual local weather. I also appreciate the abundance of videos. Very important for me: Humidity and dew point data. Not all weather services offer this. Just added I also dig the new design",
      "The Weather radar App has been extremely useful. I downloaded so I could keep tabs on Hurricane Dorian, and it has been a phenomenal app. So many resources, preparation information, variety of videos to watch, multiple ways I can get the same information (videos, articles, infographics), so I can find what suits me and my needs. The downside is that the advertisements usually have a louder volume than their own produced videos, which normally will make me delete an app, otherwise phenomenal."

      "This is my first time using this app. It's much better than the other weather radar app I've been using. Much more information on your weather app than the one that I always used before. I'm glad I have no problem checking out other sites and apps. Great job keep up doing what you do best. I'm in pressed and going to share with my Facebook friends.",
      "I just started using this app. Being a weather nut all of my life, I have to say when I first started getting weather on my computer it was wonderful since I never had cable tv, so my only weather was local tv or radio. Over the years I have tried many apps for weather and I can easily say that your creativity and hard work and knowledge on all that is weather certainly rates your app 5 stars and beyond. Thank you thank you, thank you! I love it!",
      "The longer I use Weather Radar (couple of months now), the better I like it. Nice graphics, just-the-basics weather & astronomical info (all I need) well-presented, no intrusive annoyances. (New aggressive ads forced me to uninstall the weather app i'd always liked, thus was sampling replacements.) I'm even starting to like the smallest WR widget, which I'd complained was too big. Will renew one request: I wish WR would render horizontally. (Thanks for your prompt response to my first rating.)",
      "Seems reliable. This app is one of the most useful weather forecasters I have come across and at the moment rate it as excellent for the times I have been using it. Love the precipitation radar especially.",
      "Its all fairly good, except the radar isnt showing anything, and were due to have severe weather around 2 pm. Which includes heavy rain, damaging winds, large hail, and possible tornadoes! So if ya need a 5 star rating then I need a reliable radar so I know whats coming. If you can address this problem, I would be happy to give you a 5 stars rating. Thanks"

It just gives me my daily weather report, in my location, and in any location you look for, at least I know of, in the USA. Not sure where else. Love cats and love to share it on my FB page to give our weather report in my area and also with his adorable little face to all my animal loving friends!🐱💝💝",

      "Nice app, but when I try to add widget to home screen, it wants me to enter a search for my city, but when I type, and enter nothing happens. Perhaps set it to use GPS to auto populate my location as search doesn't work. The same was when I first installed it and tried to add search manually, had to use my location, then after I had it I could add it. Even though it already put it 8n, but I prefer to set my home weather so don't need location on always.",
      "Good when it works, but it only works reliably when utilizing WiFi networks, as such it is kind of useless because it can't be trusted to work when needed, which is sad because it has the potential to be one of the best weather apps available, it's simple and easy to use, and it focuses on weather, not weather news, or climate change hyperbole, or ridiculous ads, just fix it so that it works reliably when utilizing cell data.",
      "On Windows this is a great app but Microsoft's android team have really let the side down here... No support for notifications, doesn't render correctly, even the hamburger menu can be seen off the left of the screenshots in the play store, constantly asks me to merge my account on startup.",
      "This app USED to be great (just like Windows). It seems pretty accurate and the maps are great. Lately though, when i go to use it I get a white screen and a search box and nothing happens. I have to force stop the app 3 and 4 times just to get it to load properly. Fix that bug and I'll fix my rating.",
      "Gives good info but it is frustrating that it doesn't have a refresh button (at least not that I can find one on my Android). When the app is opened the temp won't refresh and I have to close out the app and reopen it in order to see see the current temp change."

      "Video ads run and then freezes so no update Just installed update and the same problem..ad runs and then just freezes...done and done with this app. ABC has the worst overall coverage. They hire \"reporters \" that are barely out of high school. No wonder Scott Dennis left the station",
      "I like the app. The temperature is accurate and keeps up to date hour by hour. I've tried many other apps on Google Play. Does this app have an option to purchase to get an ad free version? The ads on this one are a bit much. They don't take over the functionality of the app, but they are pervasive taking up half the viewing screen. I would prefer to pay as much as $10.00 to get rid of all the ads because the app, as it is right now, is a good functioning app. So, is there an ad free version for sale?",
      "The timing of recent Tornado warnings and alarms gave us adequate time to take cover. Lightening warning and bolt were nearly simultaneous. Rain forecast for our area of North Port was spot on. 3 hours steady downpours.",
      "The weather map will not follow the address is, this app sucks",
      "I don't know if you do not cover Arcadia Florida as well as the rest of the areabut my main gripe is you guys are always off on the rain when it arrives if it arrives I usually get an alert after it is already rained at heavy precipitation is in my if you guys could get this correctyou would get 5 stars if you stayed accurate for a while"

      "Wonderful app with great UX! I would happily pay for an ad-free version. Also wish the widget header was less busy: it puts a meaningless hyper-local name at the top (the name of my local hospital!) instead of simply the city, town or village. I'd like to be able to switch off the display of the location name and date in the header as I generally know where I am and what day it is 🙂",
      "Just installed this app about an hour ago, and am happy to report that is great. I wanted to see the Sunrise and Sunset times clearly and this app does it very clear and on a per day basis too. I wanted to see hourly information per day and woohoo is there. I wanted at least 10 day forecast with daily hourly information and is there, kudos to all at Foreca for a well design app, it now matches the weather app by Microsoft oin my laptop, after all, Foreca provides the forecast, again thanks.",
      "You can also include snow maps & wind maps. The widget needs a better more modern design. I am talking about the weather symbols. Maybe a black and white combination available for the app and the widget. A severe weather alert might be useful as well. The time slider is not so useful they way map works after this update. It should be larger (easier to select and use).",
      "Fab app, I have found it very accurate and I love that it gives hour by hour forecast. There is an advert box at the bottom of the screen but it's not intrusive so I don't mind and it's a small inconvenience for a free app. Very happy.",
      "EXACTLY what I was looking for! Ads are minimal and NOT obtrusive. Accurate. Information is available without having to search and then be interrupted by an ad."

      "For some reason, the forecast on my local area is always wrong. For example now it says \"rain\" but the sky is blue and the sun is shining. I can count on one hand the number of times this app has provided me with reliable information. Feel like I paid for a pretty but useless interface. Edit: Thanks to developer for your clear reply! Hopefully more services will come in the future. Much appreciated you took the time to reply.",
      "Fantastic interface and awesome widgets. Just what I was looking for. Thank you! EDIT: After using the app for a few weeks, I've found my new favorite feature = the notification options. The one I found most useful are the \"Reports\" which send you a notification with a quick summary of today's weather first thing in the morning, as well as tomorrow's weather right before you go to bed. Love these quick, simple, and easy to understand notifications that definitely get me ready for the day. Upgraded to Pro subscription to support developer.",
      "I purchased a subscription to support the app since I really liked the nice clean UI. The current weather is typically spot on. That being said once there is any prediction required, especially in the immediate future this app does not perform. For instance, the app will tell me it is going to start raining in 15 minutes, but there is not a cloud in the sky. I might end up cancelling my subscription if this apps accuracy isn't improved. What good is a weather app if it can't predict the weather?",
      "With the latest update this is by far the best weather app I've ever used and I have used a lot over the years. Good job! 👍🏾 8/19/19....another great addition to this already fantastic weather app.. Radar. 10/15/19....with the regular updates this weather app continues to be the best out there IMO. Nice customization option available Nice and fluid. Update 1/21/20 city location doesn't automatically update anymore. 3/18/20...still loving this weather app... The best!",
      "Almost perfect but I had to cancel my subscription because I couldn't find a way to have widgets from two different locations. I commute so I was hoping to have different widgets for my home town and where I work. Beautiful wonderfully designed app and anyone that doesn't need this functionality should pull the trigger 100%"

      "I downloaded dozens of weather apps to find one that works for me. This is it. The information I need is right in front of me when I open the app. I don't have to scroll through pages of useless information. I don't have to scroll through an hourly forecast to add up the total amount of snow or rain we are getting from one storm. My only complaint is the status bar notification. I get a little cloud or icon to tell me the current conditions. I'd rather have the current temperature",
      "One of the better weather apps that makes use of screen space ok. Most apps have huge useless pictures and giant empty spaces on the screen. Holding radar hostage for a subscription is a pretty d-bag move though. I'll pay you $5 once but not on a subscription. Could you offer some customization? Let me choose to have the weekly forcast above the hourly? And why did you go horizontal for hourly and then vertical for the weekly forcast? Bad design choice there in my opinion.",
      "Excellent UI and display options as well as ability to select provider. The UI is keeping it quick and simple. A few more widget options would be nice but overall a responsive and accurate app. Nice job!",
      "Pretty fast load times -- much faster than my last weather app. Ad-free, un-cluttered, and intuitive interface. I wish I'd tried this app out a long time ago. Nice work!",
      "Super basic. Hourly forecast is only 16 hours a head. Very little data for upcoming days forecast. They curate info to what they feel is relevant but that means you need to use other weather apps to get more detailed info. Good radar and easy navigation but I do not recommend."

      "Great would love to give it a 5 star . The weather side is 5 star the ads are a 1 star. With the amount of people given there weather station info I don't get why there are so many ads I guess when u get bigger better there goes the keep it simple .",
      "Every time i tried to open it, I immediately got a page ONLY offering the option to set wallpaper, click on that I got a warning that setting live wallpaper will use more battery, but I never had any other option, it was like going down a one way dead end street, there was no where else to go, so I uninstalled it",
      "This is a stupid app It keeps pushing you to download the windy app just to look at the weather radar .Not worth my time",
      "Thank you very good app",
      "this App is amazing I live in a mobile home without a storm cellar and I am also handicapped when bad weather comes I sit and watch the radar and it is very comforting to know how accurate this App is thank you so much!"
