      "I wanted an app to monitor my weight and plot it on a graph as I think actually seeing a line going down, (or up!), motivates me more to stick to my new diet. This exceeded my expectations showing my BMI, works out my target weight, stats, history etc. in 3 easy to read screens. Just what I was looking for! Fantastic app! 5*",
      "Great App, keep it up. It would be nice if we could change the profile starting weight. My weight cycles up and down thrown the year and it works be nice to be able to set the starting point for the analytics as the current year not the entire logged history.",
      "Great app, gives an average on the graph as well as as charting weight loss on a downward graph. Wish it forecasted the weight lost on the graph over future time.....it does tell you the number of days till your goal weight though.",
      "Helps me hold myself accountable for my health by taking my medications on time, checking my blood sugar regularly, and motivates me to eat properly to reach a healthy weight. It is my accountability partner for self care!",
      "Awesome app. Have been using it for about 2 or 3 years now and it does everything it adversities. Would recommend to anyone one. First got it for when I was powerlifting, now I'm using it to keep track while I do some body building work."

      "This app is the best app ever and its only a couple of MB's too! I used it for 3 years now!!! Its the only app that helped me lose wieght and monitor it. Seeing the charts and progress helped motivate me. Other apps are just too \"noisy\" for me. They want to do everything and end up losing their identity. This app has been stable thoughtout these years. Always remained true to its purpose!",
      "The app has proved itself invaluable in my daily health plan to track my weight. It provides a nice, tight, minimalist record of my efforts to keep things under control. One can only imagine where the developer might take it should be choose to expand it into other health management areas! (Not so subtle a hint and words of encouragement!)",
      "My favorite weight tracking app. The graphs are helpful. I love that it shows you the current percentage of time that has passed between setting your goal/start date and your goal date and the current percentage of progress you've made through the goal you set. Helps keep me on track and know whether I've set an unreasonable goal or if I'm doing enough to actually meet the goal I planned and need to step my game up.",
      "It lets you know how much weight you have lost as well as how much more you have to go. It also provides a BMI check which is helpful. There's a graphical representation of the weight change and it's kinda motivating to see it keep going go down. Overall ots a good app with no glitches or anything nor does it consume a great deal of battery or space in your phone.",
      "This app is very comprehensive and easy to use. It allows for multiple profiles (I just have one for 2019, for 2020 etc to stop ths display becoming unmanageable) It provides a USEFUL graph - date gaps appear and are not compressed out - it's very configurable, allows goal setting/tracking, syncs well across devices and provides a host of info, BMI etc. It also seems to be Fitbit compatible (I don't have one). Would be 5* if the graph worked landscape too!"

      "I cannot believe I have signed up to pay money to use this app! I wish I could give it fewer than one star! I haven't been able to do the simplest tasks, such as adding a food to a listed meal, or changing quantities. The WORST part is that I find no help section for any guidance, which is why I am choosing to vent my frustration here publicly. This may just end my WW experience, since I chose it for its CONVENIENCE!! Ha, ha, ha!!",
      "I really had high hopes for this app! However activity-tracking is not as they stated! What application doesn't include the Android Samsung health! I will try it for the week but I think I would rather pay $39 for my Fitbit pal for the year! That application does the same thing and it takes into consideration activity for the day and we'll adjust your daily caloric needs. If you don't care about your activity-tracking and you just want to log your food this is a great application from what I can",
      "User interface is not intuitive. Have to use back button on phone too often to return to home screen. Database is random with no obvious way to search by category or in alphabetical order. Too many entries in database list foods in units of \"serving(s).\" Without a cross reference or recipe I don't know how much a serving should be. There are far better tracking apps (MyFitnessPal comes to mind.) but I have to use this one because none of the others calculate SP(As far as I can tell.).",
      "So frustrated with ww app as of late, it started off perfect but over these last couple of weeks it has taken so long to load up and then so long to do simple tasks on there. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, I've deleted other apps on my phone to see if it helps but nothing has worked. PLEASE sort it out weight watchers I'm not using the app every day because it takes so long.",
      "Had this app about 3 months. I've been using it with my Garmin smartwatch and I've been tracking my points and have been doing light gym workouts . I've lost 25.4 pounds so far and am juicing my way past difficult hurtles. This is a great app for tracking points and also how exercise has an effect on points. If you want something bad enough, you have to work for it."

A lot of the good features of course come on the paid version including being able to put in a goal weight which is a pretty simple feature that I think should be free but hey they have to make their money right",

Edit: I've added 20 records before purchasing the premium version. Do I have to add more to see the forecast? Second Edit: The app devs are prompt in response. Their app doesn't support weight gain goal forecast. That's the reason I was not able to see forecast date. So they quickly refunded the purchase amount. -1 star for not supporting gain.",

      "Please help! No matter what I do the app continues to change my starting weight. So while I lost weight this week it shows that I gained weight. I am not on premium because I really just need a simple food tracking app as I'm doing alternate day fasting. It's just a little discouraging to have the app showing me I gained weight when I lost weight. I changed it twice before I started as it kept somehow going back to a different starting weight. 30 pounds less than I am!",
      "Easy, not crowded with ads, connects to Strava if you pay. It is only $40 a YEAR. I havent upgraded yet, but thinking I will. I like the barcode scan option. Havent used the food photo yet. Has all I need. No pestering coach, but it does send a notification like once a day if it has been a while since you recorded. I like a little reminder, but not one ever hour as some apps seem to do. So far, I like the app. Much better than the other free one I tried.",
      "Very good app. I feel it is worth the price for premium. Previously I was using MyFitnessPal until the bugs just became too much. The one area that needs improvement is search. While it works most of the time there are enough times searching doesn't happen when inputting info. Latest example: cauliflower pizza returned chips, cookie, mashed potatoes, amazing greens, etc... This is version 12.1.700 (11037).",
      "Lose It! has been a great help in my progress to keep track of my food intake. The site offers good advice for health as well. There are many features which would take long to describe, and there's been the occasional crash of the app, which doesn't surprise me. But overall, Im very pleased with Lose It! I have tried to reach out to Lose It staff to ask questions not on the website. I'm a bit disappointed for no response. That said, Lose It! seems to be the best at what I need.",
      "This app used to be great, but not so much anymore. They've taken away standard features and only made them available in the premium upgrade. My Fitbit only syncs in premium now. I'm also really disappointed that you can no longer see all of your daily nutrition amounts, only fat, carbs and protein. You can no longer see sodium, sugars, fiber, etc. I've used this app for years, otherwise I'd look for another one."

      "The exercises are well described, with short videos if you require, and are \"easy\" to follow. The only accessories required is a floor mat and a chair. Intensity ramps up with time. Tracking of your progress is clear. It gave a decent result, yet no visible 6 packs... On the improvement side, the App is somehow a one time use only. If you want to redo some exercises after the first 30 days, you don't get the same follow up of your progress.",
      "I've been enjoying exercising to this app. The calendar keeps me motivated and accountable. I wish there was more to it after you complete the 30 days. This developer has a plethora of different apps revolving around fitness and if they consolidated them into one or few apps, it would've been very good. You could still charge per section within the app.",
      "Great Results, it allows you to achieve your ideal weight without much strain or excessive work that leaves you exhausted and to feel dead at the end of the day. Instead it gives you your own personalised training schedule and helps you to stay in line of your goals that way too, as an added benefit. All in all, a great app",
      "Didnt think this would work. But I thought , if I want give up 5 to 10 mins a day something is wrong. Started beginners now moved on to intermediate. People gave commented on my shape. I can now get back into my suit, instead of buying a new one. The app is customisable and tracks your progress. Personally I thi k its great fir people on the go or have limited time to work out. Give it a go folks, nothing to loose only weight and gain a new shape. Thanks",
      "I really like this app. I bought the app to do away with ads. I've used this app for two weeks, and I used the same company's ab workout app for a month, and I have lost five pounds (my goal is 15), and my core strength has improved considerably. I like how there are different levels of strenuousness. I've been on intermediate, and I think I'll go up another level in March. I like almost all the exercises, and for the few I don't like (like jumping jacks and sit-ups, I just sub in. Five stars!"

      "Good way to track weight with meaningful metrics, tracking reminders, nice encouraging words, ways to make it personal and a convenient export/import data feature via an excel document. I would like to see something more though, like maybe tracking the person's activity through the phone's sensors and advising behaviours to help meet the target weight, diet suggestions, workout suggestions and also automated, motivating workout notices based on the goals.",
      "Does what it says. Ads are annoying, but for the cost of a donut or two (which you should be skipping anyway if you are using this app) you can go premium. The export/import feature was a nice touch too, as I just upgraded phones and wasn't looking forward to reentering a bunch of data. 5/5",
      "This app do not have statistics what so ever , not even average weight. The only calculation done is BMI, and believe it or not, fat procentage. One wander how that's done. Withdrawing one star, render it with only one Three minutes after installation one is asked to take a stand about the app, and if one want to pay or continue receive a ton of ads. It ought to be a law against such conduct. I'll deal with it later",
      "I really like this app. Like how it tracks your body fat and BMI, also like how it has a graphs your weight. Vary easy to use and vary simple. I also like how you can customize the color. The only thing I don't like is when you put in the time you can't put in AM or PM. The clock goes from 1 to 23.",
      "I'm adding 4 stars because I am new user to this application and thank you for your wonderful effort. But I suggest and it will be more help if there is fasting tracker option to motivate users when supposed to eat and how many hours of fasting such Intermittent fasting, thank you and more power👍"

      "I can't change my photo, it still shows me 169 days streak and it's always crashing and freezing. I reinstalled the app - didn't help, so I deleted my account and created new one and I am still experiencing the same issues. In the past it didn't take so much data, but now it takes about 700MB monthly just because of some useless features. This app has been ruined down in the present. The simplier was the app the better it was. Please, give us back our old good MyFitnessPal. (1 year experience)",
      "My gym recommended this supposedly free app. All of a sudden, I'm charged 84.99. No notice, just automatically charged through Google Play. I filed a fraud claim with my bank, got a new debit card. Meanwhile, I'm still trying to cancel a subscription I never agreed to, however, I'm sent on a wild goose chase of links that never take me to a page where I can cancel or get a refund. Absolute bullsh#t",
      "The app is nice and helpful. I'm giving 3 stars because it's annoying that there are now large ads on the home page. This normally wouldn't bother me, however they are huge mugshot pictures. Not something I want to see everytime I open the app. I would hate to have to delete the app because I really do like it. If you can change this that would be great and I would be more than happy to leave a 5 star rating.",
      "The reliability of the app has totally fallen off recently. Don't even think about trying to use the barcode scanner... glitches out and shuts down the app every single time! Freezes and stops working right in the middle of trying to create a recipe so you have to keep trying again from scratch. Super annoying.",
      "Great app! I'm using it as a weight loss tool that gives me valuable information about my calorie intake, breakdowns in macro and micro and keeps me on track with my goals. I love it! Only reason I gave it a 4/5 is that it asks for a paid subscription to download the data and go deeper with analysis."

      "This is excellent in my opinion. Quick & simple to use & understand which is what I wanted. Allows you to back up records if you wish just in case which is a feature I like. Particularly like the displays with the markers for the BMI which tell you how far away you are from the healthy green zone. One small amendment I would suggest is to have an action start date so you could see the difference from that point when starting dieting & exercising rather than 1st weight log. Brilliant app though.",
      "I have downloaded a few of these apps over time and wasn't impressed with any, but I like this because it is simple. Giving you all you need without a lot of unnecessary graphs and information. You can track your BMI and you have a simple graph to see your weight loss progress.. it also lets you input your weight in stones and pounds too. So it's ideal for me.",
      "Great weight tracker. Easy UI & free. Easy to understand formats even with a gauge for how much you've got left until you reach a healthier category in BMI! Customisable measurements for height & weight displayed etc. Notes section too. Idea; It would be even better if you could enter body measurements to track too - I can use the notes section but it'd be nice to see the measurements displayed like the weight changes so you can see the improvements or where you need to get back on track.",
      "Simple. No fancy unnecessary stuff. No ads. No purchases required. No log on. No internet needed. No social - I'm a private person and psychology advice is don't share your goals with others! The key number shown is PERCENTAGE ACHIEVED which is a number that goes UP rather than down. Psychology advice is an INCREASING NUMBER is more motivational than a decreasing number. Obviously starting at 0% is a bit disconcerting but within days the number starts going up and up. Also notes area for diary.",
      "Easy to use and gives a clear and very helpful representation of both your progress to your target weight and how this fits in with BMI & weight range guidelines, all of the information you need can be read at a glance by scrolling through the 3 screens"

Please download it and give us feedback to help optimize the algorithm. \r\n\r\nThis estimator weight scale app works as a:\r\nWeight scale in grams:  With limits between 10 – 500 grams\r\nWeight scale in pounds: With limits between 0.022 – 1.1 lbs\r\nWeight scale in ounces: With limits between 0.352 – 17.64 oz\r\n\r\n Some extra tools findable in every house are needed in order to make it work: \r\n-\tA 0.5 Liter water bottle (filled with water) \r\n-\tTwo pieces of A4 paper (the ordinary white papers you use every day)\r\n\r\nThe 0.5-Liter bottle is used to calibrate the weight scale mobile app but in case you do not possess such a bottle, you can still calibrate with another object of your choice with a weight specified by you (find details on settings menu). \r\n\r\nThat’s all you need! \r\nWatch the short explanatory video where you will find the simple instructions you need to follow in order to start using the weight balance estimator as a digital scale weight grams, digital scale weight pounds or digital scale weight ounce. \r\nDownload our weight scale app to get the cell phone weight scale estimator. The instructions on how to use the free digital weight scale estimator as a kitchen weight scale can be found inside the app too but by watching the video you can get a better understanding. \r\n\r\nWe are reasonably confident that by following the instructions at your best you can lower the error to 10-15% of the object mass.\r\n\r\nYou can use this electronic scale balance app as a digital scale weight for your phone to estimate the weight for objects that do NOT exceed 500 gr /1.1 lb / 17.64 oz. If you try to put weights greater than that, the phone weight scale estimator will stop measuring.

      "After a long winter I really needed to get some exercise in my daily routine and this app is perfect. I'm doing the 30 days to lose belly fat but also have done bikini body. Great options to change things up once you've finished a program. It is not too intense for me getting back into the swing if things. Really great app and the ads aren't annoying which is a bonus.",
      "Its quite well as it analysises my progress and i feel satisfied as i am hitched to a goal for which i am motivated to work hard and achieve the necessary . The only problem i felt was the other workouts are available only if i watch the video it provides so it feels a little bit bad that i am pevented from exercising more if my internet connection is not so good and yes the buffering erases all my interest. I request the authorities to look into it and do the needful.otherwise , liked it.☺",
      "I'm honestly REALLY getting into shape and I'm only on day 7! I love how you dont have to have professional tools to train, not do you have to go to the gym. I workout every day, and I can see how it's impacting my lifestyle and health. I love this app😁",
      "One of the best fitness apps of all time. The instructions are clear and there are exercises available for all. The app also links videos to do certain exercises which is unusual to find in fitness apps. Additionally, the app also has a water tracker! I am very happy with this service.",
      "As a busy and arthritic person, I can say this is the best, most customisable app for exercise. Bad arthritis day? Low impact. No time? Wake up 10 mins early and do a short workout. Broke? These exercises use just your body, no equipment or gym needed. It's everything it advertises. Love it :)"

      "I've loved this app since the first day I used it. Perfect for me and it makes my weight loss/maintenance much more enjoyable. There's a lot of functions I find useful. Especially the panic button! That's saved me from ruining my day so many times... Thank you! Very wonderful app. So many features I never want to go without... Which is why I even opted for the paid version haha. I never do that, but tjis app is worth it. Seriously.",
      "I had this app on my old phone and lost over 20lbs. I stopped using it and gained it all back. Now I'm using it again and lost 8lbs already. This app is a fun and very helpful tool for food addicts like me. It makes me be accountable for what I'm eating and how much I'm exercising. I just wish you didn't have to start the app over, including $, when you switch phones. Overall a terrific app!",
      "Started off well but went down the drain pretty quickly - paid the £5 one off charge for extra features that I didn't get full access to. I've been trying to contact the development team since October about this,without any reply. Prior to paying, I contacted them to ask if the £5 charge was a one off payment and they replied straight away..The app is missing so much in terms of foods, exercises, and there is so much content that you can't access without paying - uninstalled now for a better app",
      "This app is not as fancy as others, it doesn't track protein or carbs when you make your food diary entries. But it definitely gets the job done. Honestly I would recommend this calorie counter app to anyone because it's so easy to navigate. And has features like the panic button, before and after pics that you can upload. if there is a food item that's not listed in their log you can type it in and also login the calories and amount that you consume and it will save. So far I have lost weight.",
      "Excellent! I used to go to slimming world and now that I have found My Diet Coach app, it is absolutely brilliant, it helps to motivate me and I love the fact that you have a panic button on the app if you have cravings, it is my first day today so fingers crossed it will help me lose weight 🤞"

      "Very cute and motivational app. I love it. Would be great if you could set multiple goals to reach over a longer period of time. For example, I know the weight I want to reach by the end of the year, but setting smaller goals in the meantime will help keep me positive and on track. If smaller goals were introduced, it would be nice if there was something else you got for succeeding, like in your other app where you unlock stories, but better stories please!",
      "Honestly my favorite weight tracking app that I've been using for years. Let's you record your weight, body fat % everyday and it creates a graph based off your weight over time. You can set goals as well as choose a cute sticker that represents your mood everyday.",
      "App is cute and useful. I like that there is a diary, chart and stikers for a good mood. Of the minuses, there is no automatic calkulator of the % of fat in the body. Each time you need to calculate and enter manualy. I would also like a function to enter body parameters.",
      "Very cute and tremendously helpful app. I've already lost 10ibs and I think a lot of it had to do with getting a good visual on my progress, and the overall gentle approach it had to your bad days / the excitement on your good ones.",
      "I'M SO SAD ;D; it deleted all my progress from last year! I was 163 at the beginning of last year and I'm 127 now and I was hoping to see the graph but everything got wiped, even diary entries. ):"

      "This is a great app! It is easy to use and follow. I loved all the aspects of the app; support from your personal coach, great recipes, log food and meals easy, step counter and much more. It really is the only app you would need. However, when the 14day trial is up it is a little expensive and remember that it is US funds. With our world in chaos it wasn't the right time for me to join for long term. This app really got me started to be accountable, so I found a free app to help me.",
      "Good program Overall the program is good. The user interface could use some improvements. 1) The user should be able to directly enter the numbers instead of having to scroll. Too slow 2) Entering multiple meals at once requires too many clicks. The whole process needs to be stream lined. 3) Noon has it own idea what a serving size is, which doesn't match the manufacturer serving size, so all the calories counts are off. Very frustrating. The coaching and education side of things is good.",
      "This app and program are working for me and I'm loving it. It's a balance of education, tracking food, group support, and it's all slowly delivered in daily lessons. I've lost 10 pounds in 4 weeks and the best part is that I'm learning how to eat healthy and make better decisions that I can carry forward after I reach my goal weight vs using some sort of crash diet and yo-yoing. There are some usability things in the app that I would love to see fixed, but it doesnt impact the program.",
      "So far, this program has worked better than others I've tried. They don't have prepackaged meals to buy, but lots of recipes so you can make what you like or try something new. They teach you how to understand your eating and work at making the changes to maintain the weight loss. Been on the app for 4 weeks and have lost 16 lbs. Best of all I'm viewing what I eat differently. No food is off limits, but limit when and how much is the plan. I can have cake, but maybe once a week.",
      "Account and subscription management is horrible. These things are not upfront and very difficult to change. If are taking part in the trial please note that you will be automatically put into a renewal program and be charged 106 dollars after the trial begins. There is no warning before this charge is made either. I ended up not using this program cause it wasn't for me, but the fact that account management is so tedious is a serious flaw in my opinion."

      "If you use all aspects of this program, you are destined to loose weight and inches to be a healthier person. The health checks really make you more aware of what is needed in your daily diet. This reminds me of the version of WW before they started taking good parts away in 2016. So glad I found this program and once again seeing the weight and inches decrease.",
      "Wow! The app is a free, but I highly recommend going Pro! There is so much more information and the recipes are fantastic. Join a weight loss forum you'd enjoy. Everyone is encouraging and willing to share their success and struggles and even a recipe or two. Highly recommend!!!",
      "I love itrack bites! I actually just cancelled my official WW subscription because I didn't like it as much. Overall itrack bites is more intuitive and user friendly, however, a couple of things I did like on the WW app that I'd love to see in itrack bites: • A separate button that quickly takes you to a 'zero point foods' list based on the plan you're on • The ability to track your daily steps as an activity Not on the WW app, but still waiting for Google Fit syncing capabilities!!",
      "I like this app except for the fact that I paid for the pro version to get the restaurant guide as part of this app. But I saw when using it it simply says 1 serving next to every item. It doesn't give u the choice of choosing 16 oz 24 oz 12 oz or how much of something say 1 hot dog or 1 burrito, simply says 1 serving without any explanation in what that serving is so my costco hit dog 1 serving at 19 points. Seems a little high for a hot dog with no bun. Any suggestions, if not can I get refun",
      "I've used this app for several years & several diet plans. I'm currently doing keto & it is helpful although I find that when I scan item, the results are mixed. Since this app has the ability to add my own foods, I just use that to enter corrected info. Overall a good, helpful app & worth the subscription fee."

      "Integrates poorly with my fitness pal despite having an integration option. Has synced with it in the past, but unfortunately not sure how to force a sync (have removed and added sync). Thus, I can't get a sync with my Garmin (because to sync with Garmin I have to go through my fitness pal, ugh) anyway, I love the scale. Had it for years. App is also very good. Integrations suck. Basically, you'll have to hand input your data, which isn't all that bad. Just beware its an issue.",
      "When it worked, it was great but now it's useless. I specifically wanted a scale that does everything this one does and keeps track of everything in one place. When I first got this, it was awesome. But now it's stopped pairing and nothing I try works. It's going to Goodwill because I'm passed the return window on it.",
      "I had trouble setting a new goal weight. I could enter the weight but it wouldn't save. I emailed the developer and he said to reduce the size of my font on my phone a Google Pixel 2 XL, it worked after making the font smaller I could see the save button for my goal weight change. Hopefully this info helps others that were having the same trouble.",
      "Blue tooth fails! I just bought the scale at the end of December. I have had the blue tooth fail on me 3 times. It isn't my phone since none of my other blue tooth devices have this issue. I had to uninstall & reinstall the app. The first 2 times it worked. This time it didn't. Waste of time & money!",
      "Used to work ok, but can no longer get the scale to pair at all. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting the phone, enabling and disabling Bluetooth on the phone, restarting and factory-resetting the scale, but it still refuses to pair. Just spins for a while until the scale gives up and shows E1. Using a Pixel 3a on Android 10, and I pair to other Bluetooth devices regularly without issue. Totally useless app now."

      "I have been using this app since September of 2018 and it has been a great, simple tracking tool. My only dislike is that I got a new phone just recently and I cannot import my past year plus of data to the new phone. If I could transfer that information I would gladly give 5 stars.",
      "Foreign data format only, not configurable. There is no way to set date format that you use in your country.   Update 06.01.2019:  1. I don't want to change language. I want to change date format.  2. Even for the same language there are different formats, e.g. in UK it differs from US.  3. Even for the same country there are different formats. E.g. in UK there are 2 formats that are used in most cases: dd/mm/yy and dddd-mm-yy. That's why any app that displays date MUST have date formatting option.",
      "The app is concise and simple to use. I especially like the function of showing how much you have to go to reach your goal weight. I only have 20 more pounds to go (yay). Knowing your BMI is also very helpful to understand how much you should lose to your healthy weight."

      "Excellent app! Love how it shows how much I've loss each week. Now I don't need to carry my weight loss book with me each week to group. I can track my journey on my phone 😊",
      "On the whole a good app, a couple of the visuals would benefit from a little tightening up and the st/lb scale needs an extra measurement digit as nearly all weighing scales now give their results in 1/4 lb increments and with the extra digit you would be able to record e.g. 10.25 instead of as now either 10.2 or 10.3. Enjoy using it though and the graphs do help you to keep on track.",
      "This is a useful app which enables me to track weight, basic measurements and set goals. Nice simple app to use and read.",
      "Brilliant app, been tracking my weight here for 2 years. Great to see weight graphically. Love the ability to add short term goals",
      "Does a good job of tracking. Takes a little time to figure out how it works but then it is straight forward."

      "This is a great app and I totally love it. I use it every day to count my steps. I just wish it would really count every single step. It is not really quite on the mark. If it was it would give me every single step that I take cuz I walk a lot.",
      "It's more helpful than I thought. I get feedback from the App about my performance every time I open it by the end of the day. It's able to show me the trend analysis of my performance. Kudos to you.",

      "Terrific app for calorie counting and diet analysis. Very nice UI. Multiple ways to navigate. Never gets in your way. The free version has a ton of bells and whistles and is stable a fast. I gave it 5 stars because just the free version is really good. I'm not a big fan of premium subscriptions. I'd rather buy it straight out. I want to give these developers money, but not monthly. Perhaps they would consider giving monthly premium membership for logging foods in the database. It's a bit light.",
      "App is very easy to use. I have been using it for only a few months to track my food, water, snacks, exercise, nutrition and weight. I really like the barcode feature, which makes it SO easy to log foods. Just create a quick profile and get started. I have even used the barcode to log foods and create personalized recipes. Highly recommend for someone wanting to lose weight or just stay fit.",
      "It's a great app and I'll still use it over the competition but there are a few huge problems. 1. It doesn't understand a single barcode I throw at it. 2. It doesn't support Unicode characters. I understand that it's mainly meant for US users and it's not a big deal to enter all the barcodes myself but not supporting Unicode is completely unacceptable in this day and age.",
      "Its super helpful, so far I've lost 2.8 lbs in 9 days so woo! Sometimes it's hard to get the right amount of food logged and it's not always practical to log in grams cuz I don't actually have time to weigh it out so I make a rough estimate. I love that it gives me little helpful tips and facts about my diet and I especially love that I don't feel like I'm on a diet, never hungry and honestly I'm feeling much more energized. Helps me make healthier food choices and I love it!",
      "It's an excellent app if you don't cheat and very flexible for adding custom foods. Well impressed! I lost a shed load of weight, safely, in a short time. I say safely because the app gives you a nutritional breakdown of what you do eat so that any deficiencies re proteins, vitamins etc are highlighted. Although I've met my target it's an app that will remain very useful in the future."

      "I bought the 1 yr plan and it has definitely helped me keep a better watch on my calories. I am seeing the results I want. HOWEVER, when you enter a food, it has a face that accompanies it- smiling or frowning. As someone wth disordered eating, I don't think the extra judgement is necessary. I've reached out to Lifesum and they said that this can't be changed, which is very disappointing. Overall it serves it purpose, but I would NOT pay for it again. Either use the free version or chronometer.",
      "Its keeping me on track. Logging meals, weight, water, exercise helps me stay the course! It syncs with my Sports Gear watch to log my steps or will use the phone. Very easy to use. Love the bar code scanner. It also has a list of foods I eat often. I do not have the premium just the basic and I am losing weight.",
      "Well, it's very cool that you can use it for so many things such as counting your calorie intake, tracking macros, adding activities and also learning some new recepies. It's pretty helpful having so many types of food, different brands and also possibility of adding your own food or scanning the QR code or barcode. I would suggest that controling macros is able in normal mode and not just if you have premium. This app motivates me to be healthier 😊💪🥦🍳!!!",
      "It wont allow me to sign in and says that \"there was a problem\" everytime I try to make an account. It also keeps asking me to check my internet connection however my internet connection is just fine and works well on every other app. Used to love this app .... not sure why it's acting so screwy :( I'm disappointed Edit: It STILL won't allow me to even log in .....",
      "A very easy-to-use, pleasing-to-the-eyes health tracker. The foods and exercises are easy and effortless to track, it tracks and shows your macros as well and the databanks for different products seem very complete. The only complaint I have is you can't change the size of the water glass the app tracks, it's either a 250ml glass or 500ml bottle. My glasses are closer to 200ml and bottles I use are 875ml ones. This makes tracking water intake accurately kinda cumbersome for people like me."

      "We can press the arrow to go to the previous set if it is a bit faster than our workout. Things are easy to control. Time and efforts continue to count. Great. 26 Feb 2020 It'd be perfect if the trainer speaks little slowly. People who aren't regular trainees can't finish the set within that amount of time. Quality should outweigh, right? Rush to catch up ruins the joy. 24 Feb 2020",
      "I thought this app would be stupid like most of the others but actually its a GREAT app. You actually lose wait its not hard for beginners but slowly and shortly it gets harder. One thing i also love about the app is i didn't know that i was losing weight till i stepped back on the scale and iost 23 pounds. I truly think you should go and downlaod this app! And thanks to whoever made this app.!",
      "It seems good so far (first day) however i cant set the reminder. I've tried multiple times--a button is missing or hidden. Also it says i weigh nearly 400 pounds on the graphic even though ive entered my weight and height over and over. And as others have complained it keeps resetting to 68 inches (but since i'm close to that i guess that's a minor issue). I do really like it so far. I would give it 5 stars if the info and reminder portion worked properly.",
      "I added my height and weight for my profile. I go to see what information it has and says I weigh 200 pounds more than I do, when I go to edit weight it has the correct weight. I changed my weight to see if it would change on the graph, it still had an additional 200 pounds. I changed my weight back to the correct weight and now the BMI has changed and is incorrect. This is a nice app but I wish my personal information would be correct.",
      "I would give more stars but it won't let me put in my correct hieght today. It will keep on saying 60 to 62 inches when im really 57 inches tall. Also I put in my correct weight and its still correct when I go to see the actual number but on the graph it will say that I'm 350 to 400 and no! I'm only 170. Please fix this... I want to keep using this cause it's so simple but i want to be able to track my weight on here and everything. And I'm 22 years old so I'm not going to grow much taller."

    "title":"Body Measurement, Body Fat and Weight Loss Tracker",
    "description":"Body Measurement Tracker allows you to track and chart all of your most important body measurements including weight, waist, hips, thighs, biceps, body fat percentage and Body Mass Index (BMI). You can also track any custom body measurements you can think of (shoulders, skeletal muscle %, body water % etc.) on your mobile device.  What’s more, you can instantly chart the changes in your body stats over time, and your data is automatically synced to the cloud.  All you have to do is login with your Google Account or email address.  \r\n\r\nThe app also includes a built-in body fat calculator and will calculate lean body mass, body fat mass, waist-to-hips ratio and daily caloric needs as well.  \r\n\r\nIf weight loss is your goal, it is important to monitor not only what and how much you eat, but also your weight and other indicators of health such as body fat percentage, waist, hips etc. Since body weight can fluctuate up to 5 lbs (2.3kg) per day, it is important to weigh yourself on a regular basis and at a consistent time every day.  This way, by looking at your body measurement chart, you will be able to assess your weight loss trend over time.  Some digital scales provide an estimate of body fat percentage, which you can save within Body Measurement Tracker to determine whether your weight loss is a result of a desirable loss in body fat.  Alternatively, by measuring waist, neck, height and hip circumferences the app’s body fat calculator will automatically calculate body fat and lean mass percentages and chart them over time.  If your lean body mass is calculated successfully, the app will also estimate your daily caloric need based on your stated activity level and sex.  This information may provide guidance to diet modification to further enhance weight loss and improvements to body composition.  \r\n\r\nBody Measurement Tracker is customizable allowing you to track any body measurement you can think of and ignore the ones you are not interested in.  The following measurements are included by default:\r\n\r\n- Waist\r\n- Weight\r\n- Hips\r\n- Body Fat Percentage\r\n- Body Mass Index (BMI)\r\n- Chest\r\n- Upper Arms (biceps and triceps)\r\n- Lower Arms (forearms)\r\n- Upper Legs (thighs/quads and hamstrings)\r\n- Lower Legs (calves)\r\n- Height\r\n\r\nBody Progress Photos\r\nKeep tabs of how you look over time by taking an unlimited number of pictures of your body.  Just like the rest of your data, your body progress photos are automatically synced so they can be viewed across devices, so you never have to worry about losing them ever again.\r\n\r\nCALCULATED BODY STATS\r\nThe following body stats are automatically calculated, provided you have been tracking the required measurements:\r\nBody Mass Index (BMI) - The BMI is the ratio of body mass to the square of the body height and is a very commonly used index to categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese.  Overweight and obese individuals are at greater risk for coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke and more.  While the BMI is commonly used, it suffers from several limitations, not the least of which is that it does not account for variation in individual physical characteristics.\r\nBody Fat Percentage - The body fat percentage is the total weight of fat divided by the total body weight.  It can be estimated many ways, but since the body fat calculator relies on the measurement of height, weight and body circumferences, the Navy Method for body fat estimation is used.  This method relies on waist, neck and height measurements for males and waist, neck, height and hip measurements for females.  \r\nWaist to Hips Ratio - The waist to hips ratio is a useful indicator of overall health and the risk of developing serious health conditions. \r\n\r\nIcons made by Kiranshastry from  www.flaticon.com",

      "It's not the most beautiful and the ads are frequent enough to be annoying but this Body Measurement app has a good, simple interface that makes it easy to enter your measurements and helps set and track goals. Not bad for a free app and has exactly the functionality I was looking for.",
      "Was a great app until this last update. Every time I try to open it all it shows is a picture of the icon. I can no longer access my measurements that I've been tracking for over a year. I should've backed up my data on paper. If I were you I'd not trust this app",
      "It is not user friendly at all. It's hard to find where you have to insert your measurements. It has many abilities but it is so hard to use that makes it useless. In one sentence it's very good in the inside but terrible in the outside.",
      "Very good app to monitor the measurements. Different from other apps, this one will accept the measurements that you take even if you cannot check your weight.",
      "Straightforward and useful. Nice tool to keep track of improvements or setbacks whether you're trying to lose or gain."
