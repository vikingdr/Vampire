      "One of the worst enterprise software solutions I have come across in my life. Almost every week or sometimes 2 - 3 times a week it gives a message saying \"ADAL Token\" expired - you then need to uninstall the app & re-install it - needless to say everytime with new passwords. Utterly frustrating & time wasting app.",
      "Barely functional work app. Requires authentication every 15 minutes or less, and unless you're in that period of authorization, you won't get notifications of meetings or emails. It shows inexplicably wrong information regarding how many unread emails I have and half the time stalls indefinitely upon launch and has to be restarted. If any companies are listening, do not use this software!",
      "They application theme doesnt work at all. I'm using Samsung S7. I want to use light mode but every now and then it turned automatically to black mode, while in black mode I cannot compose new messages because I'm using custom font color (dark blue) and when in black mode the fonts impossible to read. Pls help to fix the bug.",
      "Authentication frequently spins forever, and the only solution seems to be closing the app and waiting an unspecified amount of time for the issue to resolve, making the app effectively unusable. This has been happening for about 3 weeks (that I've noticed) so far. Force stopping the app and clearing the cache doesn't seem to make a difference, nor does rebooting the device, though that would be an unacceptable workaround anyways.",
      "Horrible experience trying to use this app on my galaxy s10. I cannot ever log in, the app just clocks forever, so eventually have to reinstall leading to multiple attempts to configure/log in for the first time, and hours or days later when it finally works, I am only able to log in one time before I have the same problem with logging in again and restart the cycle."

      "The app itself has worked pretty sufficiently. But Steady is an awesome concept. I have already received $50 in gift cards from \"Income Boosters\" and it has encouraged me to start doing food deliveries. I'd say the only downfall, though very small, is that they can change the amount you're rewarded at anytime, even if you're in the middle of completing a booster task. But other than that, I've had no problems with the app and they reward exactly as promised. Pretty large amounts might I add. :)",
      "The boosters are awesome! They pay them the 1st and 15th of each month, so you may not receive them immediately, but they add up. Not the most effective for finding a full time position, (WHICH I'm still on the hunt for) but it's a lovely app to make some cash on the side. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get some extra cash, as it is a lot more effective than filling out surveys online",
      "I have had the best experience using this app! I received a $40 Visa card in my email from Steady as soon as I completed my 1st Instacart shop. I actually had completely forgotten about the Income Booster & it was such a great surprise!!! Thank you so much Steady!!! I recommend this app to everyone, it's awesome!!!",
      "Ok listing of leads and side gigs, but nothing new or that you don't get from a quick Google search. Don't waste your time with the 'Income Boosters', they always find a way around paying. A test with 4 different users tried 2 boosters each and none were paid, for various obscure reasons. Users stuck with consequences/memberships/accounts.",
      "As an app to help identify new opportunities this is well done. However I fail to see why my banking sign in credentials are required to complete setup. Routing and account number to set up direct deposit, hey no problem. But I'll be damned if I'm handing over access to my money to anyone."

      "I have the free version of the app and I use it for a student job. I need to record my hours to submit a monthly report. With the widget of this app, this has become very easy to do! It's a clean design, very funtional and intuitive. I transfer the data by hand however, as I did not buy the pro version. What I appreciate a lot is that you can tell the app how precisely the hours should get reportet, e.g. I choose +/- 15min.",
      "Works so far. I noticed that back on 1/14/20 someone made a feature request to be able to select which job she is clocking into and you responded that it was on top of your list, however that app hasn't received an update since November. I don't mind purchasing an app, but not if the dev is slow with updates.",
      "***update*** I was able to get the program to figure out the holiday pay with help from the company but it still doesn't calculate the overtime correctly. For me that's not a big issue cause I can do the calculation manually. That is why I only rated it a 4. Other than that it's a great program to help me keep track of my hours and pay. Thank you. It doesn't figure the hours correctly Tried to enter my holiday pay and it makes no sense as to how it calculates",
      "I stuck with it for a month, I even bought pro. The User Interface just seemed to lack, for a paid app. My biggest grip is when I Punch In or Punch Out, I can't see what Job i'm currently in, I ways had to go back and fix my hours. It's not until you punch out that it lets you select what Job you want to work for. Grip #2: When I go to view my shifts, the table is too wide for my Samsung Galaxy S10. So I would swipe to see the rest of the data, I would constantly swipe to the next week and lose my spot. I had finally moved on to another time card app.",
      "To the person complaining about having to manually enter their unpaid breaks, you can set up an auto break command, and it will automatically subtract whatever time you enter. You can find this in your settings, at the bottom of your settings menu. Thank you developer for this app. I've been using it for a long time now. Probably since you first published it."

The in app pop ups cover up buttons, so you have to wait for the unneeded popups to go away to clock-in/out for instance.

You guys need to fix it I'm sick of having to wait for a code and entering that code on the app everytime I log in!",

It's telling me it doesn't recognize my user name or password but doesn't provide any means or instructions to recover it. Everybody I speak to in my hr department tells me how much they hate the system when I call for assistance. If you're thinking of getting workday for your company do yourself a favor and don't."

Now companies are abusing this new feature by accepting contractors and canceling the job when they get a lower bids from other contractors in order to pay the lowest and now the typical job is going to be around $7.50 an hr. I for one have had 2 jobs get canceled this week after being accepted and they were reposted to be filled immediately with everyone bidding almost $30 less.",
      "Need extra work on the side, well here ya go! Just stay active on the app taking jobs and it works great. But if you take a break from using the app it's nearly impossible to get accepted for jobs. I was to busy with my regular job that I didn't have time for extra work here so I took a break for a few months and now NO companys on here will accept my bid.",
      "Love the concept. Gigs and temp work pay my full time bills... Great idea and all... But ive been using the app for a year and a half and never gotten paid. And now you can actually bid, like lower...? Sux to see it things go backwards instead of making forward progress",
      "Great app to make some part time cash or fulltime oppurtunities as well.",
      "I think the app is great for people who are able to do physical labor type jobs assembly work. I haven't secured a position yet through this app but I have referred this app too many people who I think could do the type of work that shows up in this app."

      "Originally used to fleetmatics work app. Changed over to the work mobile app and have been much happier with the functionality. I only have one problem. We take care of clients that have multiple sites. When a dispatch is sent out to the mobile user for a client at a particular site it only shows the client name it does not show the site name. Developers must have overlooked. For example to take care of a school district. And each school has its own name. Please fix.....",

      "It looks better than the Classic but is shocking to use. Issue with Start & Finish questions not showing. Verizon's answer - use the Classic until it's fixed. Now been an issue for over 2 weeks, unsolved and no-one has reverted back to me despite requesting our account manager contact me. It was rolled out as the next best thing and that all should migrate to it. Clearly no-one bothered decent beta testing properly.  Seriously, don't bother downloading this app if you want your field ops to be able to do their jobs properly.",
      "Update: I have now been experiencing several new glitches. The app crashes daily on me and makes me lose a large majority of my information that I have to reenter by memory. When I contacted Verizon connect all Verizon support staff could tell me is that my phone is the issue and not the app itself. All of my coworkers seem to have different problems. If I didn't have to use this app for my work I wouldn't touch it with a 10-ft pool. Verizon needs to fix their app. Crashes DAILY"

It also shows me that the work order or message linked from an email does not exist. Once I was able to reload, and the work order was available.",

      "To all of those having issues on Android 10.... There's been some kind of change for how the MDM works with Android Enterprise. If you're using a fully work managed device, you need to factory reset the phone, and set it back up again using the QR code set up, which your company should be able to provide for you. This fixed my Pixel 4 XL. HOWEVER, I don't think it will give you an opportunity to restore from a Google backup... at least it didn't for me, but my company doesn't use G Suite.",
      "Not compatible w/Pixel Droid 10. They claim to be compatible and stay up to date but I have been waiting for to be able to install the new operating system update to my Pixel since it came out. So much for supporting the one operating system that has Droid native to it. My phone has been without the latest security ever since the new operating system update came out. They are unresponsive and do not take this serious. All they care about is iPhone. 3/10/2020 Still no progress or eta for PIXEL!!",
      "Worst product ever. The connection is always in error. There is zero support! Companies make people use it and it doesn't work. I have to uninstall and re install every couple of months and my email is out for days in the process. Drains your battery and is a complete waste.",
      "The secure environment works well on a Samsung S9+ with Android 10 installed. I've had no problems with MobileIron/Mobile@Work since day 1 (at least as far as app use and sync is concerned). A few hiccups, but none noteworthy and all cleared up relatively fast. Company techs configured secure calendar, contacts, google web browser, mail, file sync, play store, and tasks. All work well for me. On my S9+, if I don't want to be bothered by work notifications, I turn off the work profile -- good to go. My biggest issue just arose. I don't know if it's Android 10, Samsung, Mobile@Work, or internal tech; but, when in Mobile@Work (e.g., Mail), I can't select gboard as the default keyboard. Samsung keyboard is the only option. Gboard is available outside the secure environment. I get that Google collects your info/might not be all that secure in the long run. You think your default keyboard doesn't/is? I need the option to select gboard in the Mobile@Work environment so I can use google assistant for hands-free typing. TBH, I simply don't like Samsung keyboard. Please re-enable gboard in Mobile@Work.",
      "Totally useless if your using Android 10. Keeps popping up every second with Secure Apps manager has stopped working. Can't use the phone and only way out is to factory reset. Can't even uninstall it. When is a fix coming out? Very poor service considering when Android 10 was released."

      "Great app, keeps track of your pay amt. as well as your hours, say if u go in at 7am & get off at 4pm daily u can do all your hours for the week at the beginning if you want. If u end up getting off earlier you can definately change it later. They have a free version or a paid one, the paid one will keep popping up asking you to pay, hit the back button to continue using the free version. I love it its definatly helpful, they have the option to manually enter or hit button to log in &out.",
      "This app has saved me so much money it's not even a joke. I work as a plumbing contractor for my pops company and before I found this app we were always getting into arguments come payday about my hours. Thanks to this app not only does it keep track of my hours but also keeps track of what job I'm on and how long I'm at each job. It's also a nice little extra seeing how much money I'm making each day so I know what to expect come payday. Great app and would recommend to anyone in the same boat.",
      "I love the app. I like the suggestion about double taps or something to prevent accidental punches. I hate the auto tracking. Would love to see an improved importing into Excel so that I can make totals easier. For example, I don't know an easy way to total the hours worked without manually going in and changing the value to a number. And maybe add web access.",
      "I love it! There is only one problem and that is it adds on a random day from a previous week or month so have to be careful not to add it into your time for that pay period. Although its not calculated, it's weird that its randomly on a current pay week or period.",
      "I absolutely love this app. It's super simple to use and extremely helpful for someone that works independently. I'm a nanny and it's really nice to just put my hours on here and have it calculate it all for me then let me send a report to the family I work for instead of sitting down and having to figure it all out and hoping there's no errors. I would highly recommend!! 10/10"

I no longer have for pissing everybody off because I can not unlinked them . no customer service. No phone number. my clients are all linked and getting more pissed off by the minute. Now they want me to loose their #. I cant unlink!",

      "Office is awesome. The subscription model is a bit of a deal breaker. I can't stand reoccurring payment plans and my plan is apparently going to end. So if office Uninstalls itself I'm switching to Linux. You buy a computer that works for a year then stops being functional is ridiculous. It feels condescending. You're company has billions in profit and I can't just buy the software and move on. I love your software and I hate your payment plans. But what do you care? You don't.",
      "I hate to complain, because it might just be the best Word Processing app out there. But, there are innumerable problems with the interface - especially manipulating/dragging the cursor for editing. Also there are periodic discrepancies in template formatting, indentions, margins and paragraph spacing. All in all though, it gets the job done. And, as I said, it probably is the best mobile word processor out there. I'm sure that with time and updating the devs will get all of that fixed.",
      "Wonderful!!! It's more than wonderful this software has been a dream of mine for over twenty years I was first using Microsoft 98 word and word weaver. I think that was the name of the product that I had used. in my office supply and tool store. It was a really a good product back then. It really promoted my thoughts and ideas into a reality. Thank You. Office 365 is where it's at \" a good product \"",
      "This app seems to do most of what a desktop version of Word does. The trick is to figuring out what all of the little icons mean to do what you need to do. For example, you can convert a table to text, but it took me a while to figure out that there was a conversion *arrow* that looks similar to a \"back\" arrow (or *undo* arrow) that was actually the convert icon. I don't know if that example made sense, but the point is that you can do a lot with this if you're willing to figure it out.",
      "Not full-fledged like the Windows version, but good for the Android platform, well tailored to touch-screen interaction and a works well with mouse and keyboard on a tablet. You'll miss some features and sometimes find that annoying, but overall, it's probably the best word processing app you can get for your phone or tablet."

I believe I was locked out of the original Gmail account connected to the blue crew account. But they still send a confirmation email which doesn't make any sense.",

      "Excellent app that gives you good paying temporary jobs on a daily basis that pays within 2-3 days, they can lead to great long term job/s from various companies. Not forgetting it pushes job notification as soon as they becomes available. I have been using it for over a month now and It's great.",
      "Love this app. They truly help if you're in a bind and need extra money, or in between jobs, heck you can even work full time from the app if you want to. They pay out 3 days after job is completed. My only negative is that do not have a number to contact for support, but the support group that you email generally gets back to you within 48 hours. I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking for work. And with the badge tier they also grant benefits to those who have worked long term!!",
      "The only time I get alerts is when my location is off that upsets me the most and then when you click on it it's gone. I turn my location on and I get no alerts for hours at a time and when I finally get one it's not available anymore. I put the times I was available and I get alerts for times I can't work or for places way too far to drive (like other states)",
      "So far it's pretty crappy. Can't update location. Can't enter bank information. Can't enter ssn to be able to enter bank information. Can't complete onboarding process because - according to the app - there's nothing available in my location - which is BS becausr their own map says otherwise. Plus a friend who lives in the same area uses the app and referred me because of the available work in the area. Can't find information to contact support. BS app so far.",
      "Horrible app support team service. A (lady) team member of the support team for this wonolo app texted me a \"😘\" randomly out of no where after talking about my hours and work. I sent screenshots of conversation to support team and the next day(today) someone else from the support team texted me thinking that that is ok. I feel very uncomfortable with using this app any further until further notice from sexual harassment situation. Thank you, I'm done."

      "I like the app so far. Still getting to know the app, but forced to rate each time opening the app before having a reasonable chance to have an opinion and after paying for premium version. *Rating Update* *Even though I've rated the app, it still randomly prompts me to give it a 5 star rating. It's a bit annoying after already paying $11. 99 for the app. *Don't think that you get every function after paying your original $11.99. You still have to pay other $11.99 for unlimited invoices.",
      "Thank you for the fix! I had a problem with my phone and needed to reinstall the app without losing data. I contacted the developer and they were very quick to respond and created an update to enable me to update the install. It worked great! I really like the app and have been using it for several years. It is easy to create projects, add and adjust missed time, and track status.",
      "This is a wonderful app. It's the best time card app I have found super easy to punch in and out, modifying the time card hours for example you forget to clock out it is super easy to change it. You can set your rate, multiple clients, overtime, invoices are super easy to make, and even miles if you have to drive somewhere. The full version of the app is a little expensive, 10$ but it is totally worth it if you have to keep track of your own hours.",
      "Great app for keeping track of time and related data. I like the option of dding expenses directly to make invoicing easier. I would like the option of adding planned tasks for a period at 'punch in' rather than 'punch out'.",
      "I am a case manager and have over 50 clients. This app helps me to clock in and out and saves names of all clients. Better than my old notebook I used until I found this app. Thanks"

      "Was great until a few days ago. Now it makes me re sign in everytime I open it. Sign in again to apply. My original searches were gone. Still has my resume fortunately but it sure has lost a lot of its convenience. Update 3/18 The app quit on me while I was updating resume in the middle of applying for an internship. Now I get to start over. Correction, app has seemed to crash and will not open anymore. Yay.",
      "It used to work, at least somewhat, but since the last update I haven't been able to clear irrelevant jobs. It's never kept my extra search settings, so I have to keep redoing them every time. And even then, the filter is terrible; when I specify \"exact location only\" and jobs in English, it still gives me ones in French, and ones that require I relocate out to Alberta, Yellowknife, or even AUSTRALIA. And there is also no apparent screening of employers, given how many are thinly veiled scams.",
      "The assessments that are on this app can be asked and taken multiple times once on the PC and then another time on this app which can be problematic because sometimes phones aren't as clearly visible as on the PC having to zoom in and out of the application can be problematic when answering said assessment tests why not just sync up the account so you don't have to retake a test that you already have listed as ??? preventing someone from getting a job they would possibly would have???!",
      "I've had some really good luck finding jobs with indeed it's super easy to use it doesn't overwhelm your phone and you usually get a response from the employer within 24 hours or less. It's real easy to edit your resume and just use the resume you set up on the indeed app. I usually only apply to jobs that use that feature on the app that makes it way easier!!💪",
      "The app has been helpful most of he last few years. But over the last few weeks, everything has fallen apart. Indeed signs me out regularly, right in the middle of me applying. It also deletes my recent searches and settings. I have been very vocal about recommending this app, but it is now causing me so many problems that the only reason I ever used it in the first place (user friendly interface, ease of one click apply, etc.) is going to be why I uninstall. I love Indeed. Please fix this."

      "I love this app. It's very user friendly and easy to navigate. I like that you can customize and track your pay periods. The GPS/location clock in/ out capability is a major bonus- especially for someone like me who forgets. I initially started using the free version and after 2 weeks (which I believe is how many entries you can input with that version), realized it was going to be something I'd need/ use and bought the full version. Highly reccomend!",
      "Overall great tool for managing your hours worked between several different jobs. Provides several options for adjusting overtime pay rate, and inputting no-taxable items like Meal Perdium. My only complaint would be that I seem to be unable to calculate hours worked in a week collectively amongst several different jobs, for the purposes of calculating overtime pay this app will only give you the overtime PER job.",
      "Love this App, I've been using it for over a year now, it helps me keeping track of my hours worked. There's only one thing I reckon it's missing, I would love to be able to set a Weekend rate for every job I have in my account... I still need to manually change the pay rate every time I finish work on Saturday/Sunday. Hopefully dev can do something about it at some point :)",
      "Love the app for all it does. I can keep track of different jobs in the same week, as I'm working them (at different rates). The \"drag down on the the green bar\" to edit or add filters does not work on my Galaxy 9+ though. Still highly recommended!",
      "I use this app to track the hours I spend working on different projects and it has made the process so much simpler. The ability to make adjustments, pause and add breaks and comments all help me keep my timesheet accurate for my own sake and the sake of my clients."

      "If possible, would be nice if it can compute the wage/salary based on weekly, fortnight or monthly. Also, when using special characters on the \"Note\" section, its not showing up, specifically the \"and\" special character.",
      "So easy to use and makes it clear for you to see your schedule. Especially being able to change the colours, names etc. Love it!",
      "Great app. Can see what days I'm working months ahead, once I had put my work rota in. Fast response from friendly makers to for help and info. Well worth having 👍😁",
      "I purchased the Full version. I am doing freelance so each day is booked for different companies thus timings, rates, breaks, booking agent differ - it is impossible to remember all these. With this app it is easy to edit and arrange different shifts and notes for each of them. I make use of \"connect with another account\" so that my partner will be notified of any changes to my plans then & there (this function is just basic -pls develop it as a phone notification when other account update)",
      "Love the ease of updating shifts on this app. In previous apps, I had to tap to cycle through the different shifts on each day until I got to the one I needed. With this, I simply select the shift and tap the day to add. The only thing I am struggling with is setting a pattern. My husband has a 96 week perpetual roster, which has just changed from the previous roster. I added the amended 96 weeks manually, then tried to select the pattern from the day it starts to the day it repeats, but it's not working. It seems to be overlaying the previous roster from 2019-2020 to these dates, instead of using the 2020-2021 roster. Not sure if it's a glitch or I'm doing something wrong (I'm also having problems with my keyboard not showing up if I need to change shift names). That said, I'm incredibly impressed with this app. UPDATE: Thanks for the quick feedback on my questions. All my questions answered with viable solutions."

      "Has the best wiget! So far I have been using this for a month, it's been pretty good at a glance on my home page... Easy to apply as an appointment scheduling and shifts. Pretty happy, some things I would like improved, but overall it has met my expectations from the description.",
      "I bought the pro version so I can sync it to Google calendar. Now my wife can see my work schedule. It took me maybe 15 minutes to set up a custom calendar for the year, I tried using Google calendar and it was a nightmare. Love the app! Thanks for all your hardwork. I'll use this as long as I can.",
      "Despite giving access to all the requested permissions, the alarm still doesn't activate; in some cases the alarm will activate for 2 seconds before disabling itself. Seeing as how I use this app as a wake up alarm for work, this feature is crucial and necessary for my continued use. Been late to work 3 times recently due to the alarm not activating or continuing to sound off until I disable it.",
      "This app is excellent and working again now I have updated my Android OS with the latest software update. Excellent for allowing easy editing of shifts and the paint feature is excellent.",

      "9/4/19 Developer provided additional information. I was unaware all listings were remote as they were not when I first reviewed the app. We can now search for type but filters would be optimal to sort through variables. Developer, please add instructions for user. Also, expand your reach on the net to include more jobs. A quick search on the net yielded 3000 remote positions at Indeed. Thank you for the communication.",

They are constantly making changes to better address user suggestions for improvement.",

      "This app has great potential but it lacks features which would increase usability. For instance you need to create each day individually always selecting the hour and minute. There should be an easy way to duplicate a previous day or even duplicate an entire week or pay period. Most people work the same 40 hour week and having to individually populate a day makes this app a hassle to use. Would be nice to see this feature added in the future. Besides this the app is clean and easy to use.",
      "This so the only app I could find that calculates overtime correctly. The only thing I would ask for is to allow for different wages. If you work two jobs or work at two different locations that pay differently this feature would have to be added so that you could track everything. Otherwise a great app and definitely worth the price to upgrade to pro! I'll edit this review and give it five stars when we get the option to allow different wages.",
      "I recently changed my device and my pro plan is not activated even though I am under the same Google account. It is unacceptable to request re-purchase in this case. Please fix this and advise me accordingly. Thank you.",
      "Just what I needed... however additional deductions of $ value should be included like national insurance and health surcharge are flat rates which are deducted from pay... those should be included with the percentage tax deduction... but great app, thanks!",
      "A great app to keep track of the hours at work. It also acts like a diary, reviewing the type of work done on that certain time. Thumbs up to engineer of this app...thanks alot."

SINGLE. TIME. the app updates. PLEASE fix it so I'll I have to do is log back in, every app on the planet has this feature so it can't be that difficult.",
      "I've been using this app for the last couple yrs or so and up until today (12-15-19) it had been working great. When i got on it today, it said i was new to the app and had to register with my store's code...don't remember it and when i did try a code, nothing. It's still trying to load. Very frustrating.",
      "Worked for 2 years then suddenly says I am new and needed to register. When I found my old code, it only gave me 2 weeks of my schedule and says I have not been scheduled. When it works it is great. Also wish I could look at past schedules.",
      "Every time there is an update the app wants a registration code why can't I just sign in like with every other apk on the planet? Also if you complain on Google play store the automatic reply is that they are Keen to solve your problem. Who talks like that? Contact your manager for the code??? Complete lack of support.",
      "We have had this app for work for a few years now and it's terrible. It hardly ever works properly, there's no consistent forms of IT support or annual updates, half of our employees don't show up and the other half contain people we have fired from our store weeks ago. Also if an employee does not have the app, they will sometimes not show on the schedule. Awful attempt at a good idea, wish we would switch to something else."

      "Well they took mine down from earlier this summer so here it goes again. They're not supporting this app any longer. But this one does what the newer app doesn't, which is allow for custom screens with questions that need replies to before you can finish the job. And the fact that I can search all completed work not just what I've been assigned to is why I use this one along with the other... Why should I need 2 apps to do job of 1? The picture option is horrible on this one as they all look blurry when trying to find an old pic that was taken instead of adding picture while I'm in front of the unit. Searching for pics after the fact is all but useless and obsurred. The new app does a good job of picture adding. Verizon needs to get it together in order to compete in a market where we have other options.",

One of the times I even used it to book someone to come the same day. I'm not someone who loves doing things over the phone so this has been great-- plus it's faster because I know all my info is already in the app, saving me having to answer questions over the phone.",
      "This app SUCKS and never works. It works flawlessly on iOS, but not android. Do I really have to buy an iPhone just for this stupid app? Seriously, android has tons more users than iOS. Take care of this app as much as you do on iOS. I just wanted to book a care center for me kids on a certain day and this thing would never work. It launches just fine, but when I hit the \"call us\" button, the app force closes every freaking time. I had to borrow my wife's iPhone to complete my request. This is messed up. Now, I can't even check the status of my request. Every time I wanted to I'd have to borrow her iPhone again. WTH.",

      "Two stars because its essentially a less useful version of the website. However, this can be fixed. Three things I would love to see from W2W to help do this are: - The ability to have my schedule automatically sync with my Google Calendar. Or something of the sort. - A sleeker, and more lag free experience. Right now, theres a three second minimum buffer between when I click a button and anything happening. - Push notifications, so that I'm notified about messages & changes to the schedule.",
      "Very easy to use. Ready to ask for time off and notified you of there was a change to your schedule",
      "This app is very helpful for keeping me up to date with when I have to work. I get my schedules weekly. My only complaint is that I sometimes have to go back and forth with clicks on stuff before I get to the screen I want to see. It would be nice if you guys can dumb things down a bit so those simple minded can better use this app. So it's not to complicated to get to where you wanna go. It should be as simple as opening the app and with just a single click you are on the screen you wanna see."

I also love that the app allows feedback between employee and employer after submitting your hours worked that day.",

      "Been using this App for more than two years. It is an excellent app as I work shifts on a 5 week cycle. I have changed phones a couple of times and the help I have got from the Team has been excellent. The app allows me to view different shifts at a glance on a particular day. For example I can see what shift I am working on a particular day and also if its the children's school holiday. Can't find any other app that does that. Keep up the good work.Very impressed with the team behind the scene",
      "I have used this app for years now. In the whole it's great user than when trying to extend it. By this I mean when you first set it up you project it into the future. Once you reach that projected date you need to extend it further which is never that easy. When you contact the app to ask for help they take ages to reply !",
      "I have been using this app for a few years and it's great. I can have multiple shifts on a single day (android) as well as notes for appointments and such as well. The only thing that would make it 5 stars for me would be if it was shareable. It would be helpful if my husband could view my schedule to know when I am working and when I am off for organizing daily life without me having to share screenshots or adding my shifts manually to my Google calendar for him.",
      "Amazing app for shifts for 1 or more people. One of very few apps that u can see more than 1 shift per day so great for a couple. The designers of this app have never failed to correct and change things on request of its customers. Great app and great communication from the designers. Thank you so much. I love this app.",
      "The perfect app for shift workers !! I have been using this app since 2 years now and it has been a life saver with regarding to organizing my shifts, allowing me to share my rota with others and incorporating 2 rotas into simultaneously (mine and my partner's). The app allows you to create as many as 10+ shift types with different icons and colours and applying rolling shift patterns to whatever period of time you wish with a few clicks. The IT support has been fab in fixing glitches too!"

      "Interface is just as clunky as the web version, i.e., it's pretty mediocre. Three stars. BUT it loses another star because the app won't stop sending me push notifications (with vibrate alerts) even though every notification options is turned off and my phone is silenced. I had to disable the app's notification permissions entirely.",
      "Extremely slow. For the money you take from us freelancers, you can just as well hire one to make this app work like with acceptable speed. It takes me through 4 (four) spinning wheel screens and about 5 seconds before showing me a chat. This is a native app c'mon people.",
      "Not a bad platform but needs to force employers to give either confirmation or reject offer, because offers just hang there for weeks... Also 20% is very discouraging for beginners. That needs to be lower. Hell even 10%cut is a lot, especially for beginners."

We get paid on the 1st and 15th, so variable pay range is needed, as well as OT and a note section. Its a good app until trying to establish OT, or when \"invoicing\" a pay period. I cant figure out how to get OT working, even after a long search, I found something with OT after such and such time at such and such rate, (not 1.5 for time and a half). I tried it, nothing happened for OT. Confusing.",

      "Very good xperience but remove \"Discover feature\" enhance setting features, must be necessary Dark mode , and plz msg writing feature its important for chatting, must be add wallpaper and love this app love this",
      "Overall it is nice app, but devrlopers are required to provide some option for chat Backup and Restore, upon switching to and other smartphone, there is no any option to get chat backup from previous device. There is some option to download the chat. But it it sucks the time, and what to do for restoring? Kaizala do have WhatsApp web like feature, but we never receive OTP to pair our device with the desktop app."

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and at the login section, when pressing Skip, I am unable to press any of the buttons on the next pop-up confirming that I want to skip login.",
      "Doesn't save my searches or save any jobs. Always freezing or crashing. I can't even upload my resume. I've tried updating from my phone, google drive, and dropbox. For some reason it keeps saying the upload failed and it is not because of the size or format. Every time I attempt to put in the information by typing I just get a blank screen and it freezes up. I can't even see what information/email I used to sign up with so that I can just try and do it on my laptop",
      "The search function does not work right. I would like to search for jobs across the country and the location setting is \"(optional)\"; however, it will not conduct a search unless you put in a location. It becomes very tedious to have to search city by city. This should be corrected. Also, the instructions for closing an account lead to a bunch of dead ends. There are no close account options under the profile settings as noted in the help section.",
      "It has been somewhat easy to use but definitely still needs improvements such as allowing me to file jobs that I have applied for into its own category so that when I get a response from employers, I can go find the relevant job description for reference (the existing \"Applied Jobs\" tab is useless). Jobs by proximity doesn't seem to do much help."

      "Love this app. The ease of being able to sort hours by jobs is awesome. Only thing ( and I seen it on here before) I wish I could view the jobs together as well. That way I know I'm working ______ from such and such time and _______ today, with out having to bounce between them to keep track of the days scheldule not just the jobs. However this app makes a world of difference in being able to keep track of everything.",
      "Like this app much. Used it for a couple years. Functional... especially the ability to add multiple jobs. However there are a few additions that would blow it out of the water for me. One is to be able to view the shifts I've worked in a specified period (say pay period) across multiple job names. Such as select jobs from list and view the hours worked for them in a pay period. The other is to be able to Mark hours as paid so that a subtotal of unpaid hours is viewable.",
      "I use this app everyday. It's great. The \"pro\" version supports multiple jobs, so I use it to track hours for some of my classes at school as well as my part-time job, and any side-projects I do. Works well. Feature request -- for the developers: When I \"punch in\", I can't tell which job the shift is going into. Could you add a dropdown on the \"punch in\" screen that allows me to both see and change the active job? I've screwed up my timesheets a couple times because of this.",
      "LOVE this app!! I've been using this for over 3 years and it's never failed me. Its helpful to be able to put it automated shifts...so if you work 9-5 most days you can set that. This app allows you to put in your hourly wage so you can get an idea of what your paycheck will be. You can edit, look back to a specific day and what I really love you can send as a pdf! It's a really helpful little app that didn't cost much to upgrade to pro. I definitely recommend this app!",
      "I'm self employed and love using this app to quickly calculate hours on jobs for clients. It's simple, straightforward and allows great flexibility as it has been developed to be seemless and quick to use while allowing daily extensive customizations. Buy it and you'll be pleased you did. Kudos guys!"

      "Tried using the app when it first debuted, it was confusing. I signed up as an employer due to the unclear layout of app. Was surprised when I had a dev reach out to me the same night I signed up, in hindsight it's because I had signed up as an employer ($$$.) I let the guy know I was looking for work and wasn't an employer, he said he'd fix my profile, never did. Try to deactivate my account so I can sign up as a worker but can't, but honestly I have no reason to trust these guys at this point",
      "Easy 1 day jobs get paid same day or next day most of the time. First payment takes a couple days. Really great app",
      "They charge an \"insurance fee\" of $2.50. Then they pressure you to confirm weather to work or not within 24 hours of accepting a job. If you don't, they'll remove you. And after you do accept, and withdrawl afterwards, they'll suspend you for three days. The pay takes 2 to 3 bussiness days to get to your account. I would use this only when you really need the money. Otherwise, just get a real job. Not worth all of the trouble.",

But it's widget provide only one month view on home screen. If there would be a year view of shift work on home screen widget, then its productivity of planning for holidays and leave managing will be great out come. Will you please work on it? Please provide a year view of shift work schedule in home screen widget. Thanks.",

Yet the calender says i did a lot. Very annoying. I'm waiting for it to get fixed. In the meantime in looking for a similar app.",

Compose email option to send email from which acc although u can set default. My email acc use both either pop or imap version. Works well with gsuite and also standard hosting email setting. Can view email in full screen which is a plus as some of the email subscribed news are hard to view on other email apps like gmail. The only worries as paid member this app wont be like others eventually have to shut down due to profitability. Other then that had not encounter issue on search email or attachment which i read from other reviews and no crash issue so far."

I should be able to prefill these fields one time, NOT auto fill each time.",

      "Very useful for tracking time worked across different projects and clients, and keeping track of how much is owed, in total and per client/project. Provided exactly what I needed over the last 2 years, and then some additional features which I haven't worked out but may be useful to me in future. Very minor tweaks and bug fixes - it is very focussed on tracking tasks now, but adding those in the past is a bit less intuitive. However this doesn't stop this being my choice for time tracking app.",
      "Solid app. Love the different time scale options and both graph types (bar chart over a time range, overall pie chart). It's also fairly easy to add work sessions that you forgot to start the timer for. CSV exporting is awesome, but what really brought me back to Timesheet was the dark theme. Much easier on the eyes, and integrated a beautiful new color scheme.",
      "Hopefully, I will never need to use any other timekeeping app. This one is great. Probably will buy a desktop subscription soon, to clear up some data mis-inputs, by the end of each month. One feature I would appreciate is a permament list of clients, the same way there is a list for projects, so that client name does not have to by typed in for a new project, but rather selected, the same way project are selected in new tasks. This would bring a 6 star rating :)",
      "Been using for a while, it's an excellent tool to track when on-call taking phone calls and tracking your activity. Just download when completed to excel, print, sign, submit!!",
      "App works great for keeping time on jobs, and multiple jobs at 1 time. Easy to import to excel as well!"

      "Once I open the app for the first time, I can't make an account or sign in. It keeps saying to click to agree to the terms of service....but there's no box to check that I read and agree to terms of service. I had to sign up through my browser instead.",
      "The reason why I'm rating this app 2 stars is because the filter options gotten worst, it keep saying \"No result\" and when it dont it shows 1 or 3 jobs. I actually got several interviews from it but the chance of getting hired is low because a lot of other people doing it too. When you open the app there's a lot of jobs but when you put filter it stays \"no result \" when match making with your profile because I never gotten a job yet.",
      "Chat field does not populate consistently. After 3 or 4 emails to Merlin I'm still having issues w/Chat. It populated earlier. 2 of the employer questions were several days old. The current job, I unable to reply to the one listing am/was interested in because I click on employer and App crashes.",
      "Its amazing, fast paced working!",
      "Just started this app and it is so cool! It helps recognize you for jobs. Especially it even makes a resume for you in the later process. I had no idea it was going to do that but it did. Now the website will get back to me whenever there's a position that a business might consider me for just wow. I'm amazed and it's simple too wow. I would surely spend money inside this app if you were able to. But it's not that type of app. Creative ideas or marketing packages would be fun in this app. Amazed"

The app freezes every 20 minutes and drains my battery 4x as fast. I would not even recommend this application to my worst enemy, and yet my job requires I use it, or else it would have been gone long ago. A big middle finger salute to whoever designed this disgrace of a piece of software.",

      "Trello has a terrible offline functionality. The app does not auto-save writings in notes, so if you switch to another window, and then switch back, all your progress will be lost. What it does do, however, it auto-formats text for you. If you write \"2*2*2\", or, god forbid, \"- \", be ready for surprise special effects! Bottom line: pick another productivity app.",
      "Trello is a good app for productivity if not the best compared to similar apps, but: 1. There is no card button like in the PC version. 2. There is no option to choose which board I would like to show on my widget. 3. There is no due date of checklists (many people need it because in many cases, different deadline is the point of making checklists). Thank you if Trello wants to consider my recommendations.",
      "I love how simple, user-friendly, and efficient this is for my endless work and personal organization needs. I've been searching for something like this for a while and luckily came across it. I especially like that i can attach pics to lists and have several lists per category. Just awesome. I've haven't needed to use a paper notepad since i found this, cause it's just that easy to use and it opens in a flash, unlike other overloaded apps.",
      "I really like trello. Because of the free and open source and cross platform. There is a premium plan that yiu can buy ehich is nice. I used it every day for almost managing all of my tasks and projects and collaborated with other people. I just don't really like a few of options of layout view.",
      "I manage my own life with Trello just like all projects at work and I can't live without it. The new zoom out button on android is exactly what I needed, because I have a lot of lists and swiping to get to the ones furtjer to the right is pain. However, swiping in zoomed out mode is almost just as slow as when in zoomed in mode, so it is not as beneficial as it could be. Please make it more fluent."

Calender Worked well for my needs, paid premium for the widget which i have found to be one of the better ones, will look at other options due to cost.",

    "description":"Have you ever wonder what tasks you have done a few days ago? Are you having difficulty to write a work report to tell you boss what you have done due to you have trouble to recall the tasks you have performed days or weeks ago? Now there is an app to solve your problem in reporting what you have performed.\r\n\r\nWork Report Helper is designed to help us to track and easily create a report on tasks we performed, when the works are still fresh in our memory. No more hassle of writing work report at the end of the week or month. At the end of the day, week, or month, this app can show a nicely printed report base on what we have recorded. This will help us save our time from writing a weekly or monthly report, and allow us to spend more time in doing our works.\r\n\r\nIf you are the person who multitask on various projects, you may find that this app is useful to help you to track the amount of time you have spent on a particular project within a day, week, or a month.\r\n\r\nIf you are the person who often try to improve in productivity, you may use this app to help you to keep track and analyse the pattern of how you have spent your day working in office, and then find ways to eliminate unnecessary tasks to improve your speed and focus on more important tasks.\r\n\r\nWork Report Helper will start with a simple screen. Every time you finish one task, or need to switch task half way due to other issue coming out, you can click on the 'Add Work Record' to note down what you have done so far. After that, you exit the app and get back to work to focus your next task. If there are other tasks coming your way, you just repeatedly do the same thing with existing task, then switch focus to work on another task.\r\n\r\nWhen there is time to review your works throughout the day, you can click on the 'View Daily Report' button to review what you have contributed so far. At the end of the week, when it is time to submit a weekly report, you can click on the 'View Weekly Report' button to show you the work that you have done in a week. You may do the same thing by clicking on 'View Monthly Report' button if you are the person who usually just write and submit a monthly report.\r\n\r\nInside the 'View Daily Report', 'View Weekly Report', or 'View Monthly Report' screen, a button called 'Export' is placed at the bottom of the screen. Once you click the button, the app will show a list of external apps that can receive the report in plain text. You may select an email app, and then email the report contents back to yourself for further editing in either a laptop or desktop computer, then submit the nicely written report to your boss.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n1a. Once one task is done\r\n1b. Launch the app\r\n1c. Click on 'Add Work Record'\r\n1d. Type in and save  your information\r\n1e. Exit the app\r\n\r\n2a. Once another task is done\r\n2b. Launch the app\r\n2c. Click on 'Add Work Record'\r\n2d. Type in and save your information\r\n2e. Exit the app\r\n\r\n3a. At the end of the week\r\n3b. Launch the app\r\n3c. Click on 'View Weekly Report'\r\n3d. Click on 'Export'\r\n3e. Select 'Gmail' or any other app to export the weekly report\r\n\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n-----------------\r\n2016/10/06 (Version 1.4) - Fix an issue where Weekly report cannot be displayed correctly on selected week number in some countries.\r\n2016/10/06 (Version 1.3) - Fix an issue where previous written data get erased once screen lock is triggered\r\n2016/10/04 (Version 1.2) - Fix a critical bug that causes user lost data recorded in previous version\r\n2016/09/28 (Version 1.1) - Include date and time in exported texts; Update launch icon\r\n2014/03/10 (Version 1.0) - Initial release",

      "It helped me a lot to enhance my productivity. If only, it has a feature that lets you block apps during work time.",
      "Does what the it says on the tin! Perfect for Coronavirus working from home situation as I had tendency to overwork.",
      "Thank you miss. But there is a problem as dark blue bar is more high in graph which shows that I am doing great amount of rest which is not true. How do I correct it so it shows correct result.",
      "This is by far the best pomodoro timer app. The interface is beautiful and the statistics are quite motivating. They compel you towards a better performance than yesterday and one would want to keep the stats( number of hours ) going. Thank you for this amazing app!",
      "Very useful but there seems to be an issue where even though I paused the timer, it isn't technically paused and still rings and acts like I completed the set time."
